"As the Florida Keys were ordered evacuated, residents of the chain of islands and South Florida braced today for Hurricane Michelle, which landed on Cuba and could threaten Florida by dawn. Hurricane Michelle hit Cuba's coast about 70 miles southeast of Havana at 4 p.m. today with winds of up to 135 miles an hour and was hovering over the northern part of the island late tonight, when the wind speed dropped to 110 m.p.h. In a news conference in Havana, President Fidel Castro said 750,000 people had been evacuated, The Associated Press reported. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries in Cuba. The storm has killed 12 in Honduras, Nicaragua and Jamaica. The hurricane knocked out phone lines across Cuba, making communications nearly impossible, The A.P. said. Emergency workers relied on ham radios. Uncertain about the storm's path, officials in Florida ordered a mandatory evacuation of the Florida Keys. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the islands based on projections that hurricane-force winds of 75 miles per hour could reach the area by late this evening and remain into Monday. Gusts and heavy surf were already reported to be pounding the beaches. The evacuation orders came a day after Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency, warning South Florida residents to be prepared for a powerful storm. And Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County has announced the evacuation of an 8 1/2-mile stretch of the city's southwest side and recommended the evacuation of other areas. ''We strongly recommend that residents of mobile homes and unsafe structures in low-lying and flood-prone areas evacuate their homes,'' Mr. Penelas said. He also announced several precautionary measures, including the closing of county schools, the lockdown of area bridges and the opening of several shelters. The hurricane's winds, however, had dropped to 110 miles per hour at 10 p.m., the National Hurricane Center said. The storm is not nearly as powerful as Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida in August 1992, and Hurricane Hugo, which pummeled the Southeast in September 1989. As of this evening, the hurricane had had only a mild impact on Florida, causing showers and gusting winds that flipped umbrellas and scattered patio furniture but appeared to cause no serious damage. But residents and tourists streamed out of the Keys, a chain of some 40 islands stretching 128 miles that have about 80,000 permanent residents. They were headed north on U.S. 1, toward Key Largo and South Miami. ''It went very well so far today,'' said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County Emergency Operations Center. In the Miami area, people stocked up on water, batteries and other supplies, and secured shutters on homes and storefront windows. Gerry Ferrari, a Coast Guard-licensed charter captain who has lived in South Florida for 22 years and owns a 28-foot racing cruiser, took precautions over the weekend to safeguard the sailboat from the storm. ''I took it up the Miami River yesterday,'' Mr. Ferrari said, adding that he felt it was ''absolutely necessary to be prepared.'' It is a lesson that some South Florida residents said they learned after witnessing the devastation of Hurricane Andrew. ''Andrew's memories really do worry me,'' said Karen Kemball, a fine-arts appraiser who lives in Miami. ''That's why I have the shutters ready to close. I bought water and Spam and brought everything off the balcony into the house.'' With only moderate winds and intermittent rains, many people said they did not yet fear the worst. In fact, hundreds of people strolled the trendy Lincoln Road area of South Beach this afternoon, where restaurants were about half full with brunch crowds and boutiques remained open. Carnival and Royal Caribbean cruise ships set sail this evening from the Port of Miami. Officials warned that the storm could threaten Florida by the beginning of the workweek and cautioned against taking it for granted. ''Because it's so late in the season we're concerned that people may let their guard down,'' said Craig Fugate, Florida's emergency management director. This evening the hurricane's center was about 200 miles south of Miami, the National Weather Service said. The storm was moving northeast at nearly 13 miles per hour and was expected to move into the Straits of Florida. In the Bahamas, officials issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern and central islands, which the storm was expected to approach by Monday morning. On its current course, the center of the storm would reach its closest approach to South Florida about 130 miles southeast of downtown Miami in the predawn hours on Monday, the National Hurricane Center said. Mr. Ferrari, the boating enthusiast, said living through previous hurricanes had taught him never to be too confident in the models predicting a storm's path. ''I love to see those graphics with the predicted path of a hurricane,'' Mr. Ferrari said. ''They claim we won't get hit hard. But I'd rather be safe than sorry.''"
"Hurricane Michelle spared South Florida today, hitting the Bahamas instead with winds weakened by its deadly encounter with Cuba on Sunday. By noon, a tropical storm warning had been lifted for South Florida, and residents and tourists were returning to the Florida Keys after being evacuated the day before. Rain fell in in the early morning hours, but the sun peeked through briefly in the afternoon as winds died down. The rain caused minor flooding on some streets in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, and some oceanfront stores farther north, in Hollywood, reported flooding from high surf. In Miami, schools and businesses that were closed today were expected to reopen on Tuesday. In the Keys, there were no reports of serious damage, the authorities said. ''Things here are pretty much back to normal at this point,'' said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Department in Monroe County, which includes the Keys. ''People are taking their shutters down, and businesses are back open.'' Some businesses said the worst damage was to their profits. ''Our business has been slow since Sept. 11 and this really affects us,'' said Rob Bruening, co-owner of the Duval Inn in Key West. ''We were sold out for the week, and then they asked for everyone to evacuate, and we had to send everyone home.'' Tracking to the northeast, the storm hit the Bahamas today with winds of 80 miles an hour, causing some flooding in the capital, Nassau, on New Providence Island. Trees and utility lines were reported knocked down in other parts of the chain of islands. No deaths were reported. By late afternoon winds had dropped to 75 m.p.h., barely hurricane force, and the storm was rapidly moving away from the Bahamas. The storm was expected to continue to weaken in the next 24 hours, the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane had spent much of its energy battering southwestern Cuba on Sunday. Winds of up to 135 m.p.h. ripped the roofs off buildings and felled trees, and high waves and tidal surges caused widespread flooding. It was the worst storm to hit Cuba in half a century. Five people were killed, bringing the death toll from the storm to 17 throughout the Caribbean. Some of Cuba's main sugar-producing provinces were hard hit, with cane fields flooded or destroyed by the winds, and some sugar mills damaged. Banana, coffee and citrus crops were damaged, and power was cut to nearly the entire country. With Cuba's sugar production already at historical lows, the government today mobilized thousands of workers to try to save some of this year's cane crop. President Fidel Castro traveled to the affected provinces to survey the damage, Reuters reported. ''Don't worry, we'll survive the hurricane,'' Mr. Castro said. ''For us, victory means having a minimum loss of human life.''"
"An overnight break here in a five-foot-wide water main serving a cluster of central New Jersey communities left up to a half-million people with low water pressure or no water at all this morning and prompted school closings in six counties, from Piscataway south to Princeton Junction. By midmorning, officials of the Elizabethtown Water Company, which serves the area, had completed the complex task of rerouting water around the break in the main, or trunk line, at a point between Bridgewater and Franklin, where the pipe crosses the Raritan River, and had begun repairs. At that point, water service had been completely restored. Although water pressure to the homes and businesses was gradually returning to normal, the utility continued to advise people to boil water before drinking it, because water that has been stopped in a pipe may be contaminated by sediment. Henry Patterson, the company's vice president for corporate affairs, said no contamination had been found in the system's water, but the company was continuing the advisory for at least 36 hours as a precaution. Water company officials said they were still investigating the cause of the main break, which occurred here about 11:45 p.m. Monday. It sent municipal officials scrambling, summoning tanker trucks into many communities in case a fire broke out while water pressure was low or nonexistent. They also trucked in potable water to several distribution points in preparation for a longer period when tap water might be undrinkable. By sunrise, as water company officials were rerouting water, many residents in the area were waking up to discover faucets that dripped rather than gushed and showers that dribbled rather than drenched. Many of them headed out to stores for bottled water. Stephanie Ditondo, a worker at an assisted-living apartment for developmentally disabled adults in Bound Brook, hurried out to the supermarket this morning to buy several bottles of water for the apartment's residents. School officials in several communities decided for safety and health reasons to close some or all of their schools, or delay openings. The districts that closed schools included Piscataway, South Bound Brook, Bridgewater, Franklin Township, Bound Brook and Middlesex Borough. Of Edison's 17 schools, only the 7 served by the Elizabethtown Water Company were closed. Elizabethtown Water serves about 50 municipalities in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union Counties. Kevin Sumner, health officer for the Middlebrook Regional Health Commission, which serves a number of towns affected by the main break, said much of his day was spent making sure that restaurants, day care centers and dentists' offices knew about the problems and the restrictions on the use of tap water. ''A lot of people were of the opinion that coffee makers boiled water sufficiently to make it drinkable, but we had to tell them that they didn't,'' he said. Mike Gallagher, the fire marshal for Middlesex County, said there were no fire emergencies when pressure was low in the systems serving the area. All the same, his office and others in the area were besieged by early morning calls. Dick Williams, the Middlesex County administrator, said: ''Even though it was on radio and television this morning, our 911 system was flooded with calls from people telling us that the water was there but the pressure wasn't and asking what they should do. It reminded our emergency management people a lot of what happened when Hurricane Floyd hit in 1999, but without the flooding.'' The break in the 14-year-old pipe occurred about 2,000 feet south of the water company's Raritan-Millstone treatment plant, in a line that carries water a little more than a mile to the Franklin treatment plant. The water gushing from the pipe, buried more than eight feet below ground, spewed red clay and shards of native shale over a grassy and isolated area of the pipeline right of way just on the eastern bank of the Raritan River. Bob Collington, the company's executive vice president and chief operating officer, said that through the night, to bypass the break and begin rerouting water, company engineers had to find a half-dozen ''gate valves'' and gradually close them while equalizing the pressure within the system. This required as many as 400 carefully measured turns of the valves controlling the four-foot gates. The entire process took more than five hours, he said. Rerouting the water meant sending up to 70 million gallons per day through alternative pipes that usually carried no more than 20 million gallons per day, said Joe Stroin, senior vice president for operations."
"The Bush administration's hopes of stopping Congress from declaring budget emergencies to ignore spending caps is being threatened by a powerful Republican lawmaker who is usually one of its most reliable allies on Capitol Hill: Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip. Mr. DeLay, the third-ranking Republican in the House, is under pressure from Houston voters in his district to find money to help the city clean up after a huge tropical storm last month. Part of his solution is to put an additional $1.3 billion in this year's budget for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That has startled White House officials and House colleagues who say Mr. DeLay is undermining the administration's efforts to enforce budgetary discipline on Republicans involved in writing appropriations bills. Mr. DeLay's emergency funding request would increase by one-fifth the size of a $6.5 billion bill being considered by Congress to supplement the current fiscal year's budget. The bill is supposed to handle the unanticipated budget needs of several government agencies through the end of the year. On a voice vote earlier this week, the House Appropriations Committee approved a measure by Mr. DeLay to insert the money into next year's federal budget if he was unsuccessful in finding a way to fit it into the supplemental bill for this year. Mr. DeLay, a member of the Appropriations Committee, made clear that he was prompted to request the additional money largely out of a desire to serve his constituents. ''This funding ensures that Houstonians and all Americans can be confident that FEMA is prepared when tragedy strikes,'' he said. The emergency management agency, which has not asked for the extra money, is overseeing the cleanup from Tropical Storm Allison. The storm devastated large parts of Houston and surrounding suburbs with flooding. Many Democrats support an increase in the agency's budget, and they clearly enjoyed the spectacle of a Republican who relishes his reputation as a budget-cutting conservative standing up to the White House and demanding that more money be made available to help his district. Mr. DeLay is known among colleagues as ''the hammer,'' in part because of his insistence on fiscal discipline among House Republicans. ''Mr. DeLay is doing a modern-day version of St. Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus, saying we need more money rather than less,'' said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. ''He is just confirming what we have said from the beginning: that the Republican budget is totally unrealistic.'' A House Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. DeLay's Republican colleagues were ''dumbfounded'' by his move. ''This makes it much more difficult to maintain discipline on other issues,'' the lawmaker said. White House and House Republican officials said they were blindsided by Mr. DeLay's request, which they said undermined an aggressive campaign by President Bush and his budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., to prevent House Republicans from trying to push money for hometown projects into appropriations bills. White House officials walked on rhetorical eggshells in criticizing Mr. DeLay's request while trying not to antagonize Mr. DeLay, whose support is vital to the White House on virtually every major policy issue before Congress. ''We know of the congressman's keen interest on this,'' said Chris Ullman, a spokesman for the White House budget office. ''But we believe FEMA has adequate resources for the current fiscal year. We believe no more funding should be added to the supplemental.''"
"The Atlantic Seaboard and the Caribbean face 10 to 40 years of stronger and more frequent hurricanes, a new analysis of weather data shows. As a result, crowded coastlines and islands are confronted with the greatest risk of devastation in a generation, said the scientists who conducted the study. Many meteorologists said the new analysis provided the firmest evidence yet that cycles in ocean and atmospheric conditions that suppressed big storms from 1971 to 1994 had shifted into a storm-spawning state. The number and power of storms first jumped in 1995, but only now have enough years passed to measure a significant trend, the researchers said. In a paper in today's issue of Science, they say the driving force is a periodic warming of the Atlantic north of the Equator and a simultaneous drop in wind shear, the difference between trade winds near the surface and winds at higher altitudes. Tropical storms thrive on energy and moisture supplied by warmer water. In addition, the lack of clashing winds aloft allows the resulting cyclones to mushroom miles high, the researchers reported. Conditions were similar from the 1920's through the 1960's, the study said. But coasts that were sparsely populated then are now dense with people, high-rise apartment buildings and summer homes, said Stanley B. Goldenberg, the lead author of the study and a meteorologist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane research center in Miami. The greater frequency of stronger storms, combined with more people and buildings, spells a far greater risk of having a storm become a $100 billion disaster, Mr. Goldenberg said. ''It's like shooting arrows at a target,'' he said. ''The more arrows you shoot, the more likely you are to get a bull's-eye. The problem now is there are not only more arrows, but there are more targets because of the coastal buildup.'' In the Caribbean the biggest risk is of enormous loss of life. In the United States, it is enormous losses of property, Mr. Goldenberg said. ''It's not only the number of new buildings, but their heights,'' Mr. Goldenberg said. ''Recent research here has shown that in strong storms, at around 300 to 500 feet you get tremendous peaks in winds'' that can have twice the force of winds at the surface. Those potent gusts, he said, can easily rip the skin off a skyscraper. In the study, the scientists said the return to cooler waters and more wind shear -- and thus less stormy times -- could happen in 10 years, but was likely to persist much longer. They said no one knew what drove the cycle of warming and cooling in the North Atlantic, and the relationship between the water temperature and wind shifts was being studied. Other scientists injected a note of caution, saying the recent string of stormy years was still too short to constitute a clear trend. In a separate analysis in Science, Dr. Lennart Bengtsson, a climatologist at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, said patterns of hurricane activity were nearly impossible to discern with only a few decades of data. But he agreed that countries with vulnerable coasts could suffer huge economic losses if they did not prepare for the worst and the worst happened. ''A change to what was typical, say, for 1920 to 1960 would create a potentially serious situation requiring most urgent attention,'' he wrote in Science. Dr. Bengtsson and the authors of the new study said the link between warmer seas and hurricane patterns did not necessarily mean that global warming would spawn more such storms. One reason given by Dr. Bengtsson was that, in a generally warmer world, the air above the ocean would warm as well as the water, reducing the contrast that drives the formation of storms. The new study generated a picture of a tempestuous future by closely tracking sea temperature and wind shear measurements over the last century -- taken by ships and weather balloons -- and comparing patterns with the frequency, severity and tracks of hurricanes from the 1940's until now. The team limited its full analysis to 1944 to 2000, a stretch with the best data. Graphs of hurricane frequency meshed well with graphs of water temperature, particularly in the region west of the bulge of Saharan Africa, where most tropical storms begin. Although the relationship between the shifts in water temperatures and wind shear are still not understood, the pattern is consistent and clear, said Dr. Christopher W. Landsea, a colleague of Mr. Goldenberg at the hurricane center and a co-author of the paper. ''The atmosphere and ocean are talking to each other,'' Dr. Landsea said. The research adds detail and new lines of evidence to earlier predictions of a stormier future by another of the co-authors, Dr. William M. Gray of Colorado State University, and to separate studies by Dr. James B. Elsner, a hurricane authority at Florida State University. There is still plenty of variability year to year, with the recent quiet stretch including, for example, the devastating Hurricane Andrew in 1992. So there is no reason to think that the 2001 hurricane season or any particular coming year will be exceptionally catastrophic, the scientists said. And plenty of other weather factors and changes influence hurricanes. Most notable is El Niño, a condition that develops in the Pacific once or twice a decade and suppresses hurricanes by shifting eastward-flowing winds. But already, the researchers said, 1995 to 2000 had hurricanes form at a rate twice as great as seen in the preceding quiet period. Moreover, the frequency of strong storms, those with sustained winds of more than 110 miles per hour, is 2.5 times as high as it was. They added that the recent stormy years have also seen a five-fold increase in hurricanes in the Caribbean, including Hurricane Mitch in October 1998, which killed more than 11,000 people. The prospect of more exceptionally strong storms is particularly troubling because their destructive power rises enormously for even a small increase in wind speed. For example, Mr. Goldenberg said, winds of 130 m.p.h. have almost double the punch of winds of 100 m.p.h. ''The strong storms produce more than 80 percent of all hurricane damage even though they only account for one-fifth of the storms that make landfall,'' Dr. Landsea said. Correction: July 24, 2001, Tuesday A front-page article on Friday about the likelihood of stronger, more frequent hurricanes misstated part of the name of the agency that oversees the hurricane research center. It is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, not Oceanographic."
"Barry Mandel, director of the downtown Theater District Association, stood outside Jones Hall today, home to the Houston Symphony, and listened not to violins but to the groan of a generator pumping water from the flooded bowels of the auditorium. Below, the music library may be ruined. Instruments are floating in chest-deep water. Across the street, the basement stage inside the Alley Theater was drenched, and the electrical system was broken. Next door at the Wortham Theater Center, the performance hall for the city's ballet and opera, the costumes for the coming performance of ''Cleopatra'' that were stored in the underground dressing rooms may be ruined. Like nearly everyone else in this bayou city, Mr. Mandel was stunned by the ferocity of Tropical Storm Allison, which was blamed for at least 20 deaths and which dropped nearly three feet of water in some places last weekend. But in explaining the tremendous flooding downtown, Mr. Mandel pointed not to the sky, but below, to a set of doors that opened into a tunnel. ''The water,'' he said, ''came from there.'' The explanation for the record flooding here last weekend is fairly simple. It rained so much and so fast that the drainage system in this table-top city laced with bayous was overwhelmed as neighborhoods became lakes and highways became canals. But downtown, the water also rushed down the ramps of parking garages and poured through some sections of the maze of tunnels that shield pedestrians from the weather and connect the city's signature skyscrapers, particularly around the Theater District, creating a flood above ground and below. ''This really was a flood that was totally out of the realm of experience or expectation down here,'' said Joseph Colaco, a University of Houston professor who worked as a structural engineer on many of the downtown skyscrapers. With floodwaters having receded, problems were still evident today even as life seemed fairly normal. Away from downtown, the Texas Medical Center, home to an array of hospitals and research institutions, continued to struggle with power failures and underground flooding. Officials with the Compaq Center canceled Thursday's game for the city's women's professional basketball team. Thousands of people continued to work on flooded homes and businesses. The arena is now dry, but during the flood the basketball court itself was floating on four feet of water. People returned to office buildings downtown today, but work crews continued furiously pumping water from below Jones Hall and other nearby buildings, including at least two skyscrapers. At the peak of the flooding early Saturday, the three-level underground parking garage for the Theater District was believed to be filled with 87 million gallons of water. Half of that amount must still be removed. Usually, the city beneath the city, is a respite from the weather. Just as people in Minneapolis can walk on skyways from building to building to stay warm in winter, Houstonians can move beneath the city during the boiling summers through the air-conditioned tunnels, as well as eat at underground food courts and shop at underground stores. Today, much of the tunnel system was unaffected and was open. Mr. Colaco, the structural engineer, characterized the flooding as unprecedented and said that problems downtown did not mean that the tunnels were prone to flooding. Houston is not the only American city to suffer underground flooding in its business and commercial district. In April 1992, the Chicago Loop was closed for a week when a freight tunnel under the Chicago River was breached, sending nearly 250 million gallons of water coursing through the city's tunnel system and into basements. City Hall and the Sears Tower, as well as the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, were closed by the flooding. The Houston flooding was at its worst in the Theater District, where the tunnels were transformed into rivers that flowed into the performance halls and wreaked considerable damage, if not to the main performance stages, then to nearly everything else. That flooding was accentuated by the district's location -- all four of the city's main performance halls face Jones Plaza, a short walk from the waters of Buffalo Bayou. The impact on the city's cultural life was immediate. Two performances of ''Giselle'' have been canceled, and the coming weekend performances are uncertain. ''The Carpetbagger's Children,'' the Horton Foote play that had its world premiere last week at the Alley Theater, has been moved to a theater a few miles away. Jennifer Garza, a spokeswoman for the Alley Theater, said that the basement-level stage being used for the Foote production was heavily damaged and that the theater's electrical system was not working. ''It suffered extensive damage from water that came in through the tunnel system,'' Ms. Garza said. She also said the theater's underground offices suffered greatly as water damaged artist renderings for set designs and other materials, ''things that are irreplaceable,'' Ms. Garza said. Air-conditioning and electrical power were restored today at the Wortham Theater Center. The above-ground parts of the building were mostly dry, but water poured through the underground hallways, dressing rooms and costume shops. Only today were officials with the ballet able to survey the damage. An earlier video taken by an employee sloshing through the hallways in chest waders showed toppled costume boxes, drenched dressing rooms and other extensive damage. Cecil C. Conner Jr., managing director of the Houston Ballet, said he feared for the condition of the costumes for the company's coming production of ''Cleopatra,'' a wardrobe for 50 dancers valued at $200,000, including the jeweled gown worn by the principal dancer, Lauren Anderson. A decision will be made later this week on whether the final performances of ''Giselle'' will be held this weekend, Mr. Conner said. ''There are lots of people who are making their debuts in 'Giselle,' '' he said, ''and some ballerinas are retiring. We don't want them to lose this opportunity, and we don't want the city to lose the opportunity to see them.'' None of the companies suffered more than the Houston Symphony. The main auditorium of Jones Hall sustained little damage, but offices below, as well as those of the Society for the Performing Arts, were all but destroyed. Water from the tunnels rushed through with such force that the glass walls of some offices were shattered. Computers were ruined and files waterlogged. Rehearsal halls were inundated. Art Kent, a symphony spokesman, said the immediate concern was the music library, with its thousands of scores from past performances. Mr. Kent said officials with NASA had already agreed to use freezing technology to try to save the music sheets. But until the water is fully pumped out, they cannot get to the scores and the delay decreases the chances of saving them. Christine Pastorek, a violinist who joined the symphony in 1969, called the library ''the lifeblood of your orchestra.'' Mr. Kent, the spokesman, said three Steinway pianos that were damaged were valued at $250,000. A double bass trapped in the room is valued at $100,000. If the flooding was horrific for the symphony, the timing was a little better. The symphony had just completed its subscription series at Jones Hall and will spend the summer performing for children and on an outdoor suburban stage. In fact, the first performance in the summer series was today. ''Many of us lost automobiles and had problems at home,'' Ms. Pastorek said of the floods, explaining why some musicians failed to attend today's concert. ''But we had a full complement on stage. Luckily, these stages are smaller.''"
"Clarence Watkins, a head lineman for Reliant Energy, the local utility, considers himself at war. He works in the afternoon and evening -- what might be described as mosquito prime time in this city still recovering from huge rains and flooding -- and defends himself with a style of slapping and leg-kicking akin to Irish line dancing. ''I've got a long-sleeve shirt and two good slapping arms,'' said Mr. Watkins, 37. ''It's like 300 of them and one of you. It's like fighting a small army. You can hear them. You know they are coming.'' First came the rains. Now the mosquitoes. They are everywhere, a swarm of science-fiction-like proportions spawned by the torrential rains and flooding here wrought earlier this month by Tropical Storm Allison. The flooding caused an estimated $4.88 billion in local property damage that may take months or longer to repair. It has also raised long-range questions about whether this city encircled by bayous must rethink its readiness for huge amounts of rainfall. But, really, the main topic of conversation is mosquitoes. There are about 3.1 million people in Houston and surrounding Harris County. Officials say hundreds of millions of mosquitoes may have taken flight since the flood. It is not a fair fight. As yet, the mosquitoes are not considered a health risk, but it is still an act of bravery to go outside, to collect the morning newspaper, to water the plants. It is so bad that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has taken the unusual step of offering to reimburse the city for most of its mosquito spraying costs. The Houston Chronicle even ran a magnified front-page photograph of a mosquito crawling along the nose of a 12-year-old boy as if it were King Kong scaling the Empire State Building. In this, one of the nation's most hermetically sealed cities, no place is completely mosquito-free: They have been spotted in the air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels that run beneath downtown and inside the city's skyscrapers. ''I work on the 27th floor, and I don't know how a mosquito got up there,'' said Roland Esparza, 42, who was bitten twice inside his office. ''I told a co-worker, 'You know, we need to get these mosquitoes and find out how they get in the building, ride up the elevator, go up to the 27th floor and find me.' '' Bugs are not exactly a new phenomenon to Houston. Heat, humidity and rainfall -- mother's milk to much of the insect world -- are found in abundance here. The cockroaches are big enough to frighten small children. Hardware stores stock pesticides the way drug stores stock aspirin. The world's first indoor stadium, the Astrodome, was built as a refuge from the heat and mosquitoes of the city's summers. The area's most powerful politician, Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, began his career as an exterminator. In all, 55 species of mosquitoes call Houston home, and even under normal conditions man often wages a losing battle against them. But this outbreak is the worst in memory, said Dr. Ray Parsons, head of Harris County Mosquito Control. He said it was the custom of the different types of floodwater mosquitoes to scatter their eggs in the soil. If there is not much spring rain, the eggs do not hatch. Tropical Storm Allison hammered the region for five days ending June 10 so severely that for one 24-hour period some areas reported nearly three feet of rain. As a result, Dr. Parsons said, millions upon millions of mosquitoes were hatched last week. To measure the problem, the control board dispatched inspectors and ''surveillance specialists'' to stand like scarecrows beneath trees and wait for 60 seconds. Then, each inspector and specialist counted the number of mosquitoes that landed on their body. Anything more than 25 landings every 60 seconds is considered bad; some inspectors reported rates exceeding 100 landings a minute. It was this rate that prompted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to offer to reimburse local governments for up to 75 percent of the cost of spraying. ''I don't think there is any place that is mosquito-free,'' Dr. Parsons said, admitting that he had done a little field work outside his house recently and counted 50 landings. He said the problem might not ease for two to three weeks, even though municipal officials said that as many as 33 trucks would be out spraying this evening. If there is good news, it is that no cases of disease have been reported, as happened in New York last year when mosquitoes carried the West Nile Virus. Still, Houston officials declared the mosquitoes a health hazard this week based on their sheer numbers and after complaints from hospitals at the sprawling Texas Medical Center, about three miles from downtown. Many of the hospitals suffered basement flooding and power outages and had to open their windows to dry out or catch a breeze. The mosquitoes flew right in. ''These bugs are horrible,'' said Diane Roskar, 39, who lives near the medical center. ''I have to run from my front door to my car because I'm getting bitten. They come in my home. I'm trying to fix dinner and they are flying up my skirt, biting me.'' Like so many people here, Mrs. Roskar and her neighbor, Margie Eisen, have decided that the best defense is to simply stay indoors. Ms. Eisen, 44, and her husband, Jim Auwerda, 45, invited friends of their son, Nicholas, to have a baseball game on Saturday for his ninth birthday party. Usually, this would be no problem. But the mosquitoes were so bad, the game was called in the second inning. ''I'm thinking that lawsuits are coming my way because the parents were saying their kids were being eaten alive,'' Ms. Eisen said. Instead, everyone jumped in the backyard pool. ''The pool is a good place to get away from the bugs,'' Mr. Auwerda explained, ''as long as you stay underwater.''"
"Three people were killed here this weekend and more than 10,000 were forced to flee their homes by the tropical storm Allison, which has dumped up to 26 inches of rain in a little more than 24 hours. The storm, which has lingered over the Texas and Louisiana coasts for nearly a week, flooded area freeways, shuttered businesses and forced nine of Houston's largest hospitals to declare internal emergencies. President Bush declared Harris County and 27 other nearby counties disaster areas this afternoon, and by evening employees of the Federal Emergency Management Administration were on their way to the city. The declaration made residents eligible for low-rate relief loans, grants and other financial assistance. Emergency officials used boats, helicopters and high-water rescue vehicles today to evacuate thousands of residents trapped by rapidly rising floodwaters. Rob Wyman, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the agency's three local helicopter crews were concentrating on medical emergencies as a first priority for air evacuation, leaving many others stranded. ''There are more people out there on rooftops than we can possibly even count, much less help,'' Mr. Wyman said. The three deaths were reported tonight. One man drowned along a bayou and a woman drowned while trapped in a flooded elevator in the basement of the Bank of America building downtown. Another man died when his car was submerged in water under a bridge. Already saturated by days of heavy rains, dozens of creeks and bayous that snake through downtown Houston leaped their banks after Friday night's downpour and flowed into streets and nearby neighborhoods. The city's skyscrapers seemed themselves to be emerging from the sea, and pressure from rising floodwaters caused 20-foot geysers to spurt from the expansion cracks in freeway overpasses. By this evening, the water had receded in many parts of the city. But abandoned cars and trucks snarled traffic throughout the city, and dozens of intersections remained underwater as darkness fell. At the Texas Medical Center near the city center, nurses were reportedly hand-ventilating patients on respirators and using stairways to race between floors to deliver medicines after power failures shut down the elevators. And hospitals throughout the city were urging that nonemergency patients be taken to facilities in Austin or Dallas. ''We would plead of the Houston community that this combined resource be used only for life-threatening critical services that need an intensive care unit, need specialized facilities, or need an immediate operation,'' said Dr. Ken Mattox, chief of the trauma unit at the Ben Taub hospital. ''The storm has crippled every hospital in the Texas Medical Center.'' All major highways into the city had some flooding, and along the Katy Freeway on Houston's west side, 18-wheeled tractor-trailer rigs were reported swept from the roadway by rapidly rising water. The city's fire chief, Danny Smith, said, ''I've lived here all my life and I've never seen flooding like this.'' His department received over 2,500 emergency calls between 5 p.m. Friday and 11 a.m. today. ''They're all stranded motorists or people in residences calling to be evacuated,'' Chief Smith said. State disaster officials dispatched 26 high-water vehicles and 22 boats to the area, and surrounding communities raced to get additional rafts and boats into Houston to help with evacuations. In one neighborhood in southeast Houston, residents ferried pets and clothing to higher ground using swimming pool rafts. City officials hope some of the water will recede before the next deluge, but forecasters are predicting more rain for tonight and Sunday as Allison churns offshore in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. ''We really need a couple of days without rain to get any drainage,'' said Wes Johnson, a spokesman for the city's Department of Public Works and Engineering. Of particular concern, Mr. Johnson said, are residents who are wading in the water. Like the sewage systems in most cities, Houston's system has ventilation holes to prevent the buildup of potentially explosive methane gas. Floodwaters have flowed into the openings and carried raw sewage back out. ''We're trying to make people understand that they could get a serious infection if they are out there knee deep in the water,'' Mr. Johnson said. Meteorologists said the system appeared to be heading back to the gulf, where it might gather strength. In Louisiana, The Associated Press reported, dozens of alligators stirred up by the storm's thunder, lightning and heavy rain have been wandering into residential areas. Kathy Smith did not believe her daughter had really seen an alligator in their yard in LaPlace, La., until she saw a neighbor trying to catch one on Friday. ''I said, 'You get him, and I'm about to call 911,' '' she told the news service. In Houston, just driving home could be an adventure. G. J. Loh and his wife, Jennifer, left downtown shortly before midnight Friday for their home on the west side of Houston, a trip that normally takes 30 minutes. They arrived home about 6:30 this morning. ''We drove through water where it was extremely difficult to judge how high it was,'' Mr. Loh said. ''You almost didn't know until the car in front of you went through or you took your chances. Once you go there's no turning back.'' Corey Ray, a spokesman for Mayor Lee P. Brown, said 3,000 homes and businesses had been damaged so far by the storm and estimated that 10,000 people would need some type of housing because their homes had been affected by rising water. But officials believe those numbers could rise if Allison regains strength and continues to pound the Texas coast. ''We're in a 'wait and see' situation,'' Mr. Ray said."
"The soggy remnants of Tropical Storm Allison slowly pinwheeled across the Middle Atlantic states yesterday, flooding roads, topping off streams and testing patience in the New York metropolitan region before sweeping north and beginning a sluggish turn out to sea. Unlike the deadly mix of wind and water that claimed at least 43 lives since Allison touched ground on June 5 in the Gulf states, the rains that accompanied the weakening storm as it trekked across this region yesterday proved to be little more than an annoyance. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- where as much as 5.5 inches of rain fell -- officials late yesterday reported numerous road closings caused by flash flooding but no serious injuries or property damage. Things were more severe, however, in Pennsylvania, which National Weather Service officials said was the hardest hit area in the Middle Atlantic after being soaked yesterday with more than 10 inches of rain in some parts. Four people were killed Saturday in Upper Moreland Township, Pa., about 16 miles north of Philadelphia, when a fire struck a flooded apartment complex. Firefighters, who had been hindered from battling the blaze by rising floodwaters, were still searching yesterday for two residents of the complex missing since the fire. Flash-flood warnings remained in effect in some parts of the New York region through midafternoon yesterday even as badly flooded parts of southern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania began the process of drying out. Residents there began surveying flooded homes and submerged some vehicles. ''In some areas, this is probably the worst since Floyd,'' said Bob Stauber, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Mount Holly, N.J., referring to the record flooding from Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999. Mr. Stauber said that effects of the storm varied widely throughout the region. ''Down here in Mount Holly, it was heavy but it didn't cause too much problems,'' Mr. Stauber said. ''But if you were under that 10 inches. . . .'' Weather service officials said the highest 24-hour rainfall numbers were recorded in Chalfont, Pa., which was soaked with more than 10 inches. ''Well, we're wet,'' one dispatcher with the Chalfont Police Department said. ''What else do you want to know?'' While the storm caused many evacuations in Pennsylvania, the authorities in the New York region late yesterday reported only limited evacuations, like at a Fairfield, N.J., hotel where guests were forced out because of concerns about standing water on the roof. The storm also led to some delays at Newark International Airport Saturday night, but scheduled flights were running smoothly yesterday, airport officials said. Although the storm knocked out power for about 50,000 people around Philadelphia, public utilities officials in the New York region reported no widespread disruptions. In one of the largest power failures around New York, Con Edison reported that about 1,300 customers in Mount Vernon were left without power for about an hour after a lightning strike early yesterday morning. Utility workers were still trying to restore power to some of the roughly 3,000 others who lost electricity throughout the region yesterday. ''Most of them are back,'' said Martha Liipfert, a Con Edison spokeswoman. ''We're still working on the others and, of course, we'll stay out there until everyone is restored.'' New Jersey Department of Transportation officials reported that scores of local roadways -- and parts of such major thoroughfares as Routes 35 and 36 -- flooded yesterday. However, as waters began to recede, virtually all of the major roads were passable last night. In Westchester County, parts of the Bronx River Parkway and the Saw Mill River Parkway were closed temporarily yesterday. ''We've had a lot of local flooding,'' said Lt. Michael Palumbo of the Westchester County police. Meteorologists with the National Weather Service said that the remains of the storm would continue to move northeast into New England and into the Atlantic Ocean possibly as early as this morning. They also warned that the wet weather might not be gone long: forecasts call for sunshine today and tomorrow but a chance of showers Wednesday night."
"As storm-weary residents emerged from their waterlogged homes here today, they faced highways littered with jackknifed 18-wheeled trucks, roads lined with abandoned cars, trash and tires and whole neighborhoods underwater. Tropical Storm Allison, which caught just about everyone off guard when it struck with renewed strength on Friday and early Saturday, hammered southeast Texas for nearly a week, leaving at least 15 people dead and about 10,000 homes and 5,000 buildings damaged. One person also died in Louisiana as a result of the storm. [Page A12.] With the threat of rain easing today in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry toured the area by helicopter with Mayor Lee P. Brown and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Administration. Mayor Brown has estimated that at least 5,000 buildings in Houston were damaged by water, with losses perhaps reaching $1 billion. In light of the storm's devastation, President Bush has declared Harris County and 27 other southeast Texas counties a federal disaster area, eligible for loans to local governments and individuals. ''We're still assessing just how much damage we've got, and it may be some time before we've got an accurate count,'' said Paul Bettencourt, the Harris County tax assessor who estimated that 10,000 homes had been damaged. ''Many areas are still flooded and we haven't been able to get into them yet.'' At the world's largest medical facility, the Texas Medical Center near downtown -- a complex of more than a dozen hospitals and research laboratories -- dozens of volunteers worked furiously today to unload crates of dry ice to cool laboratory specimens put at risk by power failures over the weekend. Claire Bassett, a vice president at the Baylor College of Medicine, said thousands of laboratory animals, mainly rats and mice, had been killed when storm waters flooded their facilities overnight Friday. ''We won't know just how bad the loss is until we can get in there, but we're estimating the losses of lab animals throughout the Texas Medical Center at several thousand,'' Ms. Bassett said. But worse, she said, was the loss of scientific research and specimens flooded or destroyed when the power failed. One of those most affected by the loss was Dr. Bonnie Dunbar, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at the college, who said she lost more than 20 years worth of laboratory specimens and clones. ''It's all gone, more than 20 years of work, and there are hundreds of other like me,'' Dr. Dunbar said. ''We've lost meticulous research, doctoral theses, experiment records, biological samples, all gone.'' Dr. Dunbar, who was to have left for Kenya on Monday as part of a Fulbright scholarship program to perform pediatric H.I.V. research in Africa, has also been displaced from her home: the rains knocked out power and telephones in her 40-story apartment building, and she has been forced to move. In the hard-hit northeastern part of the city, more than 3,300 people took refuge on Saturday night in the Lakewood Church, which eventually became the largest refugee center of more than 30 across the city. ''People just started coming and kept on coming because they had no place else to go,'' the church's pastor, the Rev. Joel Osteen, said. ''Eventually, city workers started dropping people off here in dump trucks because they were the only vehicles that could get through the water.'' Short of food by Saturday morning, Mr. Osteen recruited two brothers- in-law with Chevy Suburbans and a family friend for a visit to Sam's Discount Club, where they spent $3,000 on ingredients for sandwiches. ''Every time we returned with a load of food, the crowd of people would have gotten larger and we'd have to go make another trip,'' he said. But by today, the local news media had reported about food shortages at the church, and area residents bearing food, diapers, clothing and bottled water created a traffic jam in the streets outside the church. Signs of the flooding were apparent in the neighborhoods of the Lakewood area, with soaked carpets, furniture and clothing strewn in dozens of muddy yards. In addition to the staggering job of cleaning up after the flood, there was also the burden of mourning, as details of the deaths the city sustained over the weekend emerged. One couple, walking along the banks of White Oak Bayou, were swept away by a rapidly rising torrent, their bodies later found in the branches of nearby trees. A man trying to save a television set was electrocuted when he reached for its antenna; his mother also was electrocuted as she tried to help him. At least five drivers died after being caught by high water in their vehicles. But one of the most shocking accounts was the death of Kristie Lee Tautenhahn, 42, a clerk at a downtown law firm. Warned that vehicles in the Bank of America building's underground garage should be moved to higher ground, she took an elevator down to get her car from the fourth level of the garage early Saturday morning. At the third level, water flooded into the elevator, shutting off power, and Ms. Tautenhahn drowned there, alone. ''To die in an elevator is just tragic,'' John Tautenhahn, her cousin, told The Houston Chronicle. ''This is just devastating.'' Much of downtown remained crippled today, without power or working telephones. Parts of the dozen miles of tunnels beneath the city, built to help downtown office workers escape the summer heat and filled with food courts and stores, were flooded. At the Harris County Jail, which is adjacent to Buffalo Bayou, 3,000 inmates had to be moved to other facilities when the floods knocked out electricity and water. Continental Airlines, based in Houston, resumed flights today after canceling more than 1,000 flights on Saturday. And all across the city, as the sun finally poked through still-cloudy skies, residents shared stories of what they are calling the ''Great Flood of 2001.'' Jennifer Brazzel, an artist and interior designer, was stranded when she tried to drive her Toyota 4-Runner five miles to a friend's house on Friday night. Her car flooded just off Rice University's campus and a block from the Rice Village Shopping Center. ''I was trying to drive to my friend's house and all of a sudden Rice Boulevard was like a river,'' Ms. Brazzel said. ''Water was over my dash.'' Ms. Brazzel managed to get the car door open, and fought her way to higher ground, although the current knocked her down several times along the way. The sun had risen before she got home. Linda Gomez's husband was moving cars to higher ground when Ms. Gomez heard a noise in the backyard and saw water bursting from a manhole cover. When she went to investigate in the dark, she slipped into the hole. The water was only a foot deep but the lid was stuck and the current was strong. She was treated for bruises and scrapes at a hospital on Friday. ''When I got home the water was starting to rise,'' she said. She disconnected electrical appliances and began to move furniture higher, but by 10:30 that night the water had started coming into the house. ''By then it was too late,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''The water came into the house so fast. We were trying to get things up. There was no way to get out.'' As the water continued to rise in the one-story house, to an eventual height of almost five feet, they moved to the attic. ''Neighbors were screaming on both sides,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''The homeless men who sleep in the park across the street were screaming for help. I told my husband we have to figure out a way to make a hole in the roof.'' She eventually reached her son, who works with the Sheriff's Department, by cell phone. ''I told him I don't think we'll make it out of here,'' Ms. Gomez said. About 8 a.m. Saturday, a Houston Fire Department boat evacuated Ms. Gomez and her family. Today, they returned to find their home filled with mud and debris. As she surveyed the damage, Ms. Gomez said: ''I was raised in this house. I'm 54 years old. And I've never seen anything like this.''"
"As Houston began to dry out, the drenched residents of southern Louisiana continued to sandbag and pray today, hoping that the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison would not linger in a region that has already been deluged by five days of heavy rainfall and spot flooding. Twenty parishes, or counties, in Louisiana's bayou country have received declarations of emergency from the state government, and another two are likely to do so on Monday. With rain still falling along much of the coast, up to several inches today in some areas, flood watches were expected to remain in effect through the night, a National Weather Service spokesman said. As the storm system moved slowly eastward, rainfall was heavy today in the areas along Atchafalaya Bay and Vermilion Bay, leaving localized but heavy flooding in some places. Forecasters said they expected some rain to continue through Tuesday, and that additional flooding could occur depending on the amount and location of the rainfall. Baton Rouge, for instance, has been soaked with more than 20 inches of rain since last Tuesday. Thousands of homes and other structures have been damaged by flooding, and storm-weary homeowners have had to evacuate their houses, sometimes in flat-bottom boats. In Iberville Parish, near St. Gabriel, some 300 inmates of the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center were released from their cells to help fill and stack the sandbags that the authorities hope will protect the prison from the rising waters of Bayou Manchac and its tributaries. Their work was slowed today by the deterioration of a gravel road, which made it difficult to move heavy trucks laden with sand into the area. ''If they lose that wall, the prison's going to go under at least a couple of feet, and then we'll have to evacuate the prisoners to a safe place,'' said Terry Thompson, operations manager of Louisiana's Office of Emergency Preparedness. ''They've filled and stacked 200,000 sandbags in the last two days, working around the clock. They're making huge strides.'' S. H. Jackson, the emergency preparedness director in Iberville Parish, estimated that rescuers would have 12 to 18 hours to move 3,000 inmates and 1,200 residents from the area if the sandbagging effort failed. At the moment, he said, workers were fighting the water to a draw. ''As fast as we run out a row of sandbags, the water pretty much catches up to where we are,'' Mr. Jackson said. New Orleans, by far the largest population center along the Louisiana coast, had not been significantly affected this evening, said Rhonda Spears, a spokeswoman for Mayor Marc A. Morial. The city has seen some minor street flooding, particularly last Thursday, but has not faced the kinds of accumulations found to the west. ''We're in a wait-and-see position,'' Ms. Spears said, adding that the city's emergency operations center was open. ''Our concern is what the weather's going to be like overnight and how it will affect traffic in the morning.'' The Mississippi coast also had yet to feel any heavy impact from the storm, other than some minor street flooding in low-lying areas, said Amy Bissell, a spokeswoman for the state Emergency Management Agency. ''We're ready for anything that comes, but hopefully we won't have to face any worse weather,'' she said. In the central and western coastal parishes of Louisiana, however, residents have been fighting the water for days. There have been few injuries, though one man died when his vehicle was struck by a falling tree earlier in the week. But a number of rivers and bayous have escaped their banks and levees, flooding roads and neighborhoods under as much as four feet of water. Thousands of families have evacuated their homes, most on their own but some with the help of law enforcement officials and the National Guard. In East Baton Rouge Parish, which includes the state capital, at least 1,800 people have left their houses, with about 250 needing assistance from the authorities, said Barry G. Mounce, a spokesman for the Baton Rouge Fire Department. ''Several of the neighborhoods are completely underwater,'' Mr. Mounce said. ''There's no way of having access unless you have a small boat.'' Sheriff's deputies have blocked about 100 roads, fearing that even the slight wake caused by a passing boat or car could cause more houses to flood. One major river in the area, the Amite, has not crested. But Mr. Mounce said he was hopeful that the worst was over. ''Unless we get an inordinate amount of rain tonight and tomorrow, we hope the rivers will start subsiding tomorrow,'' he said. With waterways filled and the soil utterly saturated, there simply has been no place for the water to go, and much of the flooding has been caused by washes of backwater. Residents fear that when the water finally does subside, they may find that large numbers of alligators have been washed out of the bayous and into the neighborhoods. ''When it dries out in a day or two,'' said Michael J. Deroche, director of emergency preparedness for Terrebonne Parish, ''we'll find them all over the place.''"
"Tropical Storm Barry, nearing wind speeds that almost made it the season's first hurricane, aimed toward the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama today, carrying the threat of torrential rains and weeks of flooding. This evening, the storm was spinning at about 70 miles per hour in the Gulf of Mexico, about 45 miles from the barrier-island town Fort Walton Beach, Fla. The National Hurricane Center said there was only a slight chance that it would reach hurricane speeds of 74 m.p.h. by landfall, expected before dawn on Monday. Hurricane center officials said the storm could drop 8 to 10 inches of rain on the panhandle, southern Alabama and Georgia. High waves and a storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were also forecast for the Florida coast. Emergency management officials and coastal residents took moderate precautions, although several said they tended not to get too worried when an approaching storm failed to exceed 70 m.p.h. ''This isn't that big a deal yet,'' said Curtis Bosarge, who owns a vacation home in Gulf Shores, Ala. ''Of course, that could change at any minute, but I'm sticking it out.'' Michael Hardin, chief of the emergency management division of Escambia County, Fla., which includes Pensacola, said the county had not ordered any evacuations of coastal areas but had opened three shelters farther inland. Only a few people were in the shelters this evening, Mr. Hardin said. He said coastal authorities were as worried about the heavy rain bands visible in radar snapshots of the storm as they were about high winds. Forecasters said the storm could stall over southern Alabama or Georgia and produce heavy rains for two or three days, Mr. Hardin said, which would probably produce flooding along the coast for a week or so. Bill Frederick, a meteorologist with the hurricane center, said Barry was unlikely to exceed 70 m.p.h. and would probably drop to 30 to 50 m.p.h. by the time it crossed the coast. The rain will probably become the storm's biggest threat, he said, and not just along the coast. The remnants of the storm could also cause flooding as far north as Arkansas in the next two weeks. A weather system in the central plains will keep the storm from moving north and dissipating, forcing it to spend enough time raining on the south-central Mississippi Valley to produce what the center called a ''serious inland flooding event.'' The last hurricane in the area was Georges in 1998, which left behind 18 inches of rain in the Pensacola area and causing serious flooding. Farther east, near Panama City, Fla., the authorities in Franklin County ordered the evacuation of several thousand residents on three barrier islands. ''Even if it doesn't become a hurricane, we can lose parts of the causeway and the roads that we need to evacuate these islands,'' said Tim Turner, emergency management director for Franklin County. ''Once we get to 40 m.p.h., we have to close the bridges, because they're unsafe to drive on. So we thought it would be better to get people out of there. It's always a judgment call.'' Mr. Turner added that one tornado had touched down in the area and that the rainfall could become quite serious. After taking its unexpected turn eastward, the storm spared New Orleans and much of the Mississippi coast. This afternoon was mostly bright and windy around Mobile. But beaches were closed because of strong riptides caused by the storm, and there were reports of waves as high as eight feet. Several regional airports also planned to shut down tonight, and the Air Force flew about 300 of its personnel from Fort Walton Beach to Little Rock, Ark., on 40 cargo aircraft to move them from the storm's path. Tropical Storm Barry is the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. In June, Tropical Storm Allison dumped 20 inches of rain in Louisiana and 32 inches in Texas, much of it as the storm sat for days off the coast, then causing floods as far north as Pennsylvania."
"Having threatened Florida with high winds for three days, Tropical Storm Barry proved to be little more than a heavy downpour as it crossed the Panhandle this morning, soaking large parts of the Southeast but doing little damage. Forecasters warned, however, that the storm -- now downgraded to a tropical depression -- still had the potential to inflict serious flooding if it stalled over Arkansas or Mississippi later in the week and continued its rainfall. ''Right now, it looks like things will be O.K. as long as it keeps moving pretty quickly,'' said James Franklin, a hurricane specialist in the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''But if it slows down in the next day or so, the threat of flooding will increase.'' At its peak on Sunday, the storm almost became the season's first hurricane, reaching sustained winds of 70 miles per hour, just short of the hurricane level of 74 m.p.h. But as a sign of its diminished status in the world of weather, the hurricane center handed it off to its sister agency, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center near Washington, which deals with more mundane events like thunderstorms and blizzards. The hurricane specialists wanted nothing more to do with the storm after its winds dropped to an embarrassing 30 m.p.h. ''That's H.P.C.'s storm now,'' Mr. Franklin said. Florida residents seemed similarly unimpressed by the storm's bluster. Only a few people had boarded up windows or used an emergency shelter on Sunday night. Though the storm came ashore just east of Destin, Fla., shortly after midnight, that resort town and the nearby barrier-island strip of Fort Walton Beach showed little sign of damage beyond fallen tree limbs and power lines. A few garbage cans were sent reeling, and there was an occasional shower of palm fronds. ''We've had worse storms than this in St. Louis,'' said Shirley Boedeker of Florissant, Mo., who was spending the week in Fort Walton Beach with her husband and grandchildren. Ann Rowe, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said that about 37,000 people lost power in six Panhandle counties, but that there were no reports of injuries. One home was lost in Cape San Blas, and a high-rise condominium building in Destin lost some windows. The agency said the greatest rainfall of the day was some distance away in Tallahassee, where 440 roads were closed and flash flooding was widespread. By midday, the storm, greatly weakened, was over Selma, Ala., and was expected to spend the night in Mississippi, pleasing farmers in the area."
"Restless souls come to this southernmost point in the contiguous United States for a new life in paradise. Their cars, on the other hand, come here to die. For as long as natives can remember, the streets of Key West have been a dumping ground for clunkers that broke down after the trip from distant cities where they had more dignity and purpose. So common are groaning old cars with shocking odometer readings that Key West, a k a the Conch Republic, has a name for them: conch cruisers. ''It happens all the time,'' said Christine Rodriguez, whose salvage yard north of the island does a brisk business crushing abandoned vehicles and selling them as scrap. ''People say, 'Key West or bust,' '' Ms. Rodriguez said, then arrive in a dilapidated car, ''dump it and end up on a sailboat or something.'' Clearing the streets of orphaned cars has long been a challenge for Key West, a 2-by-4-mile island that resents their rusting hulks' marring its winsome streets. But after Hurricane Wilma flooded Key West in October, ruining as many as 7,000 cars in a matter of hours, what had been a low-grade headache became a throbbing migraine. Scores of owners never retrieved their uninsured cars after the storm, leaving them to deteriorate on narrow, busy streets that were already short on parking. More than three months after Hurricane Wilma, about 300 ravaged cars remain on public property, said the Key West police chief, Bill Mauldin. Some have been taken over by homeless people, while others, waterlogged and moldy, are environmental hazards. One was being used as a bathroom, Chief Mauldin said. Local tow companies, which already hated collecting abandoned cars because there is no money in it, resisted pitching in after the city said it could not pay them to do so. ''For salvage yards, it might be a gold mine,'' said Doris Arnold, co-owner of Arnold's Towing Service, which has hauled cars here for 25 years. ''For a towing company, it would break our back.'' Over the city's protests, Arnold's and the three other operators that contract with the city for normal towing -- after accidents, drunken driving arrests and run-of-the-mill illegal parking -- refused to haul the flood-wrecked cars away as part of their regular duties. Most had limited space to store abandoned vehicles, which must be held at least 37 days before disposal. If nobody claims a car during the state-established waiting period, towing companies must try to find the owner and let him know by certified mail that they are going to dispose of it. They also have to inform the public through newspaper advertisements before selling abandoned cars, usually to a scrap yard 160 miles north in Miami. Cecilia Gonzalez, who owns a towing company with her husband, Ray, said she could file a lien against the owners of abandoned cars, who would then not be able to register another vehicle in Florida or get drivers' licenses renewed without paying the towing charges. But many who abandon cars are drifters who drove in from other states and are hard to find through records searches. Many cannot afford the fees anyway. Chief Mauldin said a recent meeting with the city's four contracted tow operators had yielded a potential solution. Mrs. Gonzalez's company, A1A, agreed to tow the remaining abandoned vehicles as long as it had sole responsibility for the job. The company gets $60 to $70 per ton of crushed car, she said. ''We have the means to make it a little profitable,'' said Mrs. Gonzalez, whose company has several acres of storage space and does salvage as well as towing. ''If we can just have the whole volume, we can keep the pace up and help the city.'' Despite the challenges involved in finding many owners, the city is also moving to impose stiff fines on people who desert their cars: $500 plus a storage fee of perhaps $35 a day, Chief Mauldin said. At the Conch Republic Cigar Factory on Greene Street, near the heart of Key West's tourist district, Linda Willoughby was still fuming about the minivan from New Jersey that took up a prime parking spot outside the shop for three months. Constant calls to the city proved fruitless, she said, so last month the shop paid $450 to have the minivan towed. ''I'm mad at the people from New Jersey for leaving their trash on our doorstep,'' said Ms. Willoughby, the store's manager. Elsewhere in Key West, several residents said the situation had improved in recent weeks: eyesore cars were finally disappearing. But some were still in evidence amid the lush foliage, picket fences and pastel-trimmed homes of Old Town. On Emma Street, a Chevrolet Corsica sat with its hood popped and windows gone. On Thomas Street, a Suzuki beach buggy with a Grateful Dead sticker rusted away in the twilight. And on Catherine Street, a BMW took up a parking space for city employees, its interior strewn with sand, trash and stray clothing. A notice on the windshield warned that it would be towed on Dec. 22. ''This is a huge elephant,'' Chief Mauldin said. ''We are going to take one bite at a time of this, and eventually we're going to whittle this thing down.'' Key West Journal"
"Natural disasters leave destruction in their wake, but they can also remove entrenched barriers to change. Hurricane Katrina's devastation of New Orleans has provided a rare opportunity to dissolve the levee boards, which fragment and decentralize storm protection for southern Louisiana, and replace them with one unified board. Taking action on the levee boards would improve storm protection and send Washington a clear signal that the State Legislature is taking reform seriously. The federal government has been waiting for Louisiana to show that it is doing more than just asking for big sums of money. The more rational and organized the response, the more comfortable Congress will feel about spending more money on higher, stronger walls to protect the city. Levee boards should first and foremost prepare for hurricanes, not provide patronage jobs. The Orleans Parish levee board has been roundly criticized for its sprawling interests and holdings, which made it more of a real estate developer than a safety watchdog. Perhaps the most egregious example of that is the $2.5 million the board spent to renovate a fountain before the storms hit. This week the State Legislature convened its second special session on Hurricane Katrina. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and the Legislature had a chance to reform the system at the special session in November, but the governor backed a weaker oversight measure that failed to pass. That cannot happen again. This time they must overcome rivalries for the greater good. Storms do not pay attention to parish lines, and neither should the system to defend against them. While much of the blame for the failures of the defense system falls at the feet of the Army Corps of Engineers, Louisiana should focus on what it can do to improve organization and accountability on its end. It is startling how little urgency remains in the nation's capital to rebuild the Gulf Coast. President Bush barely found time in his State of the Union address to mention the devastation and, more important, put no additional reconstruction funds in his recently released budget for the next fiscal year. As Ms. Blanco told the Legislature on Monday, ''We had all better put Louisiana politics aside and worry about Washington politics, or our people and our state will lose.'' Congress is more inclined to help those who show they can help themselves. Fixing the levee boards would send that message. Editorial"
"When a big contracting company hired him to clean up this small town northwest of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, Matthew Lopez saw it as a way to help his neighbors and to make decent money: $9 for every cubic yard of hurricane debris he delivered to a dump. But as soon as he started clearing downed branches, there was a problem: out-of-town contractors that also worked for the larger company were sneaking into his territory and snatching up the loose debris. ''You'd push up a pile with a Bobcat, turn your back, and their truck would be right there,'' he said. That left him and his small crew to do the hard, not very lucrative work of cutting up big trees with chain saws. So Mr. Lopez did what a lot of small contractors here say they are trying to do: he found a lawyer and sued the big company that had hired him for breach of contract, saying it favored his out-of-town rivals and had let them steal his work. The case is just one of dozens of courthouse disputes and public controversies that have erupted over the still-gargantuan task of removing tons of debris in Louisiana and Mississippi, almost six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Government officials, contractors and workers all describe a complicated and bureaucratic process that wastes money, slows the cleanup and fails to ensure that the economic benefits of the work go to the people who need them most, the residents of the disaster areas. Indeed, the problems are now so clear that even the Department of Homeland Security and its Congressional critics have decided that the entire process for cleaning up after storms -- and paying for the cleanups -- needs to be restructured. Among the many problems that have plagued the $1.3 billion cleanup program are these: Contractors and workers, ranging from individual laborers to a quality-control consulting firm, contend that they have been abused, underpaid or not paid at all. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which recently filed a federal lawsuit in New Orleans accusing two private cleanup companies of shortchanging hundreds of immigrant laborers, says the federal government is turning a blind eye to violations of labor law. Many local government officials complain about the slow pace of the cleanup, which federal officials concede is only half done in Louisiana. Local politicians are also fuming over their lack of control over what happens in their communities. Congressional leaders from Mississippi say that one large and politically connected debris-removal company, AshBritt Inc. of Pompano Beach, Fla., is trying to thwart a plan to give work to small companies in their state. The company says it is the victim of a politically motivated effort to take away its business. Louisiana contractors are so angry about the small quantity and low quality of the work they are getting that their trade organization is asking the state to take over federal debris-removal contracts being handled by the Army Corps of Engineers. Local people say that armies of middlemen do no work but siphon off money, while some big companies contend that they have been forced to hire contractors on the basis of their political connections. Meanwhile, government investigators have opened at least five inquiries into debris removal, and federal prosecutors have filed two criminal complaints involving it. Officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, which handle much of the contracting for debris removal, say the agencies are satisfied with the cleanup's pace, given the magnitude of the task. They note that Hurricane Katrina created twice as much debris as the four 2004 hurricanes in Florida combined. In Louisiana, of an estimated 60 million cubic yards of debris, about 32.7 million cubic yards of debris were picked up by early February, 18 million of them by contractors hired by the corps, according to FEMA data. In Mississippi, where local governments have been more prone to undertake their own removal, almost 32 million cubic yards out of 43 million have been removed. The corps says it has spent about $1.3 billion so far, and FEMA is spending hundreds of millions of dollars more reimbursing local governments for the debris removal for which they contract directly. But some outside experts agree with the local complaint that the pace has been far too slow. ''I've been shocked,'' said Jane A. Bullock, a former senior official with FEMA who is now a consultant and a professor at George Washington University. ''The recovery is going every bit as badly as the response did.'' [Last week, Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, acknowledged that debris removal remained a problem. He vowed to Congress to improve the system by, among other things, ''cutting out middle-men and ensuring that states are quickly and cost-effectively supported by qualified local debris removal firms.''] Before Hurricane Katrina, the Army Corps of Engineers, which handles federal debris removal programs on FEMA's behalf, had a standing contract with AshBritt to clean up after emergencies in Louisiana and Mississippi. But in early September, facing the hurricane's enormous destruction, the corps opened the job to competitive bidding and awarded $500 million contracts to four big out-of-state companies. AshBritt was given Mississippi; Ceres Environmental Services of Brooklyn Park, Minn., was assigned Louisiana cleanup north of New Orleans; and the Environmental Chemical Corporation of Burlingame, Calif., and Phillips & Jordan of Nashville were given contracts to work in and around New Orleans. Local governments were also allowed to hire their own debris-removal companies, with the cost to be picked up by FEMA. But many local officials complain they were discouraged from doing so by threats that they would be audited or have to cover some costs themselves. It was in part a desire to get work for local people that prompted St. Bernard Parish, the devastated area east of New Orleans, to insist on hiring its own contractor, officials there say. But five months after basically every building in the parish was flooded, FEMA has yet to reimburse the government or its contractor for debris removal costs, which the public works department says have reached $50 million. Local officials say they are being punished. ''This is blackmail; you can't tell me it's not,'' said Henry Rodriguez, the parish president. ''They're trying to put our contractor out of business, to prove that you have to use the Corps.'' St. Bernard may borrow money to pay part of the bill, he said recently, adding, ''FEMA will cause the parish to go bankrupt in six months or a year.'' The Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness and Homeland Security, which is an intermediary between local governments and FEMA, said the federal agency contends that the parish was paying its contractor too much, particularly for demolition, according to an e-mail message from Mark C. Smith, the state agency's spokesman. This argument infuriates Clyde P. Martin, Jr., who until he resigned on Feb. 10 was St. Bernard's director of public works. FEMA will not tell the parish what prices it considers reasonable, he said. And despite the best efforts of his staff, he said, they cannot find out what the Corps is paying in New Orleans, which had similar damage. The Corps has refused to release many details of its contracts, including how much it is paying its main contractors, who say they cannot give out information without the Corps' permission. The debate over using local businesses may be even more intense in Mississippi as a result of the Corps's decision in September to award the $500 million Mississippi contract to AshBritt of Florida. Members of Congress from both parties demanded to know why the work had not gone to a local company, which they said was required by federal law. In December, the Corps responded by seeking a new $300 million contract with an unprecedented twist: only Mississippi companies would be allowed to bid. Up to $150 million would be reserved for small or minority-owned businesses. That angered Mr. Perkins, AshBritt's owner, who said the new contract would not benefit small companies, which he said were already getting more than 70 percent of money his company spent in Mississippi. ''I understand the political side that takes place probably better than any businessman in this business,'' said Mr. Perkins, a major donor to the Republican Party who is known for aggressive lobbying. (He has hired, among others, the firm founded by Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi.) AshBritt has filed formal contract protests, prompting bipartisan criticism from Congressional leaders. ''After all that has happened to the Gulf Coast, I find it appalling that any company would resort to legal maneuverings to make a few dollars off of Mississippi's pain,'' Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement. But Mr. Perkins remains defiant. ''I'm way out on the end of a plank here with sharks circling around,'' he said, explaining his decision to file a protest to the new contract. ''But I don't have a choice. They are taking my business away.'' That is precisely the feeling expressed on a much smaller scale by Mr. Lopez, the dump truck owner, whose lawsuit against Ceres Environmental has been moved to Federal District Court in New Orleans. Ceres has asked the court to dismiss the case or require it to go to arbitration or mediation. ''Lopez seeks payment for work he was not promised, work he did not perform, and indeed, work he was not capable of performing,'' the company said in court filings. Mr. Lopez maintains that he was sandbagged by Ceres, and hopes to be paid money he says the company owes him for work he did, as well as some compensation for the work he thinks was stolen by the favored out-of-town crew. His suit seeks information about how much debris was removed and how much subcontractors were paid, said Jed Cain, a lawyer who represents him. Mr. Lopez said he wanted answers to another question about debris removal. ''You wonder,'' he said, ''where the money's going.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE RECOVERY"
"The American Red Cross has dismissed a third volunteer in its widening inquiry into accusations of improprieties involving the relief effort after Hurricane Katrina, and the agency expects to make criminal referrals to the authorities, a Red Cross official said Saturday. The Red Cross acknowledged last week that it was looking into accusations that relief supplies were improperly diverted, that volunteers had failed to follow Red Cross procedures in tracking and distributing supplies, and that felons were used as volunteers in violation of Red Cross rules. Though supervisors said they had no official estimates of the cash or the value of supplies that might have been misappropriated, the volunteers who made the accusations said the amount was in the millions of dollars. Americans donated $3.6 billion for hurricane relief, and 60 percent of that went to the Red Cross, where 95 percent of the personnel, including supervisors, are volunteers. ''Three volunteers have now been relieved of their duties by Red Cross investigators, who determined on scene that allegations of waste and abuse involving those volunteers were substantial enough to warrant their immediate removal,'' Charles Dean Connor, a spokesman for the agency, said on Saturday. ''The Red Cross will spare no effort as it continues its investigation. Criminal referrals to appropriate law enforcement agencies are anticipated.'' Mr. Connor did not identify any of the three dismissed volunteers. But last week, three other volunteers currently involved in relief operations in New Orleans identified one of them as Patrick Keena, the senior official responsible for the agency's food and shelter operations in the disaster area. They said he was fired on Friday. Mr. Keena, who had been affiliated with the Red Cross for 25 years, could not be reached for comment. But he reportedly told volunteers he worked with that he was leaving because of a medical emergency."
"New Orleans's levees do not meet the standards that the Federal Emergency Management Agency requires for its flood protection program, federal officials said yesterday -- and they added that the problem would take as much as $6 billion to fix. FEMA has long based its flood planning on whether an area is protected against a flood that might have a 1 percent chance of occurring in any year, also known as a 100-year flood. Without that certification, the agency's flood maps have to treat the entire levee system as if it were not there at all, which means that people hoping to build in the affected areas might have to rebuild their homes at elevations of 15 or even 30 feet above sea level in order to meet new federal building standards. But since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the agency has toughened its 100-year standard, based on new information about land subsidence and the increasing severity and frequency of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. There is also new data about weak soils in the area and the failure of some of the city's floodwalls. As a result, the levees that the Army Corps of Engineers is now building will not meet the new FEMA standard. Donald Powell, the federal coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding, said Thursday that the Corps now believes it cannot meet that standard without spending additional billions to upgrade the flood protection system still further. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana expressed outrage over what she called a monumental miscalculation and said it was shocking to learn that $6 billion more might be needed for the hurricane protection system. ''This means that, just two months before hurricane season, the Corps of Engineers informs us they cannot ensure even the minimum safety of Southeastern Louisiana,'' Ms. Blanco said in a statement. ''This is totally unacceptable.'' But Mr. Powell said in a news briefing yesterday that the $2 billion that the Army Corps of Engineers is currently spending and the $1.4 billion in additional funds it has requested will make the system stronger and better than it has ever been. Asked if he would feel comfortable living in the area despite the government's inability to certify the levees, he responded, ''after the Corps completes its work, yes.'' Mr. Powell called the difference ''a regulatory issue, not necessarily a safety issue.'' When the current work on the levees is complete, he said, there might be flooding from a storm like Hurricane Katrina, but the levee system would not fail catastrophically again. Although people can rebuild without the federal flood maps today, many homeowners may well decide that the risks of rebuilding are too great. The Louisiana Recovery Authority has said that its plan to provide grants to those who rebuild will favor those who meet FEMA requirements. Mr. Powell said that to start the process of getting the new flood maps, the federal government only needs to state that it does intend to meet the certification standard -- a process that it can undertake for the entire system at the full $6 billion, or pick and choose projects to cut costs. The flood advisory documents, which will begin the process of creating final flood maps, could emerge within days, Mr. Powell said. It will take up to 18 months to complete the maps. In the briefing, Mr. Powell said that rebuilding the city could take 25 years -- a sentiment shared by many disaster recovery experts. He added, however, ''It could be much shorter than that, depending on how they plan their future. I'm going to be doing everything I can to make this as short as possible.'' Matt McBride, a member of the community group in Broadmoor, a New Orleans neighborhood that was inundated during Hurricane Katrina, said many city residents would be disappointed by the levee announcement. While many people in his neighborhood were committed to rebuilding, he said, ''It's just one more headache on top of the hundreds that we're dealing with.''"
"Gliding gracefully half a mile below sea level, two robotic submarines are part of an unusual repair job intended to restore much-needed oil resources to the nation's strained energy network. After two months spent digging and cutting and shuffling heavy equipment by remote control, their job should be done by early March. But the huge task of fixing the country's most important energy hub is far from over. Six months after Hurricane Katrina battered the gulf with 175-mile-an-hour winds and waves higher than eight-story buildings, more than a quarter of the region's oil output is still shut down. The shortages, amounting to 6 percent of the country's domestic production, have worsened a global picture of razor-thin margins of supply, playing a central part in keeping oil prices around $60 a barrel. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged 167 offshore platforms and 183 pipelines, shut down production for weeks and pushed prices to their highest levels since the fall of the shah of Iran led to the oil shock of the early 1980's. Nineteen movable well-drilling rigs snapped from their moorings and drifted, some as far as 60 miles. By contrast, Hurricane Ivan, rated as one of the most severe storms in the gulf when it struck in 2004, destroyed just 7 platforms in shallow waters and damaged another 24 structures and 102 pipelines. ''The storms cut a huge swath over the landscape,'' said Allen J. Verret, the president of the Offshore Operators Committee, an industry group. ''We were still recovering from Hurricane Ivan when the terrible sisters came.'' Now, he said, ''we are all concerned by how long it takes to bring it all back up again.'' Few will openly say so, but oil companies are racing against the clock. In less than four months, the next hurricane season kicks off. Last year's severe storms forced the United States and its allies to release strategic stocks of petroleum held for emergencies like wars or embargoes. More than 20,000 miles of underwater pipelines and 3,000 offshore platforms were in the path of either storm. Today in the gulf's offshore region, 362,000 barrels of oil a day, out of a total of 1.5 million barrels, remain shut off, along with 15 percent of the region's natural gas production, or 1.5 billion cubic feet a day. Restoring production has proved exceptionally arduous because of the storms' impact on communities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Oil companies had to deal with workers who had lost their homes, contractors who had lost their equipment and widespread destruction to the region's basic infrastructure. ''All the components of the production system have to be in place'' before output can be restored, said Melody Meyer, who heads Chevron's production unit in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell, the top oil producer in the gulf, estimated the cost at $250 million to $300 million. The company said that three-quarters of its total capacity of 450,000 barrels a day had been returned to production. But one of its biggest structures, Mars, which produced about 140,000 barrels of oil a day before Hurricane Katrina, is not expected to restart until the second half of 2006. The platform was badly damaged when a drilling rig tumbled over in the storm, shattering equipment, living quarters and the intricate network of electronics and pipes that girdle all platforms. Also, the pair of pipelines that take Mars's oil and natural gas to shore were badly damaged. With no realistic option of towing the platform back to a shipyard, repairs had to be done at sea. Nearly 500 workers have been living in a floating hotel flanking the platform, linked by a pontoon while they complete the tedious job of refitting and rewiring the structure. Other major producers, like BP and Chevron, have similarly suffered. Chevron, which lost a major platform during Hurricane Rita, said that its output was back at two-thirds of its prestorm capacity of 300,000 barrels a day. The company indicated that as much as 20,000 barrels of oil a day would probably never be restored. Over all, it put its bill from the storms at $1.4 billion, a figure that includes the estimated lost production. ''We're scrambling for resources, like everybody else,'' said John R. Sherwood, the chief executive of Anglo-Suisse Offshore Partners, a small oil producer that lost 5 of its 30 shallow-water platforms. ''There's a tremendous strain in the service sector, which was stretched anyway because of the high energy prices and has been magnified by the two storms.'' The industry was already facing a shortage of ships and qualified crews, marine technicians and offshore experts before the hurricanes. Divers to inspect the platforms are especially in demand. Special teams had to be brought from Canada. The work is especially slow when it comes to finding and fixing pipelines in the gulf's shallows, where the water is so opaque that divers have to blindly feel the ground with their hands until they find a missing bit of pipeline. ''It's definitely been nonstop around the clock,'' said Craig Reynolds, managing director of Specialty Diving in Hammond, La. For the first time, he has had to place customers on a waiting list of one to two weeks. The Gulf Coast is by far the most sensitive region for the nation's energy supplies. Refineries in Texas and Louisiana account for nearly half the country's domestic capacity and most of them were affected by the storms. Today, as much as one million barrels a day of capacity, or 6 percent of the nation's total refining capacity, remains shut down. Most of that should be back by the end of March, according to the Energy Department. The recent wave of hurricanes has exposed the country's reliance on the region's fragile infrastructure and raised uncomfortable questions about its reliability as America's most critical domestic energy source. ''We haven't done anything to reduce our vulnerability,'' said Ted M. Falgout, the director of Port Fourchon, the largest servicing hub for the offshore industry, about 80 miles south of New Orleans. ''I hate to think of the next hurricane season.'' The port is a beehive of active cranes, docks and wharfs, with helicopters zooming above, a constant stream of trucks coming in and ships heading out to sea. Everything needed to run an offshore platform, from tissue paper to heavy electric generators, is loaded there. It took port officials three days to clear the waterway after Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Falgout said. While other ports on the coastline were devastated, Port Fourchon managed to resume operations within days. In the weeks after the storm, some oil companies used small tankers and barges to take oil to shore, or redirected flows through undamaged pipelines. Even as they repair the damage, most companies continue to explore the depths of the gulf for new reserves. ''They have every incentive to get things restarted,'' said Chris C. Oynes, the head of the Gulf of Mexico regional office of the Minerals Management Service of the Interior Department. At sea about 45 minutes by helicopter from Port Fourchon, the 318-foot-long Botnica -- which normally does duty as an icebreaker -- is about the last thing you would expect to find in the semitropical gulf waters. While Shell mustered an armada of 24 ships to inspect its equipment in the gulf, it needed a special type of ship, able to stay precisely above a particular spot for weeks on end, while minisubmarines replaced two 85-foot-long sections of pipelines linking Mars to the coast. ''No other vessel was available for the job,'' said Mike Coyne, a senior Shell engineer, who oversees the company's 1,500 miles of pipelines in the gulf. The pipelines, about 100 miles southeast of New Orleans, were crushed when a drilling rig broke free from its moorings during Katrina, dragging along a 12-ton anchor that plowed the sea floor. Shell's engineers had to come up with novel procedures for a job performed beyond diver depth, and rig new tools so they could be powered by the hydraulic system on the minisubs. The work used remotely operated underwater vehicles for the first time in that kind of repair, and involved dozens of engineers onshore, a step-by-step manual thicker than a New York phone book, and minisubs nicknamed Mil-28 and Mag-77. ''It sounds simple but it's actually quite complicated when you have to do it at 3,000 feet below the sea,'' said Frank Glaviano, the head of production for North and South America at Royal Dutch Shell. ''It's never been done before.'' On the control deck, the ship's captain seemed torn about his soon-to-end assignment. ''They would really need us right now in Finland,'' said Leif Kampe, the captain of the Botnica, which usually slices though 30-foot-thick ice at this time of the year. ''But there's more money to be made here.'' And it's warmer. ''It's nice,'' he added, ''being here with the Southern guys.''"
"Raising the specter of a hurricane inundating low-lying sections of the city with a 25-foot storm surge and shattering skyscraper windows into razor-like projectiles, a State Assembly committee yesterday criticized the city's storm evacuation plan. ''The city's plan simply cannot protect life, property and public safety,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions. ''This isn't something that requires tinkering. It just won't work,'' he said of the city's plan, an evolving set of contingencies and procedures that was drafted in the 1990's and has undergone extensive review since Hurricane Katrina last year. The committee's report, which followed six months of hearings and evaluations, said the city had not produced an effective strategy for evacuating sick, elderly and disabled people from nursing homes and hospitals, and had failed to inform the public of the risks of hurricanes. The report also said the city should abandon a strategy, in the event of a major hurricane, of directing people first to ''reception centers'' and then on to shelters. Mr. Brodsky said the system could result in chaos. The hurricane contingency plans are the province of the city's Office of Emergency Management, where a spokesman, Jarrod Bernstein, said the criticism was off base and unfair, because the plans are undergoing extensive revisions. ''The report says last year's milk is sour,'' he said. By July 1, which is generally regarded as the start of hurricane season along the East Coast, the department will release a revised plan, Mr. Bernstein said. He did not dispute the Assembly committee's warnings that the city was overdue for a major hurricane, which, because of New York's geography and density, could be catastrophic. Among the most vulnerable points is the geographical angle at which Long Island juts out, which could intensify the danger to the city from a storm surge, a wall of water that precedes a hurricane. In a Category 3 hurricane like Katrina, the surge in low-lying areas, which range from the Rockaways in Queens to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, could exceed 25 feet, more than double the levels of a similar storm along the Gulf Coast, the Assembly report said. The region's last Category 3 hurricane was in 1938, the report said, and experts have calculated that a storm of that magnitude would occur here about once every 80 years, the report said. ''There is no regular rhythm to hurricanes, but New York is in some sense overdue,'' said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at the Pennsylvania State University, who was asked to respond to the Assembly committee's warnings. Mr. Brodsky, a candidate for attorney general, said the city's hurricane plan was likely to break down because of the two-tier system in which people are first sent to reception centers, which are distributed across the city, before being sent to shelters. He said people would ignore city instructions and go directly to shelters, undermining plans for orderly distribution of emergency beds and supplies. Mr. Bernstein said late yesterday that the city did not plan to eliminate its two-tier contingency plan, but would broaden it to include more reception centers. There are 23 in the current plan, he said, and there will be about 80 when it is revised this year. Mr. Bernstein acknowledged that the city needs to do more in planning for the evacuation or protection of people in hospitals and nursing homes. But he said its options are limited, because there are far too few ambulances in the city to transport every patient on short notice. He said the agency was ''working on striking the right balance'' between planning to call in large numbers of ambulances from elsewhere and planning a phased evacuation system that would start 48 hours before a major storm hits."
"The police arrested a Queens woman yesterday, saying she had falsely claimed to be a victim of Hurricane Katrina and had taken thousands of dollars in aid from state and federal agencies. The woman, Donna Fenton, 37, was charged by Brooklyn prosecutors with several counts of welfare fraud and grand larceny, the latest additions to a long record of fraud, arrests and legal disputes stretching from Mississippi to New York. Ms. Fenton was the subject of an article in The New York Times on March 8, more than a month after Brooklyn prosecutors, prompted by suspicious officials at the city's welfare agency, began investigating her. That article described what Ms. Fenton said were her efforts to re-establish her family in New York after fleeing from Biloxi, Miss., in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In the article, Ms. Fenton, who said she had attended high school in New York, described what she said were her efforts to obtain rent assistance and emergency cash aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, other government agencies and several charities. The article was based on interviews with Ms. Fenton, caseworkers with the Salvation Army, employees of the Ramada Plaza Hotel in Queens, where Ms. Fenton lives, and Amanda McGee, who described herself as the fiancée of Ms. Fenton's oldest son. Ms. Fenton said that she lived at the hotel with her five children, and that her husband had come with her from Biloxi but was living elsewhere in New York. The Times did not verify many aspects of Ms. Fenton's claims, never interviewed her children, and did not confirm the identity of the man she described as her husband. [Editors' Note, Page A2.] Over the last two weeks, prosecutors have shed some light on what they say is the true version of Ms. Fenton's life: She had never lived in Biloxi, and had registered for public assistance at a Brooklyn address last July; none of the four children she claimed as dependents actually live with her; and she was arrested in Queens after trying to cash an expired and altered check, even as she pleaded for more aid from FEMA. On the day Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, they said, someone used Ms. Fenton's New York State welfare benefits card in Brooklyn. Ms. Fenton was formally charged with filing false documentation with the city's welfare agency and illegally obtaining thousands of dollars in benefits from that agency as well as from FEMA. ''She was expert at spinning a web of deceit, layers upon layers, that we've only just begun to untangle,'' said Lauren Mack, chief of the public assistance crimes unit of the Brooklyn district attorney's office. ''It's a shame she's capitalizing on a tragedy that has made so many people homeless and so many people really in need of this aid.'' In an hourlong conversation on Tuesday night, Ms. Fenton insisted that her story was true. She said that she had documents from FEMA verifying her address in Biloxi and that her children were out with her husband but would be back at the hotel, near Shea Stadium, later that night. But after searching her hotel room with a reporter present, she said she could not find the documents. Her husband and children never arrived. A man identifying himself as her common-law husband telephoned the hotel room and said in an interview that the children were with him. Ms. Fenton said she could not provide the names or phone numbers of any friends, family or former co-workers in Biloxi who could verify that she lived there. ''My family has been through enough,'' she said. Officials from the Brooklyn district attorney's office contacted The Times shortly after the article ran to alert the newspaper that Ms. Fenton was under investigation. A subsequent review of public records, interviews with Ms. Fenton's family and associates, and information obtained by prosecutors cast serious doubt on elements of Ms. Fenton's story. Fraud has been a continual headache for FEMA and other government agencies assisting evacuees. A report issued in February by the Government Accountability Office found that many people invented false addresses in the disaster zone to claim FEMA aid. A reporter originally obtained Ms. Fenton's name from the Rev. Donald Hudson, a Queens pastor active in efforts to secure aid for Katrina evacuees in New York. Mr. Hudson had described her as an evacuee who might be willing to be profiled, after the reporter asked him for possible interview subjects. A reporter visited Ms. Fenton on two occasions, in late February and early March, and spent several hours with her, even watching her battle with FEMA officials on the phone. Public records indicate that Ms. Fenton may have used as many as 18 addresses in half a dozen states since 1989, including nearly a dozen in Brooklyn and in Columbus, Miss. She has at least two criminal convictions, for fraud and for grand larceny, and has left behind a trail of creditors and angry landlords. Public records and interviews also indicate that in December 2001, Ms. Fenton was charged with assault, a misdemeanor, in Valley Stream, N.Y., just across the border from Queens in Nassau County. She failed to appear at a 2002 court date, and a bench warrant still exists for her arrest in Nassau County. Also in 2002, apparently while living in Brooklyn, she received a summons in a dispute with a bank over a $7,814 loan. From 2004 until at least the spring of 2005, Ms. Fenton lived in Columbus, Miss., more than 200 miles north of Biloxi. She occupied a succession of homes there, all within a few blocks of one another, each time running into problems with her landlord. One landlord, Biddy Ford, said that Ms. Fenton told her that her husband had left her for another woman. Ms. Ford said she gave Ms. Fenton dishes and other furnishings for the house, and even signed over a check a local church had provided for the house's security deposit so that Ms. Fenton could pay bills. But the relationship soon soured. ''She was my worst nightmare,'' said Ms. Ford. ''She told me she wasn't going to get out and didn't have to leave.'' Ms. Ford took her to court, and a judge quickly granted her request to have Ms. Fenton evicted. A fraud conviction in an unrelated matter, and another dispute with another landlord over unpaid rent, followed, records and interviews show. ''She took absolute advantage of my good heart,'' said the landlord, Frank Webb. Asked on Tuesday about the discrepancies, Ms. Fenton said she had family in Columbus but insisted she had lived in Biloxi for about 18 months. She also suggested that she was a victim of mistaken identity. ''There's another Donna Fenton,'' she said. ''I found that out when I tried to set up an e-mail account.'' Ms. Fenton said she had intended to move back to New York before the hurricane hit, and traveled to Brooklyn last May to apply for a job and for public assistance. Ms. Fenton told a reporter that she had driven with her family to New York City in late September. At a city welcome center, she filled out paperwork with FEMA, other agencies and several charities, claiming to be a Katrina evacuee. The Red Cross, she said, provided her and her family with three rooms at the Ramada. But according to prosecutors, Ms. Fenton's FEMA paperwork listed an address in Biloxi almost identical to the one she had last lived at in Columbus, a city that was damaged far less by the hurricane. A spokesman for the Postal Service, Gerry McKiernan, said the address in question does not exist in Biloxi. Prosecutors also said that the four children Ms. Fenton claimed as dependents had been adopted or were living with foster families. Larry Geiger, a spokesman for the Red Cross of Greater New York, said that the Red Cross had provided Ms. Fenton with help through November, when FEMA took over. He also said that Ms. Fenton's case was under investigation by the Red Cross. Mr. Hudson, whose church assisted Ms. Fenton after she arrived at the Ramada, said he was not aware of her previous record when he referred a reporter to her. ''We deal with everybody as survivors,'' he said. ''Our network doesn't do criminal investigations. If they're here, if they're registered with FEMA, if they've gone through case management, that's how we clear it.'' But Ms. Fenton found herself in trouble with local authorities soon after she arrived at the Ramada. In December, she was arrested in Queens and charged with grand larceny. According to the complaint, Ms. Fenton tried to cash an expired check for $483.26, altered to read $3,483.26, at a check-cashing business near the hotel. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years probation. During the proceedings, she claimed that she was a Katrina evacuee, according to a spokesman for the Queens district attorney. Last winter, a Human Resources Administration employee at a Brooklyn welfare center became suspicious of Ms. Fenton and alerted her supervisors. Agency officials conducted an internal investigation, then referred the case to the district attorney's office in early February. Ms. Fenton was arrested early yesterday at the Ramada. She pleaded not guilty at her arraignment in Brooklyn. Editors' Note: March 23, 2006, Thursday An article in The Metro Section on March 8 profiled Donna Fenton, identifying her as a 37-year-old victim of Hurricane Katrina who had fled Biloxi, Miss., and who was frustrated in efforts to get federal aid as she and her children remained as emergency residents of a hotel in Queens. Yesterday, the New York police arrested Ms. Fenton, charging her with several counts of welfare fraud and grand larceny. Prosecutors in Brooklyn say she was not a Katrina victim, never lived in Biloxi and had improperly received thousands of dollars in government aid. Ms. Fenton has pleaded not guilty. For its profile, The Times did not conduct adequate interviews or public record checks to verify Ms. Fenton's account, including her claim that she had lived in Biloxi. Such checks would have uncovered a fraud conviction and raised serious questions about the truthfulness of her account. An article about her arrest and the findings from additional reporting about her claims appears today on Page B1."
"They are monumental things, these structures, as tall as four-story buildings and as brutal as bad public art. Each of them slightly resembles a giant's chair with massive steel lattices of pipe braced and welded every which way. But they may save central New Orleans from the next hurricane. The Army Corps of Engineers is now unveiling the 45-foot-tall frameworks that, mounted with gates, will soon be placed side by side near the mouth of the 17th Street Canal to prevent a storm from once again sending Lake Pontchartrain into New Orleans. Once the structures are in place, their steel gates, which will normally be raised, can be lowered and locked down before major storms to provide protection against a surge like the one that caused the canal's levees to fail during Hurricane Katrina. When the gates are closed, the lake's waters will not be able to rise against the canal's fragile walls. The gates will be placed not only at the 17th Street Canal but also at the city's two other drainage canals along Lake Pontchartrain. The project will cost nearly $100 million and is the most telling admission by the corps that the old floodwall structure, built in the 1990's, cannot be trusted to protect New Orleans. The enormous size of the gates is exactly what many residents say they need to see, to give them the reassurance necessary to rebuild. ''They want to come out here and see these monster gates before they feel any confidence,'' said Tony Montalbano, the owner of II Tony's restaurant, which sits near the mouth of the 17th Street Canal. In a sense, the gates are a product of almost primitive engineering, movable walls to keep water at bay. The technology, really oversized sluice gates, dates from Roman times. The simplicity was born of a need for speed, said Col. Lewis F. Setliff III, commander of the corps's efforts to rebuild the area's battered hurricane protection system. The corps, Colonel Setliff said, is using ''good, proven engineering that we could put in place by June 1,'' when the hurricane season formally begins. ''We didn't buy all the bells and whistles,'' he said. At first, there will not even be a hydraulic system to lower and raise the gates; instead, the gates at each canal will be lowered by a crane when major storms are forecast. When the gates are down, pumps will push rainwater back out into Lake Pontchartrain. But only half the new pumps for each canal will be in place by June 1, which will make it possible to pump only about 1,000 cubic feet of water every second, roughly one-tenth the full capacity of the old pumping stations. That could mean that the streets in nearby neighborhoods will flood during a storm. Still, such flooding would be far less damaging than the devastation that another breach would cause. ''We're up against the laws of physics and how many pumps can be built in a certain amount of time,'' said Colonel Setliff, who pledged, ''We'll keep making it better.'' Getting the structures in place so quickly requires round-the-clock work and innovative construction strategies borrowed from the offshore oil industry. Because working in water can lead to delays, they are being built not on site but rather on dry land east of central New Orleans along the Intracoastal Waterway, at the construction yard of Boh Brothers, a major local contractor. When a gate is open, the top of it will sit 34 feet above the surface of the water, and will be held in place with enormous pins. When a gate is closed, the bottom will fit into a U-shaped steel groove set in the reinforced concrete base of a retaining structure. Colonel Setliff said that even though the gates would be ready in time for hurricane season, he hoped they would not have to be used. The surge conditions that will require the gates to be closed have occurred fewer than half a dozen times in the last 70 years, he said, adding, ''We may never have to shut them.'' On the other hand, there is also no guarantee that the next hurricane will have the same effect on the canals that the corps is working on; a storm on a different path might have a greater effect on the Mississippi River, for example. For all of the money and sweat that will go into building the gates, the corps plans to replace each of them in a few years with permanent pumping stations that will block surges while matching the pumping power of the old stations. In that project, the interim gates will be removed and the stations will be placed across each canal. The cost is expected to be $573 million, greater than the corps's entire budget for the New Orleans district last year, said James St. Germain, manager of the pumping project. The corps first proposed building canal gates 20 years ago but could not overcome local concerns about possible failure of the gate mechanism. Even now, some people who live in the neighborhood of the 17th Street Canal have aesthetic objections to the gates, said another corps manager, Fred Young. Mr. Young said he had been amazed at community meetings to hear people complain about what the gates would do to their view. But after Hurricane Katrina, the project now has generally broad support. Over lunch at Russell's Marina Grill near the lake, Ernie Taylor, a 69-year-old retired worker at the Michoud Assembly Facility, where the space shuttle's external fuel tank is built, scoffed at the idea that the gates might end up being unattractive. ''So what if it's big and ugly?'' Mr. Taylor said. ''I don't like the way my doggone life jacket fits, but it works. It saved me.'' Mr. Montalbano, the owner of II Tony's, said nothing less would bring residents back to rebuild their homes. Until he sees a system that will prevent breaches and heavy flooding, he said, ''I'm sitting on my hands.'' For now, his home is a trailer next to the restaurant. He says he and many of his neighbors share what he calls an ''I'll believe it when I see it'' attitude about the new efforts to protect his hometown. ''We need to see some hurricanes come through,'' he said. ''Some bad weather -- and some biiiig floodgates.''"
"Federal and state emergency officials promised a different approach on Tuesday to the coming hurricane season, saying they would no longer use ''last resort'' shelters like the Superdome to house displaced residents. Instead, they said, they will put into effect a better system of communication and evacuation to get residents away from the path of a storm. ''Our goal is to create an environment for all of the individuals to leave in the face of a storm rather than stay,'' said Terry Ebbert, the homeland security adviser for Orleans Parish, speaking at a news conference with federal officials regarding preparations for the 2006 season, which begins June 1. To relocate a large number of people efficiently, Mr. Ebbert said, officials are planning an improved public education campaign, and are exploring new ways to use buses, trains, airlines and other evacuation routes. Those plans, however, are still in the conceptual stages and will probably not be ready until closer to the hurricane season, he said. R. David Paulison, acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the new plans were a direct result of lessons learned from last year's disastrous Gulf Coast hurricanes. By retooling the agency and bringing in emergency resources before they are needed -- supplies are being stockpiled at various locations off the Gulf of Mexico -- the federal government will not repeat its mistakes, he vowed. ''We have a different situation now,'' Mr. Paulison said. While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will not issue its official forecast for the new season until May, William Gray, a hurricane expert with Colorado State University, is predicting a tumultuous six months, although the season is not likely to rival last year's devastation. In his December outlook report, Mr. Gray predicted there would be 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes and 5 major events with winds exceeding 111 miles per hour. Aside from these threatening conditions, moving people out of hurricane-prone areas will be more challenging than ever, Mr. Paulison said, because there are now more than 94,000 trailers housing evacuees in the Gulf Coast region alone that are largely unable to stand up to severe winds. People living in trailers will face a mandatory evacuation even for something as small as a tropical storm, he said. Henry Rodriguez, president of St. Bernard Parish, a swampy area just east of New Orleans that was virtually destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, said he would wait to see the actual response before he started cheering the federal government, but expressed confidence that preparations would be improved over all. He added that he hoped that preparedness for this year would not overshadow relief from the hurricanes that had already left their mark on the Gulf Coast. ''I hope that they have learned their lesson by now,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''I hope they know that everyone is depending on them. They needed better planning, and it sounds like we're getting that. I just hope their response is better than their efforts at recovery, though. There has been no progress there -- only progressively worse.''"
"The Swamp The Everglades, Florida and the Politics of Paradise By Michael Grunwald Illustrated. 450 pages. Simon & Schuster. $27. For at least a century and a half, the Everglades wrestled with an image problem. Today, looking at its endless acres of swaying sawgrass, Americans see precious wetlands, home to the egret and the orchid. But for earlier generations, the Everglades was simply a swamp, a mosquito-infested wasteland. ''The first and most abiding impression is the utter worthlessness to civilized man, in its present condition, of the entire region,'' wrote Buckingham Smith, a Harvard-educated lawyer and historian sent by the government to study the Everglades in the 1840's. Drain it, settle it and put it to productive use. That was the mission, pursued zealously by wave after wave of engineers, politicians, real estate sharks, simple farmers and sun chasers from the North and Midwest. Their quest, fueled by ignorance and greed, transformed one the country's great natural wonders into an ecological disaster area, or to adopt the persuasive metaphor proposed by Michael Grunwald in ''The Swamp,'' a desperately sick patient. There is still movement in the limbs, and a faint touch of color in the cheeks. After an almost fatal delay, doctors have arrived on the scene. But the vital signs are weak. The Everglades may not make it. Mr. Grunwald, a reporter for The Washington Post, tells three intertwined stories in ''The Swamp.'' Beginning at the beginning, he describes the creation of the Everglades, the unique ''river of grass'' whose exotic wildlife and vegetation held naturalists like John James Audubon spellbound, and traces the ill-advised efforts to tame it. His second theme is politics and power, the high-stakes battles over the Everglades waged by environmentalists, developers, sugar barons and politicians. Finally, there is ''the swamp'' itself, whose intricate, far-flung ecological system Mr. Grunwald evokes in loving detail, from the twists and turns of the Kissimmee River to the shores of Lake Okeechobee to the herons, mangroves and purple gallinutes of the Glades. He even finds imaginative space for periphyton, the ''golden-brown Everglades goop'' that clumps around aquatic plants ''like slimy oatmeal sweaters,'' providing nutrition for small fish, prawns, insects and snails. The Everglades, Mr. Grunwald writes, was always too subtle to command love and respect, ''less ooh or aah than hmm.'' In his hands, the ooh and aah come to life. ''The Swamp'' abounds in rascals, visionaries and visionary rascals. One of Mr. Grunwald's virtues is his clear-eyed refusal to impose present-day standards on past behavior. The can-do engineers and ruthless tycoons who looked at Florida's squishy, malarial landscape and saw paradise in the making usually thought they were rendering a service to mankind. The most enlightened minds of the Progressive era believed in a ''wise use'' policy toward nature. The land and its gifts were there to be managed and turned to profitable account, and that's exactly what the early would-be conquerors of the Everglades intended to do. ''The Everglades of Florida should be saved,'' Napoleon Bonaparte Broward announced after being elected governor in 1904. ''They should be drained and made fit for cultivation.'' Mr. Grunwald, a terrific writer, moves along at a cracking pace. The dredges dig, the railroad advances, the politicians scheme and the dreamers paint their Technicolor fantasies. There is a feverish quality to the endless engineering assaults, the mad plans to rechannel the circulatory system of the Everglades, the blind determination to ignore the forces of nature. For example, no one quite understood that South Florida often experienced powerful hurricanes, so hundreds of poor farmers died in 1926 and 1927 when Lake Okeechobee overflowed. The wildlife seemed like an inexhaustible resource, so when the fashion in women's hats demanded feathers, plume hunters went on a rampage, killing spoonbills, great white herons, snowy egrets and flamingos. An estimated five million birds were slaughtered in 1886 alone. A birdwatcher strolling along the Ladies' Mile in Manhattan saw feathers from 160 species in the store windows. Some hats supported entire birds. Belatedly, Florida imposed a plume ban, and in 1903 Teddy Roosevelt created a five-acre bird sanctuary on Pelican Island. Again and again, wanton destruction led to horrified realization, followed by remorse and pledges to repair the damage, or the creation of parks, most notably the Everglades National Park in 1947. But year after year, acre by acre, the Everglades shrank. The Army Corps of Engineers continued to see flood control and economic development as its primary mission, not protection of the ecosystem. ''The Swamp'' turns a corner in the early 1970's, when the heroic era of digging and planting and damming comes to an end. The last third of the book deals increasingly with intricate political and economic maneuvering over the Everglades. Nowadays, all politicians want to be seen as friends of the Glades. Rock-ribbed conservatives have found common cause with conservationist firebrands. Conversely, in the last presidential election, friends of the earth lined up against the ecologically sensitive Al Gore when he refused to take a stand against a proposed airport in Homestead, on the Everglades' fringes. Elections, Mr. Grunwald points out, tend to be very good for the Everglades. In 2000, the $8 billion Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was making its way through Congress. It passed because E. Clay Shaw Jr., the 10-term Republican congressman from Fort Lauderdale, found himself in a tight race, and the Republicans held a razor-thin majority in the House. The speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, threw his full weight behind the plan. ''We knew this could come down to two seats, and if that meant we had to spend $8 billion for Mr. Shaw, that's what we were going to do,'' an aide to Mr. Hastert recalled. ''The Swamp'' ends on an uncertain note. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan passed, but its goals seem ambiguous. Half the original Everglades has disappeared, the remainder is slowly dying and the pressures of population growth and development in Florida continue unabated. (The sugar fields may one day give way to something even worse: condominiums.) Good intentions, and lots of government money, may not be enough. In the future there may be no ooh, no aah, not even hmm. BOOKS OF THE TIMES"
"Before Aug. 29, my Creole mother, Ivory, six siblings and 13 nieces and nephews lived in my hometown, New Orleans. Today I have two brothers left in all of Louisiana. In New York, where I live, I've been homesick down to my gut and susceptible to every feeling of helplessness. So when I heard about a street parade in New Orleans on the Saturday after Thanksgiving -- a parade to give thanks -- I booked a ticket right then. But I was afraid of what I would find, and of what I might not be able to find anymore. I'm in my rented S.U.V., coming from the airport on Friday afternoon, when I see the first wrecked house. I am less shocked by the car in someone's living room, or by the abundance of tennis shoes and boats on the tops of bent fences, than I am by the absence of people. I notice that the tires are too damn loud. Why am I driving on pebbles? I tour the streets -- Marigny, Roman, Burgundy, Mirabeau -- with John Coltrane. He is chanting, ''A love supreme, a love supreme. . .,'' when I see two people in masks and blue bodysuits cleaning out their homes. They wave, and I return the gesture. The only other movement that day is from a pack of scraggly dogs fighting over a plastic-foam to-go plate. When my car approaches, they don't bother to look up. They're hungry. There's an evening curfew in the city, and with the encouragement of the patrolling National Guard, I head for Saint Rose, La., to my dead grandmother Amelia's house, 24 miles away, where my brother Carl now lives. I have to pass along St. Charles Avenue, where MTV's Real World was filmed and where most of the old-money mansions appear unscathed. I notice that one family is having a tea party on their porch. I feel an abiding sadness at my core. The next day is the parade. I show up alone at 10 a.m. in front of Sweet Lorraine's, the jazz club, to join the crowds, some dressed to the nines in gold suits with shiny mahogany shoes. I spend an hour talking smack: ''Where y'at?'' ''How's your mom and them?'' ''You gone cut up out here or what?'' But soon the band chants, ''Feet can't fail me now.'' And I don't believe they can. The tuba player is in front of me; I clap hard to match his beat. Then, after we have danced wild, the Hot 8 Brass Band plays ''Just a Closer Walk With Thee'': Daily walking close to Thee/Let it be, dear Lord, let it be. The trumpet wails its slow, sweet and with-plenty rhythm, just as Jelly Roll Morton once directed. It is a funeral dirge, and on the street we're swaying through there is barely a house standing. My heart is breaking into slivers. I fall off beat because I have to navigate piles of belongings: a moldy shoe, a brightly-dressed Barbie doll, a sewing machine. At 1 p.m. we are three hours into a parade that will leave us at the foot of the Mississippi River. To break up the dancing, and to help the economy, we stop at bars along the parade route. By the time we make it to the river, I have had three rum-and-Cokes, which I drink out of plastic cups. I have also had a bowl of red beans and rice, which someone in a house with electricity has cooked for passers-by. At 3 in the afternoon, for the first time today, we start to feel our tired feet. So we limp. But it is worth it. And I want more. A native has whispered that the Mardi Gras Indians, who dress regal in hand-sewn Indian costumes during Mardi Gras, are practicing their chants the next day. The location is Tchoupitoulas and Napoleon Avenue, at a bar called Tipitina's. The Indians are mostly African-American working people; there's a Big Chief, and young boys in clean sneakers with drums and tambourines play the beat. Imagine 15 sweating men with hard voices standing in a semi-circle, singing bare-bones songs. I think of the Haitian, the Creole, the Spanish, the voodoo, the Italian, in New Orleans history. It's as if I am at Congo Square in 1865, watching Marie Laveau, voodoo priestess, twirl in a spirit dance. Near curfew, one man begins to sing. ''Mighty cooty-fiyo,'' he calls. Tambourines rattle out a snake hiss. And then they chant in unison: ''We are Indians/Indians of the nation/The wild, wild creation/We won't kneel down, not on the ground.'' As they sing, they change the words: ''We won't kneel down'' becomes ''We won't bow down.'' ''The ground'' becomes ''the dirty ground.'' I call my brother Michael in Texas and leave a taste of drum music on his voice mail. Outside it is pitch black -- because it's night, but also because the electricity is still out. Out there is an awful quiet. On my flight back to New York, I hum. Lives Sarah M. Broom is on the editorial staff of O magazine."
"A renaissance is under way on Biscayne Boulevard, the central artery of downtown Miami, where derelict motels and strip malls are being tenderly restored and scruffy neighborhoods are striving for cachet. But a defining element is about to vanish: the royal palm trees that have lined the street for decades, making clear that this is not Hartford or Detroit, but the otherworldly subtropics. Along several miles of the street, the tall, trim royals are being replaced with bushier live oaks, which planners say will provide much-needed shade and beautify the heavily traveled street. Some residents say the palm trees are not only ugly but also dangerous, threatening passing cars when they shed their cumbersome fronds. ''These are trees that look like telephone poles when they grow up,'' said Robert Flanders, whose civic group, the Upper Eastside Miami Council, supports the removal. Fighting words, one may think, for Miami, where the royal palm is emblazoned on the city seal, and palm trees, as common here as the sun, figure into virtually every advertisement for the place. Yet Biscayne Boulevard is not the only spot where palms are losing favor. Miami and the surrounding county are rethinking their landscape philosophy and embracing thick-trunked, leafy shade trees over the symbolic palm. Planners say that the region's tree canopy is woefully deficient, and that planting more shade-providing species will make Miami prettier, cleaner and more pedestrian-friendly. A study in 1996 found that only about 10 percent of Miami-Dade County was covered by tree canopy -- and that was before a disease known as citrus canker and last year's hurricanes wiped out hundreds of thousands of shade trees. Most palm trees withstood the high winds of Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, making their dwindling popularity all the more puzzling. Some private landowners, like Skip Stoltz, a developer in Palm Beach County, are planting only palms after losing dozens of hardwood trees in the storms. ''The shade trees are much less expensive, but it doesn't matter,'' said Mr. Stoltz, who said he would spend up to $100,000 replacing toppled trees with palms. ''It's a very good investment. The idea is you don't want to have a huge cleanup bill every time there are 100-mile-per-hour winds.'' Miami and Miami-Dade County officials said they were not moving forward haphazardly, but cataloging which shade trees survived the storms and which succumbed. The Ficus benjamina, a stately but shallow-rooted weakling, proved especially vulnerable, along with the laurel oak, the black olive and the mahogany. ''Let's not have them put more Ficus benjamina out there so we can go through this same thing again,'' said Alyce Robertson, director of the county's new community image office. Mayor Manny Diaz of Miami has started a ''canopy campaign'' to plant shade trees in places that are barren or too heavy on palms. Miami-Dade County, meanwhile, is planning a ''tree summit'' to decide which species to invest heavily in. The idea is not to overshadow the palm population but to create more harmony between palms and other trees, Ms. Robertson said. ''If you come here as a tourist in January you certainly want to see palm trees,'' she said. ''But in July in South Florida, you don't want to stand under a palm tree. Let's have a balance here, folks.'' Even the palm-obsessed -- and they are legion here -- agree that Miami needs more thoughtful landscape planning. From its founding in 1896, the city's look has been characterized by what goes up fastest and makes the most money. Developers felled countless shade trees as Miami became a resort town and planted inexpensive types of palms -- which could be plunked full grown in front of hotels and condominiums and screamed ''paradise'' -- willy-nilly. ''They want trees that are cheap, easy to carry around and grow fast,'' said Steve Stern, who owns a nursery called Exotic Palms in Homestead. ''Other trees do not provide immediate gratification.'' No matter that the palms' coconuts become missiles during hurricanes and their fronds plummet to the ground when passers-by least expect it. Mr. Stern is among many for whom Miami's palm trees are a source of intense civic pride, a unique asset it can flaunt to the rest of the country. Los Angeles has palms, but its most common type, the Washingtonia robusta, are spindlier than Miami's. John Updike once described the palms there as ''isolate, like psychopaths.'' The palms in Las Vegas are imported, as are the rows of date palms along the Embarcadero in San Francisco. The royal palms of Biscayne Boulevard came under threat at least once before, in 2003, when the parking authority in Miami wanted to uproot about 40 of them to make room for an auto race. The plan was scrapped because of protests. But even earlier, in 2001, the county drew up a ''street tree master plan'' that advocated planting fewer palms. ''While palms are aesthetically pleasing and look 'tropical,' '' the plan says, ''they do not provide the same environmental benefits, walkable streets, or lower ambient temperatures as hardwood shade trees.'' Ms. Robertson, the community image director, said that technically, palms were not even trees. ''They are a monocot as opposed to a dicot,'' she wrote in an e-mail message, referring to the fact that the trunks of palms do not thicken with age and their vascular systems are different than those of, say, maple trees. An ideal balance may be planting shade trees along sidewalks and palm trees as ''accents,'' she said, perhaps in medians. That is in the plan for Biscayne Boulevard, which is getting a new median as part of the beautification project. Mr. Flanders, of the Upper Eastside Miami Council, said any new palms would not require as much water as the royals, natives of the Everglades that he said were too thirsty for the space. But Elvis Cruz, a community activist who opposes the removal of the royal palms, said planting shade trees along the boulevard would hurt businesses by making them less visible. He also said it was a ''falsehood'' that palm trees did not provide shade. ''I've stood in the shade of many a palm tree in my lifetime,'' said Mr. Cruz, who later sent more statements by e-mail in defense of royal palms along Biscayne Boulevard. (Among them: ''If a tourist were to come here and see a Biscayne Boulevard of oak trees, she might say, 'Why did I come here? I could have stayed in New Jersey.' '') The royal palms, about 80 strong, will be sent not to the mulch pile but to Watson Island, a desolate strip between downtown Miami and South Beach. The island is being redeveloped with luxury hotels, a spa and a mega-yacht marina -- a combination that could seem incomplete without rows of swaying palms."
"For decades, Kerry Emanuel, the meteorologist and hurricane specialist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was known as a cautious centrist on questions of global warming and hurricane ferocity. Professor Emanuel asserted often that no firm link had been established between warming and the intensity and frequency of hurricanes. But in August, two weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, Professor Emanuel wrote in the journal Nature that he had discovered statistical evidence that hurricanes were indeed affected by global warming. He linked the increased intensity of storms to the heating of the oceans. ''His paper has had a fantastic impact on the policy debate,'' said Stephen Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford. ''Emanuel's this conservative, apolitical guy, and he's saying, 'Global warming is real.' '' On a recent visit to New York, Professor Emanuel, who is 50, said, ''It's been quite a ride since the Nature article.'' He added, ''But it's a really bad thing for a scientist to have an immovable, intractable position.'' Q. Let's go back to late August. What were your feelings as you watched television and saw Hurricane Katrina heading toward New Orleans? A. I'll go back to a few days before that. As Katrina was making up off the coast of Florida, it was already an interesting storm. Though she was weak, the prediction was she was going to hit Florida. But when Katrina came off the west coast of Florida, there were new predictions taking it into the central gulf and then up toward New Orleans, and I became concerned. Many people in my profession had been worried about New Orleans for a very long time. And we had always envisioned these worst-case scenarios, and this was beginning to look like one of those. And so I plotted out the position of the ''loop current,'' which is this warm current of water in the Gulf of Mexico, and the forecast had the hurricane going right up the axis of this loop current. I remember looking at that, and alarms went off. I had this terrible feeling of dread, which deepened when the hurricane was elevated to a Category 5. We all knew that the pumps that kept New Orleans dry wouldn't be able to handle more than about a Category 3. My mother has an elderly friend in New Orleans, and I did something I never do. I sent her a message: ''You ought to get out, now!'' In retrospect, I will say that had Katrina been 30 miles further west, the death toll could have been much worse. New Orleans would have flooded more rapidly and to deeper levels. Q. Because last year's hurricane season was so intense, many people declared: ''Ah, ha! Global warming!'' Were they right? A. My answer is, Not so fast. That may have been a contributor. But the fact we had such a bad season was mostly a matter of chance. On the other hand, though the number of storms globally remained nearly constant, the frequency of Atlantic storms has been rising in concert with tropical ocean temperature, probably because of global warming. There is no doubt that in the last 20 years, the earth has been warming up. And it's warming up much too fast to ascribe to any natural process we know about. We still don't have a good grasp of how clouds and water vapor, the two big feedbacks in the climate system, will respond to global warming. What we are seeing is a modest increase in the intensity of hurricanes. I predicted years ago that if you warmed the tropical oceans by a degree Centigrade, you should see something on the order of a 5 percent increase in the wind speed during hurricanes. We've seen a larger increase, more like 10 percent, for an ocean temperature increase of only one-half degree Centigrade. Q. So what are the implications of increased ocean temperatures? A. Not much for storms at the time of landfall. But if you look at the whole life of storms in large ocean basins, we are seeing changes. And even if that doesn't have an immediate effect, people ought to be concerned about this because it is a large change in a natural phenomenon. Q. There are scientists who say of fossil fuel consumption and global warming, We may not have all the evidence yet, but we ought to be acting as if the worst could happen. Do you agree? A. It's always struck me as odd that this country hasn't put far more resources into research on alternative energy. Europeans are. France has managed to go 85 percent nuclear in its electrical generation. And the Europeans have gotten together to fund a major nuclear fusion project. It almost offends my pride as a U.S. scientist that we've fallen down so badly in this competition. Q. How did hurricanes become your specialty? A. When I was a child, we lived in Florida for three years, and I went through of a couple of hurricanes and was very impressed by them. Later, at M.I.T., I was asked to teach a course in tropical meteorology, which included hurricanes. As I started preparing, I realized I didn't understand what I'd been taught on the subject. As with many things, you think you understand something until you try to teach it. After some reading, I realized that the reigning theory had to be wrong. This theory held that the main thing that drives a hurricane is just ingestion of enormous quantities of water vapor from the atmospheric environment. It made predictions that weren't true. So it became a very big intellectual challenge to me. The more I got into it, the more interesting it became. Q. Given what you know about hurricanes, should we be building beachfront housing on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts? A. Disaster specialists will tell you that part of the increasing lethality of land-falling hurricanes isn't related to nature. A lot of it has to do with human activity. We're moving to the coasts in droves, like lemmings. We're building waterfront structures there that aren't necessarily strong. We're taxing the infrastructure and paying a big price for doing that. Q. Would you ever buy a house on the beach? A. I'd love to! But if I could do that, I'd insist on paying for my risk. And I'd do what is now being called ''the Fire Island option,'' which involves putting up flimsy houses that you don't mind losing to a storm. You don't insure them. Q. Almost concurrent to Hurricane Katrina, you published a beautifully packaged book, ''Divine Wind: The History and Science of Hurricanes.'' How did you feel about the timing of its publication? A. Not terribly good. If one is just interested in sales, I suppose it was fortuitous. But I was trying to convey a sense of hurricanes as not just things of scientific interest, but as beautiful. A leopard is a very beautiful animal. But if you took it out of its cage, it would go for your jugular. Anyone can understand that neither a leopard nor a hurricane is a willful killer. A Conversation with Kerry Emanuel"
"WHILE Hurricane Wilma was ravaging this plutocrats' playground with sustained winds of 110 miles an hour on Oct. 24, 2005, Mario Nievera, Palm Beach's leading landscape architect, was in Pennsylvania, putting on a brave face as he delivered a lecture about his work to the Philadelphia Garden Club. As Mr. Nievera showed slides of his more exquisite creations -- purple bougainvillea wrapped around coconut palms and allées of guava trees -- the plants themselves were being ripped to shreds by Wilma, which would ultimately cause $12.2 billion worth of property damage to Florida. Having struggled for more than a year to revive gardens destroyed in September 2004 by Hurricane Frances -- the most destructive storm to hit the town since 1947 -- Mr. Nievera was daunted at having to start all over again. Although he stood to profit mightily, he dreaded the added stress. In the wake of Wilma, he said in mid-January, ''there's twice as much work, on top of all our ongoing projects.'' ''And there are only so many hours in the day,'' he added, particularly in Palm Beach, where a job like his requires ceaseless socializing with fretful clients. After Frances and then, just three weeks later, Jeanne, ''nobody believed we'd get another hurricane'' Mr. Nievera said. Many of his clients rushed to restore their gardens to manicured perfection in late 2004 and in 2005, only to have them ripped out again by Wilma. Mr. Nievera said most of his clients are growing more cautious about how they spend their garden budgets and asking for plants and trees that are more likely to survive another hurricane. They appear to be heeding warnings from meteorologists that the area could face more major hurricanes in coming years. Before Wilma ''the sky was the limit,'' he said, referring in particular to the sums spent on recreating his tropical but tailored designs after the 2004 hurricanes. A client who approached him for the first time after those storms commissioned a garden with $1 million worth of plants, which was installed just in time for Wilma's arrival. ''My client lost $500,000 worth of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said, adding, ''there's no such thing as hurricane insurance.'' Wilma struck as Mr. Nievera was scurrying to get his clients' gardens ready for Thanksgiving, which some regard as the start of the winter season in Palm Beach. As a result of the devastation, he is still working to finish several of the projects two months into the season -- a delay that few clients would have tolerated in years past. The follies of the 2004-05 winter season have proven useful in one way, enabling Mr. Nievera to tailor his advice to clients based on his own observations of which plants can withstand extreme winds. When he advised Tom Quick, a Palm Beach resident whose fortune derives from Quick & Reilly, the former discount brokerage firm, to buy a pair of 30-foot date palms to replace a couple of coconut palms that had succumbed to Frances, it was for aesthetic reasons: they were large enough to hide a view of the house next door that had been opened up by Frances. But the date palms, which cost roughly $10,000 apiece and cost $20,000 more to transport and install by crane, proved a practical investment. ''I can't complain: they survived Wilma,'' said Mr. Quick, surveying his backyard. A large clusia tree at the back of his house was less fortunate, and is now in dire shape. ''We're planning to replace it,'' Mr. Nievera said. ''We just can't find the tree.'' Despite an abundance of nurseries in South Florida, plants have been irksomely scarce. ''There are 10 times the number of people looking for plants,'' Mr. Nievera said. ''People wanted to replant their annuals, but there were none to be had. And when that happens, everyone gets really mad.'' Huge price increases have also caused some ire. ''Palm trees used to cost $600,'' said Terry Allen Kramer, a perennially tanned banking heiress who is also a Nievera client. ''Now one lousy palm tree is three thousand. And these are just plain old coconut palms. Not royal palms.'' Ms. Kramer was startled when she and her husband, Nick Simunek, flew to Palm Beach the day after Wilma. Her palatial estate on South Ocean Boulevard ''looked like the Sahara,'' Ms. Kramer said. ''I had four feet of sand on my oceanfront lawn, and there was a swath of trees down in the front.'' This after she had spent $50,000 redoing the north and south border gardens, following Frances. The fruit trees have been replaced, but with the rise in prices Ms. Kramer is holding out until spring before deciding whether to replace the 30-foot palms she lost on the ocean side. Many people are ''waiting to see if they really want to spend that money,'' Mr. Nievera said. ''It's a real change in mentality.'' Other clients, though, have asked him to stormproof their grounds, to whatever extent possible. Earle Mack, whose appointment as ambassador to Finland had just ended when Wilma struck, and his wife, Carol, had to deploy an army of assistants to clean up their estate, which overlooks the ocean and Lake Worth. ''We had 17 workers at the house for three weeks,'' Mrs. Mack said. ''There was a couple of feet of sand covering everything. There wasn't a single leaf on one shrub or tree.'' The couple asked Mr. Nievera to redesign the front of the property, the worst-hit area. A defoliated stretch of Australian pine hedge that ran 100 feet along the front wall was replaced by a low-lying row of pittosporum, a hardy broadleaf evergreen shrub. By the front door Mr. Nievera created a pair of parterres edged with Purple Queen ground cover and Green Island ficus, interlaced with diamond-shaped sections of sand-colored Chattahoochee stone gravel and contrasting black lava rock. ''It's hard to get any colorful plants to grow on the ocean side of the house,'' Mr. Nievera said, ''so I chose the purple shrubs and gravel to create a sense of color.'' In the center he placed six mimusop trees, which he described as ''very salt tolerant, hard to find and hurricane resistant.'' The ravages of Frances and Wilma also inspired Mr. Nievera to redesign the garden of his own house, a single-story Bermuda-style ranch at the south end of Palm Beach, which he bought in 2001 for a bargain $495,000. In November he tore out an allée of storm-ravaged guava trees that used to line his front walkway and replaced them with pygmy dates, which are more resilient. He also cut down all his coconut trees, which had mostly been killed. ''I couldn't take it anymore,'' he said. And he came up with a novel solution for his ficus hedges, which took a serious beating during both hurricanes. ''Ficus are the least wind-tolerant of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said. They tend to lose their leaves and are easily uprooted. ''The tendency in Palm Beach is to maintain them very high -- 20 or 30 feet. But you can't do that, because the wind rips right through them.'' After Frances punched large holes in the ficus, Mr. Nievera decided to trim the top of the hedge into an undulating wave pattern to complement the missing sections, giving it a crazy-quilt style that he refers to as his roller coaster. Meanwhile, for his clients, he has been busy designing ways to conceal an awkward but increasingly familiar addition to Palm Beach's topography: the large propane-fueled electricity generator. Both Frances and Wilma felled power lines, leaving some houses and businesses without electricity for more than a week each time. (''Palm Beach is very peculiar,'' Ms. Kramer said. ''We pay the highest property taxes, but they don't bury the electric cables.'') Without air-conditioning, toxic mold flourished in the 90-degree heat and the damp conditions that followed Frances, ruining expensive paint finishes, playing havoc with antique furniture and forcing some collectors to send paintings to the restorer. The long wait for electricity prompted several moguls to buy generators large enough to power a tropical mansion. The generators usually take up at least 100 square feet, Mr. Nievera said, and are often seven feet tall. They cost an average of $30,000, which does not include the cost of obtaining permits, digging trenches and other aspects of installation. ''It's a carbuncle in the landscape,'' Mr. Nievera said. His landscaping responsibilities now include locating the generators in accordance with local planning rules and selecting fast-growing shrubs to further conceal them. He recently obscured a giant generator behind a wall of white-flowering Confederate jasmine. ''Beauty definitely comes at a price,'' Mr. Nievera said. ''But people here can afford it.''"
"The administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program asked Congress on Wednesday to allow the elimination of discounts on as many as 1.2 million policies and suggested that the government consider requiring millions more homeowners to buy coverage. The program expects to borrow $23 billion from the Treasury to pay claims from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In written testimony to a Senate committee, David I. Maurstad, the administrator, said the program would reach its debt limit by mid-February and require another infusion of up to $5.6 billion. About 1.2 million policyholders, or about 24 percent, receive discounts on premiums because their homes predate flood maps. Mr. Maurstad asked Congress for the authority to phase out those discounts. Mr. Maurstad also asked Congress to order the program's parent agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to study expanding coverage requirements to properties in areas known as 500-year flood plains, with a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in any year, and to properties protected by levees and dams. He estimated that would affect four million to six million properties."
"Into the void of the post-Katrina policy landscape, littered with half-ruined proposals, crumbling prescriptions and washed-out initiatives, an obscure and very conservative congressman has stepped in with the ultimate big government solution. Representative Richard H. Baker, a Republican from suburban Baton Rouge who derides Democrats for not being sufficiently free-market, is the unlikely champion of a housing recovery plan that would make the federal government the biggest landowner in New Orleans -- for a while, at least. Mr. Baker's proposed Louisiana Recovery Corporation would spend as much as $80 billion to pay off lenders, restore public works, buy huge ruined chunks of the city, clean them up and then sell them back to developers. Desperate for a big-scale fix to the region's huge real estate problem, Louisiana officials and business leaders of all stripes -- black and white, Republican and Democrat -- have embraced this little-known congressman and his grandiose plan, calling its passage crucial. While the White House has yet to sign on, there are already signs that some Congressional leaders are interested in pursuing it; Mr. Baker said administration officials had not rejected it outright. The passage of the bill has become increasingly important to Louisiana because the state lost out to the greater political power of Mississippi last month when Congress passed a $29 billion aid package for the Gulf states region. The package gave Mississippi about five times as much per household in housing aid as Louisiana received -- a testimony to the clout of Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a former Republican National Committee chairman, and Senator Thad Cochran, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Louisiana officials say they were forced to go along with the appropriation, because they may not have received an aid package at all otherwise. But now they are focused even more intently on Mr. Baker's buyout bill; many economists here say there may be no alternative to buyouts for homeowners who cannot make mortgage payments on ruined properties. ''It's probably one of the few last best hopes out there for people whose homes were flooded, and had no flood insurance,'' said Loren C. Scott, an emeritus economist at Louisiana State University. ''Without this kind of help, there's a very large number of people who are just sunk.'' James A. Richardson, director of the university's Public Administration Institute, said, ''It's the only game in town, to a certain extent.'' Mr. Baker's ideological opposite in the Louisiana Congressional delegation, William J. Jefferson, a New Orleans Democrat, said passage of the bill was important. ''Without it,'' he said, ''homeowners have very little chance of realizing any of the equity they've lost.'' Under his plan, the Louisiana Recovery Corporation would step in to prevent defaults, similar in general nature to the Resolution Trust Corporation set up by Congress in 1989 to bail out the savings and loan industry. It would offer to buy out homeowners, at no less than 60 percent of their equity before Hurricane Katrina. Lenders would be offered up to 60 percent of what they are owed. To finance these expenditures, the government would sell bonds and pay them off in part with the proceeds from the sale of land to developers. Property owners would not have to sell, but those who did would have an option to buy property back from the corporation. The federal corporation would have nothing to do with the redevelopment of the land; those plans would be drawn up by local authorities and developers. To succeed, the proposal will eventually require the support of the White House. And the signals, according to this staunch Republican who boasts of near-perfect rankings from conservative groups, have been distinctly mixed. President Bush, riding in a car with Mr. Baker on a trip here in late September, ''got it,'' Mr. Baker insisted in an interview at his office here, in the city he has unobtrusively represented in Washington for two decades. ''He was very open to it. He said, 'Work on it and get back to Hubbard,' '' referring to Mr. Bush's top economic adviser, Allan B. Hubbard. With Congress set to adjourn last month and with the plan hanging in the balance, Mr. Baker received a visit on a Sunday morning from Donald E. Powell, the president's Gulf Coast recovery czar. Mr. Baker said Mr. Powell, was now ''more comfortable'' with the proposal, but was still not wholly convinced after an hour of discussion. The bill sank, despite a successful scramble to unite the disparate Louisiana delegation behind it and appeals from business leaders. Yet, with promises from senators to take up the bill quickly when Congress reconvenes and signs that the White House has not turned its back, the cautious Mr. Baker figures that his odds are better than even. Sean Reilly, a member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, said Mr. Powell had told him the White House was ''on board'' with the concept, but needed to tweak the idea a bit. ''It came very close,'' said Walter Isaacson, vice chairman of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, established by the governor to oversee reconstruction. Top White House advisers ''basically like the principle,'' he said. And there were promises from them that ''we'll work with you, and we'll get it on the fast track'' for hearings in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Mr. Isaacson said. Mr. Baker's fellow conservatives, in Congress and out, are worried about the huge scale of his proposed intervention. In the House Financial Services Committee, several members tried unsuccessfully to limit the proposal's spending and duration, or to require that it break even. ''It is irresponsible for Congress to write a blank check, drawn on the account of American taxpayers, bound only by the imagination of politicians,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas. ''We need to ensure that taxpayers are not asked again two or three years from now to pay for the same disaster.'' Mr. Baker says to his critics: ''If not this, what? And the answers are not good.'' A sobering early flyover of the ruined neighborhoods in New Orleans convinced him that ordinary solutions would not work. Here was a problem way beyond the capacity of private enterprise. ''In this case, everything's gone,'' Mr. Baker said. ''Total elimination. So I have argued that this does require a precedent-setting remedy. And if we don't do this, what do you foresee for the region two years from now?'' Soft-spoken, mild-mannered and with the choirboy demeanor of a minister's son, Mr. Baker has spent years toiling in arcane financial-services regulation. With the calm of a man used to consorting with bankers and poring over balance sheets, he lays it all out: tens of thousands of strapped homeowners, owing millions in mortgage payments on properties of dubious value, to multiple lending institutions. His effort is filled with paradoxes. Mr. Baker has devoted much of his Congressional career to reining in the quasi-governmental lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying they have too much power. Now, ''as free market as I am,'' he said, he wants the government to take action in a way it never has before. Another oddity is that Mr. Baker is so invisible, even in his own district, that ''most people in Baton Rouge wouldn't recognize him,'' said Wayne Parent, a political science professor at L.S.U. In a state that values flash in its politicians, ''You don't hear much said about him,'' Mr. Parent said. Yet, Mr. Bakerhas suddenly stepped to the forefront of a Louisiana political class that has been notably bereft of ideas. He was elected from a mostly white, suburban district, one relatively prosperous by Louisiana standards and historically resentful of the once-larger city to the east. Yet, his initiative could wind up largely benefiting African-Americans in New Orleans. In the House, his idea was embraced by liberals -- ''I think it's a good idea,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts -- and shunned by many conservatives. The proposal is about as ''good as you get,'' Mr. Isaacson said. ''My feeling is it's a test of how sincere the administration is in saying it wants a careful and smart rebuilding effort.''"
"HURRICANE season came to an official end more than a month ago, but it is continuing to take a toll -- and for longer than expected -- on the finances of chemical and oil companies. DuPont and BP warned yesterday that operational disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita would hurt their fourth-quarter results. The hurricanes, which were the most damaging of the 27 named storms last year, hit the Gulf Coast in late August and September. Physical damage and flooding were intense in some parts of the region, which has a large concentration of energy and petrochemical plants. The biggest challenges were logistical -- downed power lines, natural gas shortages and the slow return of workers -- and were concentrated in the early part of the fourth quarter, said Ben Dell, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Most Gulf Coast chemical plants and refineries are back to full operations. He cautioned, however, that the hurricanes could become a catch-all excuse used by companies reporting profit shortfalls during this earnings season. ''Everyone who is going to miss the consensus number is going to throw out the hurricane as an excuse,'' he said, referring to the analyst earnings estimates used by Wall Street to grade the performances of companies in any given quarter. In DuPont's case, executives said they were ''overly aggressive'' in previous predictions about how quickly the company would be able to completely restore the 14 plants it was forced to close in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on preliminary figures, the company said those disruptions, along with rising raw materials prices and operational problems at three other factories unaffected by the storms, would lower DuPont's quarterly profits to about 10 cents a share, from a forecast of 20 cents to 25 cents a share made in October. DuPont missed analysts' earnings expectations in the first two quarters of 2005, but came in above Wall Street's forecast in the third quarter after excluding one-time charges. ''We underestimated the effect Katrina and Rita would have on our business in the fourth quarter,'' Charles O. Holliday Jr., the chairman and chief executive of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, told Wall Street analysts in a conference call yesterday. ''I have worked for DuPont for over 40 years, and the fourth quarter of 2005 was one of the most unusual quarters in my history with the company.'' Mr. Holliday repeatedly said he was ''extremely disappointed'' by DuPont's performance, saying at the outset of the call that the company should have done better. ''While a significant number of factors leading to yesterday's announcement were caused by events beyond our control, an equal amount could have been prevented, and we should have prevented them,'' he said. Shares of DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., fell $1.41, to $41.14. At BP, storm damage limited how much oil and gas it could pump from the Gulf of Mexico, shut a huge refinery in Texas and hurt its ability to supply fuel to retail outlets and other customers. The company estimates it lost $900 million in profits for the quarter at its Texas City refinery, after losing $500 million in profits in the third quarter. The company will also face $130 million in additional costs, most of that to repair damaged offshore platforms and rigs. In the quarter, BP's oil and gas production in the gulf declined by 160,000 barrels; production fell by 135,000 barrels in the third quarter. The company's total worldwide production was down about 2 percent. A BP spokesman could not say when the company would restart its refinery in Texas City, near Houston, which can process up to 460,000 barrels of oil a day and was closed as Hurricane Katrina approached. The company has used the last several months to repair damage the refinery suffered in a large explosion last March that killed 15 workers and wounded 170 employees. ''Once it was down, it is quite difficult to bring these refiners back up again,'' said Toby Odone, a BP spokesman in London, where the company is based. ''The decision was made that while it is down, let's bring it back up safely and soundly.'' To put the forgone profits and production into context, BP and other oil companies have been reporting soaring profits because the price of oil, gasoline and other fuels jumped to new heights in the aftermath of the hurricanes. BP posted a 34 percent increase in third-quarter profits, to $6.46 billion. In its statement, the company estimated that its full-year 2005 refining profits would be about $1.1 billion higher than in 2004 because of higher prices and that the rise in crude oil prices would add another $500 million. In a move the company said was unrelated to the hurricanes, Mr. Odone said BP would cut 1,000 jobs in Europe to reduce costs. BP is also taking a $1.3 billion charge in the fourth quarter to account for the difference between the rise in the spot price for natural gas and the lower prices it had agreed to sell the commodity for in Britain. American depository receipts of BP fell 28 cents, to $67.90. DuPont will announce fourth-quarter results on Jan. 24, and BP will report on Feb. 7. MARKET PLACE"
"With activists, planners and residents squaring off over which neighborhoods will be demolished and which will be rebuilt, state officials are warning that some low-lying neighborhoods may not be eligible for federal rebuilding assistance. Sean Reilly, a member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, the state body formed partly to manage the flow of federal money to the state, castigated city officials on Wednesday for assuring residents that every neighborhood flooded after Hurricane Katrina would be rebuilt. Mr. Reilly made it clear that federal money, at least in some forms, was unlikely to go to those areas. ''The L.R.A. will not fund an irrational and unsafe rebuilding plan,'' Mr. Reilly said in Baton Rouge. ''Someone has to be tough, to stand up, and to tell the truth. Every neighborhood in New Orleans will not be able to come back safe and viable. The L.R.A. is speaking the truth with the money it controls.'' Until now, political leaders in New Orleans have been reluctant to tell residents that some areas may be too damaged or too vulnerable to flooding to be rebuilt at the same pace as others less damaged. The City Council recently rejected a proposal by the Urban Land Institute, a planning group that advises the city, to focus rebuilding on higher ground and urge residents not to return immediately to heavily damaged areas like the impoverished Lower Ninth Ward. In a vote last month, the Council promised that all neighborhoods would be rebuilt. ''Resources should be disbursed to all areas in a consistent and uniform fashion,'' the Council said in a resolution. To protest the idea that some areas should not be rebuilt, some neighborhood activists have been fighting the city plan to begin demolishing ruined houses in some low-lying neighborhoods. On the streets of the Lower Ninth Ward on Thursday, one group was able, at least temporarily, to stop the city from clearing streets littered with debris from ruined houses. The group of residents and activists rushed to Reynes Street in the Lower Ninth Ward when they heard that a backhoe was moving debris. After angry calls to City Hall, the group persuaded officials to stop the work. Many houses on Reynes Street, near the levee break on the Industrial Canal, are no more than immense piles of rubble. In some cases, the piles spill out into what remains of the street. Nonetheless, the group said the city's action violated a court agreement that no demolitions proceed until hearings are held. City officials insist that they simply want to clear away 100 of the most damaged houses. Activists, pointing to earlier official statements, say up to 2,500 damaged houses are threatened with demolition and have criticized the city for failing to contact their owners. ''They were scraping people's homes, trying to clear the roads,'' Ishmael Muhammad, a lawyer, said at the protest. ''You have to do your work and contact the owners. They have value in there. We know the city has a need, as well. But don't just go willy-nilly demolishing people's homes.'' Officials did not respond to telephone calls for comment. Activists and lawyers for the city are to meet with a federal judge on Friday to decide on the course of a suit over the demolitions. Mayor C. Ray Nagin's rebuilding commission is scheduled to issue its planning blueprint for the city next week. In the meantime, the state recovery authority, which controls the spending of billions of dollars in federal aid, has quietly begun taking action to ensure that the money will not be spent randomly around the city. In a little-noticed vote last month, the authority agreed not to spend money on rebuilding that does not conform to federal flood maps, which experts expect the Federal Emergency Management Agency to issue shortly. Under those rules, all houses built in the lowest-lying areas would have to be elevated, a requirement that would add tens of thousands of dollars to the cost for each house and probably make it impossible for low-income families to rebuild. The most damaged neighborhoods, including the Lower Ninth Ward, Gentilly and Lakeview, would be the most directly affected. ''At some point, tough decisions have to be made,'' Mr. Reilly emphasized in an interview on Thursday. ''We can ensure that federal dollars sent our way are spent to build stronger and keep people out of harm's way. I think the implications are real. Development will have to be in conformity with those new flood advisory maps.''"
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency has followed through on its promise to offer up to $3.6 billion worth of temporary-housing maintenance contracts to small and minority-owned businesses across the South. The 36 contracts, each worth up to $100 million, shift the work in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita from giant engineering firms like Bechtel, based in California, to small companies, many with little experience in the field. FEMA officials said Friday that unlike the first round of deals reached soon after the storm, the new contracts were competitively bid. The change will help the regional economy, they said. ''FEMA is dedicated to the recovery of the Gulf Coast region and its economy,'' said Aaron T. Walker, the agency's press secretary. ''What better way to stimulate the economy than to encourage small businesses to grow and flourish?'' The winning bidders include DSC Enterprises of San Antonio, which cleans buildings and does remodeling, according to a company profile filed with the Small Business Administration, and the Smith Research Corporation of Baton Rouge, La., a minority-owned consulting firm. Each company, financial records indicate, has about 20 employees. Another winning bidder, LSI Research of Huntsville, Ala., got its start repairing laser printers before moving into the computer sales business, according to its Web site. The contracts call for the companies to maintain the 106,000 travel trailers and mobile homes that FEMA has installed along the Gulf Coast as temporary housing for victims of the hurricanes. The work is expected to continue for five years and will ultimately include removing the trailers. The giant engineering companies that will be phased out of the work -- Shaw, Bechtel, CH2M Hill, and Fluor -- have made a considerable amount from hurricane-related work performed to date, ranging from $237 million for CH2M Hill to $875 million, for Fluor. Some of the companies appear to have experience in related fields. They include MLU Services of Athens, Ga., which does disaster cleanup work, and Crown Roofing of Kenner, La.. Both companies have already done government work related to last year's hurricanes. LEC-CMS of Plano, Tex., another bid winner, is an engineering and project management firm. ''It is a big job, but not that big of a job,'' said Ray Palmer, an executives at Crown Roofing, which has about 150 employees. MLU Services is run by executives who have contributed to Republicans that include President Bush. The president of that company, which has about 100 employees and does disaster cleanup work, Marcia L. Ulm, and her relatives have donated a total of $165,371 to Republican committees and candidates across the country, campaign finance records show. Mr. Walker said that before each new contract was awarded, FEMA examined the finances and past work of each applicant. Of the 36 winning bidders, 28 are based in Gulf Coast states, the agency said. The companies will be given work in increments, allowing FEMA, if necessary, to terminate an agreement if a company cannot honor its commitments. What is clear for most of the winning bidders is that this is by far the biggest contract they have ever received, and in some cases, the first work they have ever landed with the federal government. In many cases, as with Davis Professional Accounting Services of New Orleans, a small financial services company, the winning bidders will hire subcontractors or work with partners to allow them to increase their staff quickly. Davis Professional, like several of the winning bidders, is run by a black woman. Others are run by Hispanics or American Indians, among other minorities. Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, who criticized FEMA's reliance on large out-of-state corporations for most of the initial work, praised the changes. ''FEMA is finally doing the right thing, or is at least on the right track to doing the right thing,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''Cleaning up and rebuilding the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will take several more years and billions more dollars. It requires the vested interest and passion found in area businesses with an interest in recovery.''"
"WINDSWEPT The Story of Wind and Weather. By Marq de Villiers. Illustrated. 344 pp. Walker & Company. $25. IF raging storms have a sensitive dependence on initial conditions, in the words of the chaos theorists, so -- it would seem -- does Marq de Villiers, a co-author of ''Sahara: The Extraordinary History of the World's Largest Desert.'' Early in ''Windswept'' he writes, ''In the grip of the gale, the child skidded across the grass until he landed with a crack against the metal railings that were all that prevented him from being hurled into the ocean. . . . It was there that my mother came, and fetched me away, and tried to still my terror with her beating heart.'' A fear of big wind has never left him (it doesn't help that he's practically a magnet for hurricanes), but luckily for us, it's driven him to investigate how bad weather starts, and why. To dramatize the search for answers, de Villiers unfurls and magnifies the story of Hurricane Ivan, a peculiarly malevolent storm in 2004 that lasted nearly three weeks, killed scores of people, turned out the lights in more than a million homes and spawned some 111 tornadoes in five states. Like many Atlantic storms, Ivan began as an updraft in the southern Sahara. How it intensified (or became ''better organized,'' in the parlance of meteorologists), raged and eventually split in two, with one track whipping across de Villiers's Nova Scotia beach, makes a compelling ticktock and vividly illustrates that science knows a great deal about the how and when of storm formation, but not so much about the why. The same initial conditions that cause hurricanes can also beget nothing. ''Windswept'' moves breezily through the meaning of wind -- what it represented for the ancients, and how it was personified as arbitrary and angry -- to a history of our understanding of it, from early measurements of air pressure to the discovery that storms travel, and then on to the science of accurate measurement, the art of prediction and the appearance, on Jan. 11, 1954, of the first TV forecast. ''Well-coiffed weather people have been with us ever since,'' the author writes. Some of the liveliest bits cover how wind smashes up structures and how it has been used for sailing, flying, cooling, grinding corn and generating power. Throughout, de Villiers stresses that winds are important agents of planetary self-government, and as such make life on earth possible. Winds, both gentle and giant, redistribute air, moisture and heat vertically and latitudinally, they scrub the air of pollutants, and they accelerate the movement of the great ocean currents that keep our planet stable. It's a sunny picture, one that leads de Villiers to marvel at our cosmic connection to the planetary whole, which he briefly likens to a drafty dance hall. But on further rumination, ''this was not as comfortable a feeling as you might expect, because there is a practical downside as well as a philosophical upside to interconnectedness.'' You can hear the other shoe drop: ''We're all shut-ins in this great global ballroom,'' and we're poisoning it with the byproducts of coal-combustion, with aerosols, ozone, organic pollutants and heavy metals. The amount of transported African dust, laden with fungal spores and bacterial cysts, has risen steadily over the past 25 years, along with the mortality rates of Caribbean coral and sea fans -- ''an object lesson in the interconnectedness of life.'' And he hasn't even gotten to the ways that higher global temperatures will affect the wind, the weather and the climate. Early on, de Villiers warns that winds are ''horribly intricate in their local behavior.'' The reader sighs, knowing the author's going to make a stab at explaining that behavior. Soon enough, there is a slog through intertropical convergence zones, tropical cyclone bogussing schemes and a lot of drawings with arrows. De Villiers admits this isn't always simple, and that's a comfort. His clarity and sense of humor help, too: part of the ionosphere, he writes, has a frequency that reflects medium-wave radio transmissions, ''thereby allowing Midwestern country-and-western stations to be heard over the horizon in, say, Maine, to the great benefit of listeners there pining for hurtin' music.'' If you can get through the tough parts -- which, let's face it, are mandatory in this sort of book -- there's ample reward. Bad weather almost always makes good copy, and those who study wind and weather can be counted on to do all sorts of neat things, like flying planes into howling hurricanes, building massive wind tunnels and modeling the topography and breezes around the 11th green and 12th tee of Augusta National Golf Course, which have been known to wreak havoc with ''the pocketbooks of a handful of very wealthy men.'' After firing a current through a copper wire coated with titanium tetrachloride (representing the ball's trajectory), filming the smoke and plotting its path on digital video with ''stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry,'' researchers determined that, yes, the wind was a little screwy around the Amen Corner, and it's all because of the trees. Was Augusta going to remove them? No way. The pace of ''Windswept'' falters toward the end, but develops a rush of moral certitude when the author visits various wind farms (at one, the tips of enormous blades spin well in excess of 100 miles per hour in a fresh breeze) and contemplates a future without oil. De Villiers is realistic about the benefits, the hype and the true price of wind power (the wind industry, he says, has an ''inbuilt propensity to exaggerate and lie''), but ultimately he comes down in its favor. His arguments, coming after a gloomy section on global warming, ring loud and clear. ''Nature has given us the perpetual motion machine we call wind. We can put it to work to make things better.'' 'Windswept: The Story of Wind and Weather,' by Marq de Villiers Elizabeth Royte, whose most recent book is ''Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash,'' is a frequent contributor to the Book Review."
"The sense of just how much the world had changed for the Army Corps of Engineers struck Daniel Hitchings in a tense conference call last month. Mr. Hitchings, director of the hurricane response task force for the Corps of Engineers, was on a call with representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Flood Insurance Program. He explained that the levees and floodwalls around New Orleans, both existing and new, had been designed to be tall enough to hold back storm surges, but would allow about two feet of a six-foot wave to splash over the top. The representatives from the insurance program were stunned. Water splashing over the top would violate the requirements of the federal flood insurance program, they said, though the corps has been designing levees that way for decades. It was an impasse. One federal agency's rules had come face to face with those of another, and the emergency officials were not pleased. ''We were frustrated, angry and disappointed with the news we got from the corps,'' said a senior administration official who was granted anonymity to avoid straining relations between the agencies. Those differing perceptions of flood control help explain why Donald E. Powell, federal coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding, announced on Thursday that the levees in the New Orleans region that were being rebuilt would not meet the insurance standard of protecting against a 100-year flood, the category that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year. The announcement was in many ways a candid admission that the old ways of building flood protection no longer applied. Mr. Powell insisted that the $3.4 billion in work currently under way would make the levee system stronger than ever and prevent catastrophic failure in another storm of Hurricane Katrina's strength. But he said work to bring the levees up to the standard required by the insurance agency would require as much as $6 billion in additional spending to raise levee heights, replace suspect floodwalls and take other corrective action. If FEMA cannot certify the flood-stopping power of the levees, the agency's maps will have to treat them as if they are not there. In other words, as if the land behind them is unprotected. That will have a significant effect on how neighborhoods will be rebuilt, how high off the ground homes will have to be constructed and the cost of insurance. In the old days, before Hurricane Katrina and before global warming, experts assumed that New Orleans was protected by the levees that the corps had built. Since then, however, the emerging science of weather and climate change has led to an understanding that the world is entering a cycle of stronger and more frequent storms, with higher surges and waves. Scientists have also discovered that the land under the New Orleans metropolitan area has subsided and that the levees are now lower than their original design height. Problems with the original design have also been found. Fundamentally, the notion of what constitutes a powerful storm has been altered. ''We now have a new storm of record,'' Mr. Hitchings said. ''Katrina.'' The data drawn from the experience of last August changes the equation of risk, he said. For all the new data, however, the levee system that the corps has been building is largely based on a model of a hurricane derived from data first collected in 1959. By the 70's, the National Weather Service had conducted new research that suggested that definition was too weak, but the corps did not alter its plans to accommodate the new data. ''The corps, once it's locked on a track, will not take input from outside groups,'' said Ivor van Heerden, a leader of the task force investigating the levee breaches for Louisiana and a professor with the hurricane center at Louisiana State University. In a recent interview, Col. Lewis F. Setliff, the head of the team rebuilding levees, said the corps was not like the man on the street who is free to do what he pleases and change his mind at will. ''We have to have a law in Congress that tells us to do something,'' Colonel Setliff said. Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said the problem with that lack of flexibility was that ''the data is not stable.'' Even the repairs, Professor Bea said, are problematic. ''They're building new walls, but they're building them to the old standard,'' he said. ''But we already know the old standard is inadequate.'' The corps has undertaken a two-year project at the request of Congress to propose substantial upgrades for hurricane protection in southern Louisiana. A preliminary report from that project is due in June, with a final report in December 2007. If the study comes up with proposals for what the people of Louisiana say they truly want, protection against the strongest Category 5 storms, the cost would make the additional $6 billion look like a bargain. But it would more than exceed the insurance needs, Mr. Hitchings said, adding, ''Obviously, if it was Category 5, it would be much bigger than 100-year protection.'' D. J. Nordquist, a spokeswoman for Mr. Powell, said that ''there's obviously a bigger question'' facing New Orleans, which will always have the threat of storms. ''What level of protection are people comfortable with, and what are they willing to spend?'' Ms. Nordquist asked. ''What's even feasible?'' News Analysis"
"With hurricane season approaching, the American Red Cross is expanding warehouse space and increasing stocks of supplies and communication equipment to address some of the problems it encountered after Hurricane Katrina. And in a shift in policy, it also plans to work more closely with other charities, like local churches, providing them with financial assistance. The changes are the first of many the organization is expected to make as it responds to political and public demands to overhaul its operations or lose its status as the only charity chartered by Congress to assist Americans when catastrophe strikes. The organization announced its plans yesterday at the National Hurricane Conference in Orlando, Fla., saying it would spend roughly $80 million to improve its operations in time for the official start of the hurricane season on July 1. ''Our goal is to strengthen the Red Cross's ability to help people in a disaster, based on our experience after Katrina,'' said Joseph C. Becker, senior vice president for preparedness and response. Mr. Becker said the organization had created a technological backbone that would enable it to serve two million families. Its call centers, for instance, will be able to handle 100,000 cases a day in an effort to avoid the long waits experienced by victims of Hurricane Katrina. The Red Cross has been under fire from regulators, politicians, volunteers and victims over its response to the hurricane, when it experienced problems that included overloaded telephone lines, lack of basic supplies and loose internal controls that have led to criminal fraud investigations in Louisiana. The plans Mr. Becker announced address criticism of the Red Cross's logistics management and planning and its historic reluctance to collaborate with other nonprofit groups working in disaster areas. They represent the initial steps of the organization's long-term goal of establishing a supply-chain management system as well as ties to state emergency response agencies, other relief organizations and local charities. The Red Cross collected roughly 60 percent of the more than $3 billion donated to help hurricane victims, but other organizations complained that they were doing much of the relief work. Those organizations also complained that the Red Cross's largely white, older volunteer base had been insensitive to the needs of black and immigrant victims of the storm, forcing churches and other grass-roots charities to step into the breach. ''While the Red Cross itself needs to become more diverse, we want to find the right partners who can help us handle the diversity of people affected by a disaster,'' Mr. Becker said. He said the Red Cross chapters would be encouraged to make such alliances, while the national organization worked to improve its relationship with other groups. It is already working to train staff members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was highly critical of the Red Cross, to work in shelters and take on other disaster response roles, Mr. Becker said. Perhaps most significantly, he said the organization would also share its wealth with other groups. ''We would train our partners in how to run a shelter,'' he said. ''We would support them financially, paying their bills related to providing relief.'' Correction: April 13, 2006, Thursday An article yesterday about steps by the American Red Cross to repair problems it encountered after Hurricane Katrina referred incorrectly to the deadline of July 1. It is not the start of the hurricane season; that is June 1."
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose response to Hurricane Katrina last year was widely criticized, must train its employees better, improve its computers and get more support from the Department of Homeland Security, a department inquiry concluded Friday. The report by the department's inspector general, Richard L. Skinner, said that after the Sept. 11 attacks, terrorism overshadowed natural hazards in official thinking ''even though natural disasters are more frequent and cannot be prevented.'' Nor has the takeover of the once-independent FEMA by the new Homeland Security Department been smooth, the report said. It said full integration of FEMA into the department ''requires additional work and a level of support not currently demonstrated.'' The report offered 38 recommendations for improving FEMA's performance in areas as diverse as finding housing for disaster victims, communicating better with state and local officials, and tracking shipments of ice. As for the post-mortems on the hurricane response, it said, ''Much of the criticism is warranted.''"
"Federal officials issued unexpectedly lenient guidelines on Wednesday for rebuilding the flood-damaged homes of New Orleans, potentially allowing tens of thousands of homeowners to return to their neighborhoods at costs far less than they had feared. Under the guidelines issued here by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, huge swaths of homes might still have to be rebuilt at least three feet off the ground, or risk getting no federal reconstruction money or insurance. But the announcement, anxiously anticipated as a critical step in rebuilding this still-ravaged city, was nonetheless greeted with some relief by local officials and residents. They had feared that, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic flooding, the government would demand that some houses be raised as much as 10 feet, at enormous expense. The lesser requirement assumes that the area's damaged levee system will be solidly reconstructed. To that end, federal officials also announced Wednesday that most of the system's 36 miles or so of flood walls -- which sit atop levees in places where massive earthen structures are not practical -- would be replaced. The cost for that and other levee improvements is $2.5 billion, which the Bush administration said Wednesday that it would actively seek from Congress. The announcement dovetails with a political climate in New Orleans in which the idea of not rebuilding damaged neighborhoods has been taboo. In a heated mayor's race that is now reaching its conclusion, no candidate has been willing to say some areas should not be rebuilt because of flood danger. Now, the federal government -- by making rebuilding requirements less stringent than had been anticipated -- appears to have concurred, though FEMA officials did not say specifically why they chose the three-foot figure. Some experts were critical of the decision. ''It's wacky,'' said J. Robert Hunter, a former director of the federal flood insurance program. ''Three feet -- where did that come from? Why are we building up three feet, when the water was up over the roof? ''What's that three feet going to do?'' Mr. Hunter asked. ''Instead of coming up with real science, they're making it up. Which means that people are going to be at risk, they're going to die again, and taxpayers are subsidizing unwise construction with very cheap insurance.'' In addition, though the upgraded levee system will guard against 100-year floods -- those that have a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year -- it will protect against the most powerful storms. ''One-hundred-year protection and Category 5 protection are not the same thing,'' said Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, the chief engineer of the Army Corps of Engineers. At one point over the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 storm; when it made landfall along the coast last Aug. 29, it was described as Category 3 or 4. The greatest flood damage occurred after the storm had passed and the levees and flood walls gave way. Most officials here, though, said they were relieved that homeowners can get on with rebuilding now that the federal house-raising requirement is known. ''Over all, the new flood maps released by FEMA today truly do represent some good news for the city and its rebuilding process,'' said Greg Meffert, executive assistant to Mayor C. Ray Nagin. ''Essentially, these new maps more or less maintain the city to the already previously enforced 100-year flood elevation standards.'' For months, Louisiana authorities have complained that FEMA was dragging its feet in issuing new flood-elevation requirements, the first since the mid-1980's. The delay caused uncertainty for thousands of people, they said. Now mortgages can be applied for, and lives that had been on hold can move forward. ''I would view it as good news, and I would view it as information that we can use to get on with planning our lives,'' said Sean Reilly, of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which will decide how federal rebuilding money is spent. He agreed with Donald Powell, the federal official in charge of Gulf Coast rebuilding, who said while making the announcement here, ''The good news is, it's not a dramatic-type elevation.'' As it is, many homes -- even severely damaged ones -- may not have to be raised at all, if they already meet or exceed the three-foot requirement. And since it applies only to homes that were destroyed or ''substantially damaged,'' which the guidelines describe as damage to more than half the structure, the potential impact is further reduced because city officials have been liberal in revising damage assessments downwards. In addition, virtually all two-story homes in which the first floor was wiped out but the second was untouched fall below the 50-percent threshold. ''It's good news for a lot of people,'' said Matt McBride of the Broadmoor Improvement Association. Broadmoor is a in a neighborhood that flooded badly. ''It's basically good news, in that people don't have to raise their houses to exceed Katrina flood levels. For a lot of historic homes, this doesn't change many things.'' LaToya Cantrell, for instance, president of the Broadmoor association, got five feet of water from Lake Pontchartrain, but because her house was already elevated by four feet, she will not have to raise it. Even in neighborhoods of newer houses, like those in eastern New Orleans, which was severely damaged by Katrina's flooding, the federal government's new requirement could be considered generous. ''All of the two-story houses in eastern New Orleans have less than 50 percent damage, and this doesn't affect them,'' said Mtumishi St. Julien, a homeowner in that area who heads the Housing Finance Authority of New Orleans. ''It's not going to drastically impact New Orleans, as some people suggest.'' FEMA officials, in making their announcement, declined to say how many homes would be affected, or whether the most popular, ground-level type of new construction -- slab-on-grade -- might still be allowed. The announcement by the Army Corps of Engineers that the flood walls would be replaced was the clearest admission yet by the corps that much of New Orleans' levee system had long been flawed, and was not simply overpowered by forces that went beyond what the system was designed to withstand. General Strock, the corps' chief engineer, said the entire system of flood walls would have to be examined to determine what must be replaced. ''We must assume that because the foundations of these levees are pretty much the same throughout the system'' the problem is widespread, he said. In a conference call after the announcement, General Strock said even the system being planned would not prevent flooding in New Orleans in the case of another hurricane like Katrina, ''But it will not be catastrophic flooding'' caused by a breach in the system, he said. Until the completion of the upgraded network of levees and flood walls, planned for 2010, he said, ''there is a heightened level of risk that will go down over time.'' Still uncertain is the fate of lower Plaquemines Parish, jutting into the Gulf of Mexico and severely flooded. Home to about 2 percent of the New Orleans area's population, the parish would require an additional $1.6 billion to raise its levee system to FEMA guidelines, money the Bush Administration has not promised to seek. Wednesday's advisory, as officials called it, opens the door to new flood-insurance maps, which will come later this year. Even for those who must raise their houses, the federal requirement could be good news because elevating a house by as little as five feet can cost more than $100,000. Up to $30,000 in federal money is available to homeowners for such projects. Whatever the opinions of outside experts, the new federal policy was viewed favorably here. ''Over all, it's good news in that FEMA has agreed Katrina was only a one-time event, and flood insurance won't be based on catastrophic events but on common sense,'' Mr. McBride of the Broadmoor association said."
"Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Wednesday that he would assign federal disaster-management officials to vulnerable regions before the hurricane season begins June 1, to help local governments prepare for potential storms. Speaking at the National Hurricane Conference here, Mr. Chertoff told an audience of state and local disaster officials that his agency would not usurp authority but would ''work with you in training and exercising, so that if the bell rings, we've all gotten to know each other and we know how we're all going to perform our tasks.'' A top priority, he said, would be making sure residents prepare and can subsist on their own for at least 72 hours. Mr. Chertoff, who has been intensely criticized for his handling of Hurricane Katrina last year, also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency would use new technology to track emergency supplies as they travel to disaster sites this hurricane season. After last year's storms, federal relief supplies like water and ice often showed up late or not at all. Mr. Chertoff also said FEMA would do a better job this year of processing claims for disaster victims, helping towns and cities remove hurricane debris, and communicating during a storm, so he and other leaders could immediately learn of major problems like breached levees. Michael D. Brown, the former director of FEMA who resigned under fire after Hurricane Katrina, attended the conference and told reporters that none of the planned improvements would work unless the agency separated from the Department of Homeland Security. He said FEMA's new director, R. David Paulison, was well intentioned but would be ineffective if he had to report to Mr. Chertoff. ''The problem is that within the Department of Homeland Security you are stifled in what you can do,'' said Mr. Brown, now a private consultant, who said he was visiting several clients at the conference. ''I think Chief Paulison's going to have a difficult time because he's going to be told what he can say and what he can do. And once again, there will be no accountability and people will suffer.'' Mr. Paulison told reporters at the conference that he wanted FEMA to stay under the Department of Homeland Security. ''There's simply a lot of resources there that make us so much stronger,'' he said. ''I don't see us getting lost anywhere.'' In an advance copy of Mr. Chertoff's speech distributed to reporters, he, too, talked about keeping FEMA within the department, saying: ''Things will be even more confused if we pull FEMA out of D.H.S. and have separate agencies with overlapping or even competing functions.'' But during his speech, he skipped that section of his prepared remarks. Asked about the omission, Russ Knocke, a department spokesman, said it was not unusual for Mr. Chertoff to ''stray a bit from prepared remarks,'' adding, ''I wouldn't read anything into that.'' In Washington on Wednesday, Republicans and Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee released a statement saying that FEMA should remain within the Department of Homeland Security. Some members of Congress are pushing for legislation to restore FEMA's independence, but the committee members objected. ''There's not doubt that FEMA needs to be improved,'' the statement said, ''but removing the agency from D.H.S. is clearly not the answer.''"
"To hear the National Hurricane Center tell it, the 2006 hurricane season, which ends Tuesday, was average. Nine Atlantic storms were robust enough to be named, near the average of 11, said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist at the center in Miami. Five of them became hurricanes, he said, one fewer than the typical number, and as in an ordinary year, two of those were major storms. But no hurricanes struck the United States. Among the named storms, Alberto hit the Florida Panhandle in June, Beryl skimmed Nantucket in July and Ernesto made a feeble swipe at south Florida in August, Mr. Feltgen said, but all were classified as tropical storms, with winds below hurricane strength of 74 miles an hour. After the devastation of 2004 and 2005, the 2006 season has come as a relief. ''It's been wonderful,'' said Stephen P. Leatherman, who directs the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University in Miami. ''We needed a break.'' He and other hurricane researchers attribute the lull in storm activity in large part to two weather patterns. One was the Bermuda High, a zone of high atmospheric pressure that sat this summer unusually far out in the Atlantic, steering storms north, away from the United States. The other was wind shear produced when high-level winds from the Pacific encounter storms moving across the Atlantic toward the United States. This wind shear can interfere with hurricane formation. ''There was a fair bit of wind shear over the Atlantic,'' said Kerry Emanuel, a climate expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The researchers said it would be unwise to draw any conclusions about long-term patterns from this year's non-events. ''We are still on a high cycle'' of hurricane activity, Dr. Leatherman said. Anyway, with hurricanes ''the message is prepare, prepare, prepare,'' Mr. Feltgen said. ''Even if it is a below-normal season for everybody, if that one storm comes through your backyard, it's a bad year for you.'' CORNELIA DEAN The Basics Correction: November 5, 2006, Sunday An article last Sunday about the absence of hurricanes in the United States this year gave an incorrect date for the end of the hurricane season. It is Nov. 30, not Oct. 31."
"Using a formula based on storm intensity, flooding potential, population, evacuation routes and other factors, coastal scientists at Florida International University have determined, ''to nobody's surprise,'' that New Orleans has the top spot on the list of East Coast and Gulf Coast areas most vulnerable to loss of life and property damage in hurricanes. But their second choice is far less obvious: Lake Okeechobee, Fla. Few people can recall what happened in 1928 when a hurricane sloshed the lake's water into a powerful surge that broke the earthen dike around it. As many as 2,500 people died in the resulting flood, most of them impoverished farm workers. The hurricane remains the second deadliest ever in the United States -- only the 1900 hurricane that killed about 6,000 people in Galveston, Tex., was worse. The Army Corps of Engineers rebuilt the dike, naming it for Herbert Hoover, then the president. It is a massive affair, 140 miles long, 45 feet high in places and up to 150 feet wide at its base. It is part of the extensive system of levees, canals and other engineering that turned the lake's ancient watercourse to the Everglades into farmland. But many worry whether the dike can stand up to an assault from a hurricane. ''It's an accident waiting to happen,'' said Stephen P. Leatherman, who directs the International Hurricane Research Center at the university, where the new analysis was produced. He and his colleagues estimate that 40,000 people live near enough to the dike to be threatened. If it breaks, Dr. Leatherman said, ''thousands of people are going to drown again.'' In another study, an expert panel commissioned by the South Florida Water Management District reported that the dike did ''not meet current dam safety criteria,'' and repair work that is under way or scheduled would not be enough to ensure its stability. The panel said the area of maximum concern is a 68-mile stretch centered on the town of Belle Glade, along the south shore. In its report, issued in May, the panel said the pace of repairs should be accelerated. The experts said additional steps should be taken to protect the dike against seepage-related erosion that has plagued it for years, and from wave action and storm surges, the forces that breached it in 1928. The panel recommended lowering the water levels in the lake until repairs are complete, storing emergency repair materials near the dike and updating and rehearsing evacuation plans for the area. Dr. Leatherman said of his research, ''Our report shows how big the storm surge gets in that lake.'' ''The lake is 60 miles across and very shallow -- those are the ingredients for a surge'' if it is swept by hurricane winds, Dr. Leatherman continued. Land outside the dike is low lying, he said, so ''if it breaks, it will be like a wall of water.'' The storm surge analysis is expected to be reported in The Journal of Coastal Research, said Dr. Leatherman, who also coordinated a review of a National Academy of Sciences report on the levee failures in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The formula used by Dr. Leatherman's group for assessing likely impacts relies on hurricane frequency and intensity, levee and dike vulnerability, storm surge and flooding potential, erosion trends, island breaching history, population estimates, evacuation distance and routes, and local and state response capacity. There are a few other surprises on the hurricane vulnerability list. Florida dominates the list, which ''was to be expected,'' the researchers said. But eastern New York, where hurricane strikes are unusual, ranks eighth, ahead of the Tampa-St. Petersburg area and the Florida Panhandle, both of which regularly have close encounters with powerful storms. Dr. Leatherman said that given the historical record, the East End of Long Island is ''overdue'' for a major hurricane, like the storm that devastated the island and New England in 1938. But if such a storm strikes today, he said, it will be even more costly. On Long Island, he said, ''real estate values are so high, if it is hit there are going to be astronomical losses.'' On the plus side, he said, building codes have been strengthened since 1938, and New York has ''a pretty good emergency management system.'' But he points to the fragile sandy barriers on the island's south shore that were battered in the storm. ''Now there are mansions there,'' he said."
"Even as profits on home insurance are soaring, some of the nation's big insurers are turning to Washington in a bid to gain protection against future catastrophic losses. The two biggest companies, Allstate and State Farm, which provide nearly 35 percent of the insurance on American homes, are seeking legislation that would offer the same kind of program for hurricanes and other natural disasters as the government now promises to provide to commercial insurers in a future terrorism attack. The details are still being worked out, but the insurers and their supporters in Congress are talking about state and federal support kicking in after the industry has paid the first $4.5 billion in damage, compared with the first $25 billion in a terror attack. Three Florida lawmakers -- two Republicans and a Democrat -- have introduced federal legislation that would greatly reduce the risk for home insurers and, they say, make insurance on homes in vulnerable areas more affordable and more available. But opponents, including a number of other insurance companies, say that the government should not be in the business of bailing out insurance companies for their losses and that any such program would mostly benefit homeowners along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts at the expense of residents elsewhere in the country. They argue that lowering premiums may send the wrong signal to people on the coasts and encourage further construction in vulnerable areas, resulting in higher payouts for insurance and disaster relief. ''People should understand the risk they face,'' said Julie A. Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association, a large industry group. The industry managed to handle $61.8 billion in losses from Hurricane Katrina and other storms in 2005 and to come back strong this year with record earnings in the first nine months. But the insurers say that was only because they have been pushing up prices along the coasts and reducing their potential losses by refusing to renew policies or to sell new coverage to hundreds of thousands of homeowners along the coasts. The insurers say they also have been doing exceptionally well on auto insurance and investment gains. And they have had a stroke of luck. After a streak of heavy storm activity, this year was strikingly mild for hurricanes. Not one hurricane has hit the United States and none are expected before the season ends on Nov. 30. But insurers say that they cannot count on such good fortune in future years. It is not clear how much momentum the legislation has. The two Republican sponsors in the House -- Ginny Brown-Waite, from a small town near the gulf coast of Florida, and E. Clay Shaw Jr. from south Florida -- have the endorsement of 30 colleagues, including 12 Democrats. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat who is a former Florida insurance commissioner, has introduced matching legislation in the Senate. The elections in November could shift control of at least one house of Congress to the Democrats. But Allstate and its allies say support for the program is growing in both parties. The lawmakers supporting the legislation say it would provide relief to hundreds of thousands of homeowners in Florida. With no other alternative, the homeowners have had to buy coverage from a state insurance agency that charges above-average prices and provides bare-bones coverage. Allstate and State Farm, which write a big share of the policies for coverage on the coasts, say that without government help their prices will have to go higher and that, to protect themselves, they will be forced to cut back coverage even more on the coasts. But several other insurance companies, which have lighter concentrations of coverage on the coasts and are in less danger of overwhelming losses from hurricanes, say they would rather the government stay out of their business. Those insurers say they prefer to continue trying to persuade state regulators to drop their restraints on pricing and to permit them to keep raising premiums to reflect the accurate potential for losses. The insurers also want to be able to continue to be free to decide whether to provide coverage or not. Some industry experts say the insurers also fear that a drive for federal backing for hurricane insurance could backfire and threaten the terrorism insurance program. It is scheduled to expire at the end of 2007 and needs Congressional endorsement to continue. Many companies sell both commercial and home insurance. Under a federal hurricane insurance program, insurers would probably be forced to offer coverage to everyone, no matter how high the risk of major claims, as is required under the program on terrorism insurance. Speaking against federal hurricane coverage, Joseph Annotti, a spokesman for a trade group with more than 1,000 insurance companies as members, said, ''We generally favor a free-market approach.'' Allstate is the largest member of Mr. Annotti's organization, the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. But Mr. Annotti said the association differed with Allstate on this issue. Insurance industry experts said a handful of other large insurance companies with many policies on the coasts were considering joining the appeal for federal assistance. But so far none have taken a stand publicly. Michael J. Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate, said high profits this year were no reason not to seek federal assistance. ''One good year of profitability,'' he said, ''is not enough to overcome the huge effects that a mega-catastrophe can inflict on companies.'' State Farm, in its pitch for the legislation, argues that private insurance is designed to cover fires and smaller storms, rather than hurricanes like Katrina that can inflict heavy losses in several states over a few days. To protect the solvency of the insurers and their ability to provide coverage throughout the country, a new approach is needed, State Farm said. ''The government needs to address this,'' said Jeff McCollum, a spokesman for State Farm. The federal program would have two parts: insurance pools or funds created in the states and a central fund in Washington. Money would come from the insurers to create the state funds and the insurers' costs would be recovered through a surcharge on homeowners. The state funds would channel much of the money they received to the federal fund. In a disaster, the insurers would pay the first several billion in damage. Then the state fund would kick in and begin sharing costs. At a certain level, the state fund would begin receiving money for further damages from the central fund. The program's backers say that unlike the financially troubled national flood program, it would not borrow money from the Treasury. Instead, they say, it would have the authority to issue bonds to finance losses beyond its resources. The flood insurance program borrowed nearly $25 billion from the government after Hurricane Katrina and industry experts say the money will probably never be repaid. Under the proposal, the bonds for hurricane coverage would be backed by the government. J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, warned that after a series of catastrophic hurricanes and earthquakes, the program still might not be able to repay the bonds. ''Then it ends up being paid for by taxpayers,'' he said. Backers of federal support for the insurers have signed up James Lee Witt, a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as a co-chairman of an organization in Washington to lobby for the federal insurance program. The other co-chairman of the group, called Protecting America, is Adm. James M. Loy, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Edmund F. Kelly, the chief executive of the Liberty Mutual Group, another large provider of home insurer, has been lobbying to get the federal program on terrorism insurance extended beyond its expiration date at the end of next year. But he opposes federal assistance on hurricane insurance, arguing that it is unneeded. ''There is no reliable data on the risk of terrorism for different potential targets,'' Mr. Kelly said. But ''substantial historical data on natural catastrophes exists, which helps companies understand and manage their exposure to large risks.''"
"Insurance companies are expecting record profits in 2006 after predictions of another year of devastating hurricanes have so far come to naught. Industry experts are estimating that profits may reach $60 billion, on a combination of higher premiums along the coasts, no major payouts for natural disasters and strong investment returns. The insurers also had high profits on other lines of coverage like auto insurance, workers compensation and general liability. The record profits expected this year come after a terrible 2005, when insurers paid out $61 billion for damage from Hurricane Katrina and other storms. Even so, the insurers ended up with a profit of $43 billion for the year because of exceptionally good results on investments, declining claims on policies on homes away from the coast and profits on other lines of coverage. But homeowners and businesses along the coasts, hit with much higher insurance costs after the barrage of hurricanes, probably will not get any relief as a result of the much quieter season, industry experts and consumer advocates said. The hurricane season lasts another seven weeks, until Nov. 30, but no one is expecting any costly storms. ''We're fairly confident that the chances of a cataclysmic hurricane this year are behind us,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute. ''And we think we're going to have some good numbers.'' The expected record profit this year will add momentum to a decades-long earnings streak, interrupted by only one annual loss -- $7 billion in 2001, when the Sept. 11 attacks staggered the insurers. Reinsurance companies -- the sometimes obscure insurers that back up the most familiar name brands in insurance by selling them coverage to share the risks -- are also expected to do exceptionally well in 2006. So will investors like hedge funds that began providing capital directly to insurers when they saw premiums along the coast climbing. As the hurricane season began in June, the price of insurance stocks dipped. But the stocks began to come alive in August as some investors sensed that ''this season was not going to be a disaster, nothing like last year,'' said Adam Klauber, an analyst at Cochran Caronia Waller, an investment banking firm in Chicago. The stocks are up an average of 12 percent since mid-August, Mr. Klauber said. Shares of Allstate, one of the biggest home insurers along the coasts, have jumped 13 percent in that period, closing at $62.93 yesterday. Shares of Renaissance Re, one of the largest companies providing catastrophe coverage for big insurers like Allstate and Chubb, have risen 17 percent, to close at $56.03 yesterday. Insurers raised premiums on homes and businesses along the coasts by as much as 10 times over last year's rates after a series of powerful hurricanes last year and in 2004 and forecasts of perhaps half a dozen major storms this year. Complete industry results for 2006 will not be available until early next year. But based on data so far, Mr. Hartwig is estimating profits of $55 billion to $60 billion. Jim Auden, who helps direct research and analysis of the industry at Fitch Ratings, a Chicago concern that tracks the financial strength of companies, estimated profits at $60 billion. The industry's optimism stems from an updated forecast this month from the University of Colorado that predicts no more than one mild hurricane in October and no hurricanes at all next month. But owners of coastal homes and businesses should not expect any easing of their insurance costs. ''Just because there wasn't a major storm this year, doesn't mean there won't be one next year or the year after,'' Mr. Auden said. ''Certain coastal markets are probably still underpriced.'' Consumer advocates, on the other hand, are crying foul. ''It's unfair,'' said J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of American. ''They have overestimated their losses and vastly overpriced. And now, when the money rolls in, there is no relief for consumers.'' Mr. Hunter, a former insurance commissioner in Texas, said he and other regulators agreed to sharp price increases after Hurricane Andrew devastated a swath of Florida south of Miami in 1992. The insurers agreed then, he said, to base their prices on long-term averages for damage. After the powerful storms in 2004 and 2005, many insurers shortened their projections. ''If you're going to use a shorter time frame,'' Mr. Hunter said, ''you've got to lower rates when profits are good. You can't just go up when it's bad and stay there.'' Two University of Colorado forecasters, Philip J. Klotzbach and William M. Gray, said that an abrupt shift in El Niño, a periodic warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that can stifle hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, interrupted a cycle of favorable conditions for hurricanes expected to run for another decade or so. By hurricane season next year, the university forecasters expect the El Niño conditions to be gone. The insurers do not compile financial results by region, including the narrow strip of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts most threatened by hurricanes. In most of the country, away from the coasts, claims on home insurance have been falling, said Jeff Reider, president of the Ward Group, a national insurance consulting firm in Cincinnati. Many customers have stopped filing for minor damage, fearing that their policies might be canceled or that, at the least, their rates would rise, he said. Over all, the insurers are expecting profits on their fundamental business of collecting premiums and paying claims -- underwriting -- to jump from a loss of $5.9 billion last year to a profit of $27 billion this year. For 2006, Mr. Hartwig is forecasting a 12 percent dip in investment profits. But at $51 billion before taxes, those investment earnings would be among the industry's better results over the last decade. In most years, the insurers have lost money on underwriting and made their profits on gains from investing premiums until needed to pay claims. The insurers have been raising prices sharply since the terrorist attacks in 2001. As a result, their underwriting losses declined from $52.6 billion in 2001 to $4.9 billion in 2003. In 2004, the insurers made a $4.3 billion profit on underwriting but reported the underwriting loss in 2005. This year, Mr. Hartwig said after paying an estimated $24 billion in taxes the industry's net profit might rise to $60 billion. Correction: October 27, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day on Oct. 14 about expectations by insurance companies for record profits for 2006, in part because of few major claim payouts for natural disasters, misidentified the source of an updated forecast that predicted no more than one mild hurricane in October and no hurricanes at all next month. It was from Colorado State University, not the University of Colorado."
"A pair of storm systems moved across the Southeast yesterday, giving rise to at least 12 tornadoes, fierce winds and torrential rainfall that killed at least one person and injured dozens in four states, National Weather Service officials said. Three of the injured were preschool children who were among 31 children and four adults who survived after a tornado demolished the building that housed the Lambert Learning Center, a day care center in Montgomery, Ala. Hearing tornado sirens, a teacher at the center moved the group into a sheltered area below a floor of offices, the only space that was not flattened when the storm tore through the building, which also houses a skating rink. The rink was not in use. ''We were fortunate that these systems were pretty well forecast, pretty well advertised,'' said Tom Bradshaw, a meteorologist with the Southern Regional Headquarters of the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. ''That probably minimized the loss of life.'' A man was killed after a tornado struck his mobile home near Greensburg, La., said Bill Doran, chief of operations for the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. In other areas, winds and tornadoes slung big trucks across Interstate 40 in Arkansas, seriously injuring a driver who had to be cut from the cab of his overturned 18-wheeler, said Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. Rescuers also plucked several people out of flash-flood waters there, Mr. Harris said. ''We thought we dodged the bullet with no hurricanes and no tropical storms this year,'' said Susan Severance, the acting chief of staff in the Louisiana emergency preparedness office. ''I think we may have spoken too soon.''"
"AT Caltech's annual Q. and A. for parents of new freshmen, the first question from the audience was electric with anxiety. ''In the event of a catastrophe, how would I communicate with my child?'' It was a post-Katrina question. Images of students at Xavier University of Louisiana, trapped atop a dormitory in New Orleans surrounded by floodwaters, were vivid. No phones. No power. Dwindling food supplies. Makeshift caravans evacuating students. A parent's newest nightmare. The panel fielded the questions with admirable calm. ''We have satellite phones. Also, the California Institute of Technology has the best ham/amateur radio club in America.'' Staff members ran through a checklist: three-day supply of food, one week of potable water, designated off-campus sites for tent cities. The parent hadn't bothered to specify the disaster, but since this was Southern California it could have been wildfire, riot or quake. ''Two members of our faculty invented the Richter scale. We set the standards in earthquake engineering. I can guarantee that this building will still be standing after a Northridge-scale quake. It might be two or three feet to one side, but it will still be standing.'' I admit to being caught off guard by the question. Disaster preparedness had not been a category in any of the college guidebooks we had consulted, nor had it come up during campus tours. The contingencies we had planned for in sending our daughter to college (linens, laptop, cellphone) suddenly seemed naïve, if not negligent. Should we have included a gas-powered generator and water purification tablets? What had I overlooked? When I got home I downloaded the 25- page Caltech disaster response plan. I have no idea what a mercury sniffer is, what decontamination pillows do, or how to judge the protocols for dealing with a chemical spill of, say, ethidium bromide. But I was reassured. Sure. I Googled the terms ''emergency response plan and university'' and got some 15 million results. I read, oh, about half of them. Colleges have plans for everything. Some provide forms for operators to fill in when dealing with a bomb threat (ask the caller when, where, what kind of bomb, what it looks like and why). Others provide cue cards and bullhorns, scripting what is to be read aloud at peaceful demonstrations, or violent ones. Colleges on the West Coast plan for earthquakes. (The standard advice, to take shelter in a doorway, is apparently obsolete. Better to ''duck-cover-hold.'') Those on the Gulf and the southeastern coasts have protocols for hurricanes. The University of Oklahoma tells its students what to do during a twister (run away at an angle, Dorothy). Liberty University, Jerry Falwell's evangelical campus in Lynchburg, Va., cautions in its statement of liability that it is not responsible for damage caused by wind, water, insects, rodents, vandalism or theft. Buy insurance. The Web site's doctrinal statement predicts that Armageddon is imminent. For the Rapture, consult the Bible. New England plans for terrorist acts, pandemics and severe weather. The online edition of The Yale Daily News, for example, reported that shortly after 9/11 the university participated in a tabletop exercise to test New Haven's bioterrorism preparedness. (The same page had a teaser about students posing for something called ''Barely Legal,'' but I remained on task. One anxiety at a time, please.) Many campuses developed formal plans only after 9/11. ''It was a wake-up call,'' Joe Wrinn, Harvard's director of the office of news and public affairs, told me. ''If you read Bob Woodward's 'Bush at War,' you know why. Mr. Bush asked his staff to 'place your bets' on the next most likely terrorist targets. Guess who's No. 7 on the list? Harvard.'' There was no hard intelligence to support the choice, but what do you expect? Mr. Bush is a Yalie. Mr. Wrinn outlined Harvard's response plan. ''The university has three situation rooms, and runs regular tabletop exercises,'' he said. ''What would we do if bird flu struck? You have to be aware, practiced in your thinking. It's managed common sense. Even for something as simple as a snow day, you have to have a plan. Beyond taking care of students, faculty and staff, you have to ask about lab animals, cell lines that represent a lifetime of research. Who will feed them?'' Hurricane Andrew provided the impetus for the University of Miami, damaging 52 roofs, breaking 800 windows, uprooting 1,300 trees, and sending its primate-lab residents scampering down Coral Reef Drive. Classes were delayed more than two weeks. Miami's plan evolves with each crisis. ''There is no such thing as a perfect disaster plan,'' Donna Shalala, the university president, explained. She detailed some of the solutions developed during last year's hurricane season: ''The food service staff slept on campus to feed students. The school held talent shows and movie festivals to keep students entertained, and off the streets.'' Even day care contingency plans are in place, since city school systems shut down. Above all, the plan emphasizes communication with parents. During Hurricane Wilma, the university's emergency response Web site got 187,000 hits. Its toll-free rumor-control hot line logged 16,454 calls. Stanford, which was almost wiped off the planet by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, didn't take the threat seriously until the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 . It subsequently spent $250 million on earthquake amelioration. For example, Stanford now stores food in pods scattered around campus, instead of in buildings that could be reduced to rubble. Oddly, the University of Washington in Seattle, which fields a FEMA-sponsored Campus Emergency Response Team, does not stockpile rations. Robert Roseth, director of news and information, explained: ''We've gone more to fresh food. We hired a French chef to head food services, and he insists on working with fresh food.'' The university does sell 72-hour survival packs (filled with flashlights, blankets, and M.R.E.'s -- meals ready to eat) at the student union for a mere $21. Mr. Roseth said that the 72-hour figure is a disaster response mantra. ''Seattle has pretty much told us that in the event of a quake we are on our own for the first three days,'' he said. After Katrina, the university revised that figure upward -- to two weeks. Every campus I contacted had studied the events in New Orleans. Among the lessons learned: 1) Under eight feet of water neither the Internet nor phones work. Tulane got high marks for setting up communication centers outside the disaster area. All the institutions found hosts for mirror Web sites. 2) You can't count on help from local or federal authorities. Xavier asked Southern University and A.&M. College, at Baton Rouge, and Grambling State University to send buses to rescue its stranded students. 3) Colleges compete with the community for scarce resources. (The National Guard had to protect the convoy from hurricane victims who tried to storm the buses.) And finally: Recovery is a long and agonizing process. I was reassured by my survey, and fully appreciated the irony. In the 60's, as a student, I had fought against the concept of in loco parentis. Now I welcomed it. I cannot micromanage a flood or an earthquake. The most I can ask for is managed common sense. Separated from my daughter by about 1,700 miles, I want the university as a partner on the ground. She returned from her freshman year in one piece, enthusiastic and focused. She scoffed at my concern. Oh, she had survived her share of crises. When M.I.T. pranksters stole the Fleming House cannon, she had worked the command center for 48 hours straight, talking to alumni and members of the media, monitoring Caltech's successful cross-country recovery effort. The cannon was back. If worse comes to worse, my daughter can defend herself. Her house has a fully operational cannon. NOTEBOOK James R. Petersen is a former senior writer and editor at Playboy."
"We are cheered to see that the American Red Cross is making a concerted effort to reform itself. The organization has been criticized for its checkered response to Hurricane Katrina. But the United States relies on this charitable institution to be a key pillar in our nation's disaster-relief plan. It is in all our interests to see the Red Cross fix its problems. Reducing its unwieldy 50-member board to no more than 20 members is the right step -- although we would prefer it happen before the proposed 2012 deadline. Congress, which oversees the organization, should approve this and other governance changes when it returns from the election recess. The proposed changes would help to modernize management and oversight. The 125-year-old institution has a convoluted structure, which includes nearly 800 local chapters and 35 regional divisions for handling the country's blood supply. Such a complex organization needs strong leadership. Right now it is not clear who is in charge. The Congressional charter refers to the chairman -- a presidential appointee -- as the Red Cross's ''principal officer.'' That undercuts the ability of the chief executive -- a professional manager -- to lead. It is probably no coincidence that the Red Cross has been without a permanent chief executive since last December. The proposed reforms would clarify the lines of authority and empower the chief executive, by removing the chairman's ''principal officer'' designation. The chairman and board should instead focus on oversight and long-term strategy. After Hurricane Katrina, critics faulted the Red Cross for its often slow reaction and its inability to anticipate basic needs. While these governance changes would not directly affect its disaster response, they would help attract the kind of leadership that could make operations run more smoothly. Had the federal government's response to Katrina been more competent, the Red Cross's missteps would have been less noticeable and less worrying. Americans believe in the Red Cross. Donors sent over $2 billion to the organization for relief efforts tied to last year's destructive hurricane season. It needs to do more to merit that trust. And it needs to repair itself quickly. No one knows when or where the next major disaster will strike. Editorial"
"PLANTING a tree may seem like a simple act, but its benefits are complex. Beyond the usual effects -- providing shade, reducing erosion and the like -- replacing trees destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita along the Gulf Coast will have another, less tangible impact, said Joe Baucum, the volunteer president of the Louisiana Urban Forest Council and a retired health administrator. ''When people came back, they were devastated by the loss of landmarks and familiar landscapes,'' he said. ''Planting will bring a semblance of normality, a sense of harmony and home and security. I expect it'll have a major impact on the psychology of the area.'' The New Orleans-area organization Friends of Jefferson the Beautiful, which is also led by Mr. Baucum, expects to work with public agencies to plant some 1,300 oaks, red swamp maple, crepe myrtle and other species this fall on public property in Jefferson Parish, west of the city. The group had to wait a year for the debris to be cleared and for consensus on where to plant first. Their efforts were supported, in part, by a $15,000 grant from American Forests (americanforests.org), which also awarded grants to three other groups working on restoring Gulf Coast trees. American Forests, founded in 1875 and based in Washington, is committed to planting trees both for general environmental purposes and after natural disasters, whether floods, hurricanes or wildfires. The group funnels about $3 million in grants yearly to organizations planting trees on public lands in the United States, and spends about 10 percent of its budget on international projects. American Forests has 25,000 members, who provide a third of its financial support; the rest comes from corporate donations and foundation and government sources. The combined momentum of the national beautification program undertaken in the 1960s and the modern environmental movement of the early 1970s helped create local and regional organizations responsible for planting -- and just as important, maintaining -- trees. Several Web sites, including treelink.org and actrees.org, list groups active around the country. One of the oldest and most innovative groups, TreePeople (treepeople.org), was founded more than 30 years ago in Los Angeles and has planted two million trees on school campuses, street medians and in the mountains above the city. Other groups built on similar principles include Casey Trees in Washington; the Cross Timbers Urban Forestry Council in Fort Worth; Neighborwoods in Rochester, Minn.; and the Massachusetts Urban Forestry Council in Boston. Andy Lipkis, founder of TreePeople, emphasized that planting trees in densely populated areas could be a waste of resources unless they receive follow-up attention, which also requires financial support. ''Every time the money goes away, trees we've planted die,'' he said. ''Trees planted in cities tend not to live by themselves. People need to determine whether their local group has a maintenance program.'' Some local tree-planting organizations have taken on special missions. The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation (ftpf.org), started in Mill Valley, Calif., in 2002 by the raw food advocate and author David Wolfe, is dedicated to planting orchards in places where they can serve poor populations, either as a food source or as a catalyst for educational programs or both. The foundation has financed projects in India, in Pennsylvania (at an animal sanctuary) and in Southern California (at drug rehabilitation centers and an American Indian reservation). Two months ago, the group planted 32 trees, including orange, lemon, peach, guava and mulberry, adjacent to two elementary schools in the National School District in National City, Calif., just north of the Mexican border. Clint Taylor, who coordinates before- and after-school programs for the district, said the children were being taught to care for the three-year-old trees, which will begin to bear fruit in a couple of years. He said the district planned to incorporate the orchard into a nutritional program to help the school's primarily Hispanic students develop better eating habits. ''These are urban children who live in an extremely poor area and don't get exposed to gardening or fruit trees,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''They'll have an opportunity to harvest the fruit, donate it to food banks or homeless shelters or use it for in-school fund-raising.'' The actual price tag of planting a tree can vary greatly depending on its location and continuing needs. A donation of as little as $1 can cover the cost of a seedling in a bulk planting in wilder areas, said American Forests' executive director, Deborah Gangloff. American Forests helps pay for that kind of planting annually in the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge in southern Texas. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service supervises the reforestation of cleared farmland bought by the federal government to increase the amount of protected land along the river. In late October, 800 volunteers helped refuge staff members plant 14,000 ebony, mesquite and other seedlings on a 50-acre field in southwestern Hidalgo County. More than 130,000 seedlings have been planted in the refuge over the last 15 years. The wooded areas provide a vital habitat for native birds and wildcats like the ocelot. Humberto Rodriguez, the park ranger who coordinated this year's planting, said the former private landowners who sold to the government often stayed in residence to help nurse the seedlings through the first year. ''Then we let Mother Nature take its course,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''We've had a tremendous survival rate.'' As for the other end of the cost spectrum, Mr. Lipkis cautioned that the true cost of planting a tree in an urban setting can easily run to more than $100, including its early care. Trees planted in cities must be more mature than in natural areas, with thicker trunks -- the general rule is a 1 1/2- inch minimum diameter at the base -- so it can thrive in harsher conditions posed by impure air, water and soil. But, he said, ''You get a lot of climate change bang for your buck with an urban tree.'' Corporate support for tree-planting organizations has increased in recent years, administrators say. Ikea and Coleman Natural Foods are among several companies working with American Forests, while Home Depot is one of TreePeople's partners. But the groups still rely heavily on individual donors, and build campaigns to appeal to them. TreePeople runs an annual holiday dedication program in which contributors can plant a single tree for $25 or a grove of five trees for $100 in honor of a loved one. American Forests sells trees descended from pin oaks and weeping willows at Elvis Presley's estate at Graceland, and ginkgos grown from cuttings taken from a tree that stood in front of Frank Lloyd Wright's historic home in Oak Park, Ill. The organization also sponsors tree-planting projects intended to protect tigers in Siberia and monarch butterflies in Mexico. ''We often joke that trees don't have eyeballs, but the species they support do,'' Ms. Gangloff said. ''We want to help everyone relate to trees.'' ENVIRONMENT"
"Players at South Plaquemines High taped their ankles by the blue and red lights of a police car. Coach Cyril Crutchfield studied his game plan by the white lights of another sheriff's cruiser. Inside a makeshift dressing room, linebacker Sal Cepriano adjusted his helmet visor in the pale glow of two cellphones. Exterior lights from an ambulance provided illumination for the ticket booth. As the team warmed up at dusk on Friday for a playoff game here, the stadium lights faltered. Music on the sound system slurred to a halt. A backhoe had hit a power line in the area, and electricity went out for nearly two hours along a stretch of Highway 23. Players retreated from the evening chill to the warmth of the mobile office that served as a dressing room. They spread out on the floor, resting on equipment bags and shoulder pads. Lying quietly in the dark, they resembled evacuees from a more turbulent maelstrom, the one they survived 14 1/2 months ago when Hurricane Katrina roared through. Devin Boutwell, a defensive lineman, admonished his teammates to remain calm. Still, some grew impatient. Occasionally, someone shouted a curse. Guard Dwayne Ancar paced the floor and pounded one wall with his gloved hands. ''We're ready to go,'' Ancar said. ''This is taking too long.'' Finally the game began, more than an hour late. From the beginning, newly formed South Plaquemines appeared flat, drained of energy and resolve in what wound up as a 48-16 defeat to Clinton. The Hurricanes lined up incorrectly on offense and forgot to call defensive signals. They tackled poorly, fumbled twice and threw five interceptions in a loss that ended a season of hope, perseverance and, ultimately, frustration. Perhaps South Plaquemines (5-7) was simply overmatched Friday. Maybe players were emotionally spent after a stunning playoff comeback a week earlier, or satisfied with simply reaching the playoffs after a difficult season played without a locker room and a weight room, or even a home field for all but one regular-season game and one playoff game. ''With everything that they've been through, when something bad happens, they put their heads down,'' Crutchfield said of his team's fragile confidence. After the game, the sophomore quarterback Ridge Turner lay on his back in despair. The team's seniors took the defeat particularly hard. Once rivals, they had come together from the devastated communities of Port Sulphur, Buras and Boothville-Venice. Now their careers were over, and they were facedown on the field or sitting disconsolately, their shoulders heaving as they sobbed. Their parents approached and urged them to their feet. Mike Barthelemy Sr., whose son, Mike Jr., is an eighth-grade linebacker, walked among the players and said: ''Thank every one of you. It took a lot of courage to come back and play. You've been through a hell of a lot. I'm proud of everyone.'' Crutchfield, the coach, was too distraught to address his team. He stood with his hands on his hips, staring into the distance. Later, in the dressing room, he put his head down on a table, then pulled his shirt to his face and cried softly. He had won a state championship at Port Sulphur High in 2002 and was accustomed to playing regularly beyond Thanksgiving. ''What am I going to do?'' he said vacantly. For the seniors, time had also run out. Boutwell had wanted to graduate in lower Plaquemines, as close as possible to his destroyed home in Buras. But after returning for the playoffs from what he believed to be a career-ending knee injury in September, Boutwell said he would probably transfer to Ponchatoula High School, northwest of New Orleans. There, he would work with an athletic trainer as he continues to rehabilitate his knee. He still hoped to receive an athletic scholarship or an invitation to play in college as a walk-on. ''I can't work out down here; there's no facilities, no nothing,'' Boutwell said. Still, he added, he had no regrets about returning to lower Plaquemines for his senior season. ''Home is where the heart is,'' Boutwell said. ''I think we pulled out a lot more wins than anybody thought we would.'' Just opening the school was an achievement that many believed was impossible, said Stanley Gaudet, the principal at South Plaquemines. ''Most people expected us to fall flat on our faces,'' Gaudet said. Yet the future holds no answers, only questions. Even the permanent location of South Plaquemines High School is not expected to be decided for several years. For now, it is situated in temporary buildings on the ruined campus of Port Sulphur High. There is no usable gym, so the boys' and girls' basketball teams must travel 23 miles south to Boothville for practice. Players who live in northern Plaquemines, or in greater New Orleans, will have to travel 60 or more miles home each evening. Wrestling has started, too, but the team trains in a makeshift cafeteria, moving tables to one side of the room and unfurling mats on the other. The school has adequate textbooks and supplies, Gaudet said. But there are not enough books in some subjects for students to take home. ''Every time I ask for a pencil, they start fussing,'' said Maverick Ancar, an eighth-grade defensive back. Irregular signs of recovery are evident in lower Plaquemines, where Katrina struck with 120-mile-an-hour winds and a 28-foot storm surge, damaging or destroying almost every structure, stranding barges atop levees and depositing boats on the highway. Coffins popped out of the ground and cows were left hanging by their necks in trees. Many businesses in Port Sulphur have returned or are rebuilding. Since the football season began, the post office has opened and some streetlights have been installed on Highway 23, the only road in and out of this narrow peninsula. Thirteen miles south in Buras, though, almost no evidence of recovery exists. There is no longer any school there. And, according to Roger Halphen, an assistant football coach and head wrestling coach at South Plaquemines who lived in Buras before Katrina, hope for its future was dwindling. ''They're killing my town,'' Halphen said, echoing others. ''Sometimes, you feel like giving up. When people you were born and raised with don't come back, you feel pretty lonely.'' At least wrestling would provide welcome distraction until February. By then, he said, people might have more answers about recovery money and flood insurance. Last week, Louisiana's governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, criticized the slow pace of the state's recovery process, saying that only 27 of about 120,000 eligible families had received home-rebuilding grants, worth up to $150,000 apiece, under the Road Home program. Many students at South Plaquemines continue to live in FEMA trailer parks, both near the school and as far as 30 miles away. ''It's time to get people in full-size trailers and permanent housing because of the stress,'' Billy Nungesser, the newly elected parish president, told The Plaquemines Gazette. The geographic vulnerability of lower Plaquemines is also striking, particularly at South Plaquemines High, which sits on a thin strip of land, not a half-mile wide, between the Mississippi River and marshes that lead to the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government has said it will not immediately spend the $1.6 billion needed to fully fortify levees at the lower end of the parish, because so few people have returned. A state plan would also not provide lower Plaquemines any greater protection than before Katrina, according to news accounts. Meanwhile, serious talk has been revived, by scientists and state officials, of diverting the Mississippi in lower Plaquemines so it can deposit vital silt and restore the shriveling coastline, where continued erosion of marshland has shrunk what served as a natural hurricane buffer. Such a contentious plan has fostered two local reactions -- dismissal for its seeming impracticality and fear that that the lower parish would be abandoned, disturbing vital industries of fishing and oil and gas and again uprooting residents who have just begun to rebuild from Katrina. This fear mirrors a general apprehension that, in the words of Gaudet, the South Plaquemines principal, ''They won't rebuild the lower community; that they will leave us here and forget about us and not give us everything we need.'' Late Friday night, after he stopped crying, Crutchfield said he would take satisfaction in the spirit of his players, who lost everything in the hurricane, returned here to live in FEMA trailers and traveled 60 miles round-trip to practice each day for weeks, while subsisting at school on ham and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Three months into the school year, the cafeteria is still not operational. ''For the kids to hang in there, they showed tremendous resiliency,'' Crutchfield said, ticking off a list of the season's hardships: the daily travel, the lack of a home field, the combining of three schools into one. Next year, South Plaquemines, with 175 students in grades 9 through 12, will drop from Class 2A to Class 1A and compete in football against Louisiana's smallest schools. Already, the Hurricanes are being considered a favorite to win a state title. ''I think we have a legitimate shot,'' Crutchfield said. FOOTBALL"
"In a series pitting teams whose styles are mirror images, it is only fitting that the N.H.L. Eastern Conference finals will come down to a Game 7. That is because the Buffalo co-captain Daniel Brière beat Carolina's rookie goaltender Cam Ward on a power play at 4 minutes 22 seconds of overtime Tuesday night to give the Sabres a 2-1 victory over the Hurricanes, tying their series at three games apiece. Game 7 is scheduled for Raleigh, N.C., on Thursday night. The winner faces the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup finals. ''Before the game, that's all we were looking for: we wanted a chance at Game 7,'' said Brière, who gave the Sabres just that when he scored his eighth goal of the playoffs with a shot from the left-wing circle. The puck bounced off Ward's catching glove, over the goaltender and past the goal line with six seconds remaining on a controversial boarding penalty against Carolina center Doug Weight. ''He saw me,'' Weight said of the Buffalo rookie right wing Jason Pominville, whom Weight had checked into the corner. ''But I was brought up to take responsibility. It's a bad penalty. It stinks. It's a bad feeling. Do I agree with it? No. I know he sees me. He's turning into me. I'm coming hard to finish my check and he spins with the puck. I can try to miss him and break my neck. ''I guess, unfortunately, over the last eight years, that's turned into a pretty good play in this game. But I should be smarter and see that it's him. He's done it three or four times in the series trying to draw penalties and I should avoid it. So I'm going to have to make amends on Thursday and I plan to do that.'' Pominville said: ''You know what? I never saw him. You turn your back to the play, you're not supposed to hit a guy when his back is turned.'' The younger, less experienced Sabres were tantalizing close in regulation to sending the series back to Carolina when the veteran defenseman Bret Hedican roofed a wrist shot from the top of the left-wing circle past Buffalo goaltender Ryan Miller. Hedican's second goal of the playoffs tied the score at 1-1 and took a little life out of what had been a raucous, if also a tad apprehensive, crowd. There was an air of electricity in HSBC Arena even before the game started because Buffalo defenseman Teppo Numminen took part in a pregame warm-up for the first time since he injured a hip flexor in Game 1. The Sabres had played -- and lost -- Games 4 and 5 without three of their top six defensemen: Numminen, Henrik Tallinder (wrist) and Dmitri Kalinin (ankle). So a big cheer went up when Numminen's name was not announced over the public-address system as among the Sabres' scratches. Another cheer went up the first time Numminen touched the puck. Numminen's comeback was fleeting. He had just 4:13 of ice time and did not play after the first period. That left the Sabres with five healthy defenseman from the second period on, as Buffalo tried to protect the 1-0 lead J. P. Dumont had given it 4:56 into the first period. The Sabres ultimately could not. But as their other co-captain, Chris Drury, said, ''We always just seem to find a way.'' Because Buffalo did Tuesday, it was able to avoid elimination. Now both teams face elimination Thursday. ''Nobody's blind here,'' said Carolina Coach Peter Laviolette, who was incensed that the referees did not call two possible penalties against Buffalo just before the Sabres scored the game-winning goal. ''Everybody knows what's at stake. Now our backs are up against the wall.'' SLAP SHOTS Carolina forward Eric Staal's franchise-record streak of recording at least one point came to an end at 15 games. HOCKEY"
"Convinced that tough tactics are needed, officials in hurricane-prone states are trumpeting dire warnings about the storm season that starts on Thursday, preaching self-reliance and prodding the public to prepare early and well. Cities are circulating storm-preparation checklists, counties are holding hurricane expositions at shopping malls and states are dangling carrots like free home inspections and tax-free storm supplies in hopes of conquering complacency. But the main strategy, it seems, is to scare the multitudes of people who emergency officials say remain blasé even after last year's record-breaking storm season. To persuade residents to heed evacuation orders, the Florida Division of Emergency Management is broadcasting public service announcements with recordings of 911 calls placed during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. ''The roof has completely caved in on us,'' a woman cries as chilling music swells, only to be told that rescuers cannot come out during the storm. Speaking of the tactics, Craig Fugate, Florida's emergency management director, said last week at a news conference in Tallahassee, ''We're going to use a sledgehammer.'' This save-yourselves approach comes after government agencies were overwhelmed by pleas for help after last year's storms and strongly criticized as not responding swiftly or thoroughly enough to the public need. Now, officials have said repeatedly, only the elderly, the poor and the disabled should count on the government to help them escape a hurricane or endure its immediate aftermath. Mississippi, where more than 200 residents died in Hurricane Katrina, unrolled a ''Stay Alert. Stay Alive'' hurricane awareness campaign in April. State officials told residents what to pack in a ''go-kit'' for evacuating (flashlight, radio, nonelectric can opener) and, like many others, commanded them to stockpile at least three days' worth of water and food. Horry County, S.C., home to Myrtle Beach, held a hurricane exposition last month and is giving similar presentations at Kiwanis clubs and homeowners associations. ''The big shortfall is complacency with the community,'' said Randall Webster, director of Horry County Emergency Management. ''Our main theme is, take interest as an individual and make preparations.'' But will it work? Emergency management officials groaned this month at a poll by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc., which found that of 1,100 adults along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, 83 percent had taken no steps to fortify their homes this year, 68 percent had no hurricane survival kits and 60 percent had no family disaster plan. ''I can't rightfully say I see any increased sense of people getting ready,'' said Larry Gispert, emergency management director in Hillsborough County, Fla., home to Tampa. ''It's like a psychological issue -- 'If I don't think about bad things, bad things won't happen.' '' In Nags Head, N.C., Jimmy Austin, a former commercial fisherman who now operates his own seafood market, said he was unfazed by this year's predictions, some of which suggest that the Carolinas will be especially hard hit. He keeps his insurance current, Mr. Austin said, but sees no need for special precautions. ''I don't pay these things a whole lot of mind,'' said Mr. Austin, 69, a native of the Outer Banks. ''Because they say so doesn't mean it's going to happen that way.'' In Galveston, Tex., Keith Patterson, a resident there for 30 years, dismissed the urgency of a hurricane survival kit on Thursday. No use worrying about a hurricane until it is near, he said. ''When one is coming, I'll make preparations,'' said Mr. Patterson, 68, a retired purchasing clerk. ''I'll get what I have to get then.'' In Florida, the second annual tax holiday on hurricane supplies, from May 21 through June 1, has not drawn an overwhelming response, several store representatives said. But at least one store, the Lowe's in South Fort Myers, was selling more generators than barbecue grills last week, said John Sandford, operations manager there. At a Home Depot, Brenda and Jerry Dyche of South Fort Myers were shopping for a generator last Wednesday. With that and a new roof, they said, they had no reason to flee. ''We'd just as soon be in our house,'' Mr. Dyche said. ''Where are we going to go? I-75 is a parking lot by the time they evacuate everybody.'' Likewise, Ronda Burke, who did not go inland last year to avoid Hurricane Rita but stayed on South Padre Island, Tex., to watch over her new health food cafe, Naturally's, said she would probably do the same this year if necessary. ''We feel about our store like you feel about a person,'' said Ms. Burke, whose husband took their two young children to higher ground as Hurricane Rita neared the Texas coast (and eventually came ashore far from South Padre Island). ''We'd probably ride it out again.'' Meanwhile, government agencies are preparing more thoroughly than ever, stockpiling water and food, improving communication technology and outfitting supply trucks with global positioning systems. Hattiesburg, Miss., is buying $4 million worth of generators for its public buildings and water system. Broward County, Fla., bought a $500,000 command post vehicle to shuttle emergency managers among crisis spots. Many areas will offer more hurricane shelters this year, though officials like Herminio Lorenzo, the Miami-Dade County fire chief, are portraying them bleakly to encourage people to make their own plans. ''The very last place you would want to go is a Red Cross shelter,'' Mr. Lorenzo said last week at a community hurricane preparation meeting. ''You're so close to the people sleeping next to you that you can feel the hair of their mustache on the side of your head.'' Some communities are coaxing the public to prepare in a piecemeal way, like saving old milk jugs as emergency water containers and buying one extra can of food on every grocery trip. Escambia County, Fla., is publishing weekly shopping lists to try to get residents to stock up little by little. Martiza Vazquez of Miami said that approach had made preparing more manageable. ''Every time I go to the supermarket I buy four or five cans of tuna or soup or whatever,'' Ms. Vazquez, 37, said. ''I have a checklist that came with the paper the other day, and I am using that to figure out how much is enough.'' Waiting for a taxi to take her to her job at McDonald's, Chanavia Williams of Galveston, who makes $5.75 an hour, laughed at the notion of buying provisions to sock away. ''We got food, but I got none saved,'' said Ms. Williams, 17, the single parent of a 2-year-old, who lives in public housing. Ms. Williams said she would have to sacrifice buying diapers and baby clothes to afford a hurricane survival kit. Still, Ms. Williams, who evacuated on a bus as Hurricane Rita neared, said she wanted to prepare, echoing others who had frightening experiences last year. Wayne P. Sallade, emergency management director in Charlotte County, Fla., which was devastated by Hurricane Charley in 2004, said the Mason-Dixon poll numbers on hurricane preparation were skewed by people in states that had not had hurricanes recently. ''You talk to people in cities here, and there's an absolute fever for information,'' Mr. Sallade said. That is also true in New Orleans and along the Mississippi coast, where post-Hurricane Katrina anxiety has compelled many to prepare diligently this year. But in Houston, Joe Laud, spokesman for the city's emergency center, said only 1,000 people with special needs had registered for public transportation to pick them up in an evacuation. During Hurricane Rita, Mr. Laud said, 25,000 such residents needed help evacuating. Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, at his annual hurricane conference this month in Fort Lauderdale, sourly recalled the chaos after Hurricane Wilma last year, where throngs of residents lined up for free emergency supplies that quickly ran out. ''It makes it a lot harder when people line up in their Lexuses or Mercedeses to get ice and water at a public distribution site when the Publix is open a block away,'' Mr. Bush said. As his audience of emergency workers applauded, he added, ''I don't know about you, but it sure made me feel better to get that off my chest.'' Grant Program Approved NEW ORLEANS, May 30 (AP) -- Louisiana's plan to use federal money for repairs, reconstruction and buyouts of hurricane-damaged property has been approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Housing Secretary Alphonso R. Jackson said Tuesday. The ''Road Home'' plan, pushed by Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, a Democrat, is worth more than $8 billion. Louisiana already has $4.6 billion in hand for the program and is pressing for Congressional approval for an additional $4.2 billion. The plan would provide grants of as much as $150,000 per homeowner."
"Climate researchers at Purdue University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology separately reported new evidence yesterday supporting the idea that global warming is causing stronger hurricanes. That claim is the subject of a long-running scientific dispute. And while the new research supports one side, neither the authors nor other climate experts say it is conclusive. In one new paper, to appear in a coming issue of Geophysical Research Letters, Matthew Huber of the Purdue department of earth and atmospheric sciences and Ryan L. Sriver, a graduate student there, calculate the total damage that could be caused by storms worldwide, using data normally applied to reconciling weather forecast models with observed weather events. The Purdue scientists found that their results matched earlier work by Kerry A. Emanuel, a hurricane expert at M.I.T. Dr. Emanuel has argued that global warming, specifically the warming of the tropical oceans, is already increasing the power expended by hurricanes. The approach used by the Purdue researchers, concentrating on what is called reanalysis data, has never been tried for this purpose before, Dr. Huber said in an interview, adding, ''We were surprised that it did as well as it did.'' In a statement accompanying the release of the study, Dr. Huber said the results were important because the overall measure of cyclone activity, whether through more intense storms or more frequent storms, had doubled with a one-quarter-degree increase in average global temperature. In the other new study, Dr. Emanuel and Michael E. Mann, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, compared records of global sea surface temperatures with those of the tropical Atlantic and said the recent strengthening of hurricanes was attributable largely to the rise in ocean surface temperature. Some researchers say long-term cycles unrelated to global warming are the major cause of hurricane strengthening in recent decades. But Dr. Emanuel and Dr. Mann, whose work is to be published in Eos, a publication of the American Geophysical Union, maintained that the cycles, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, had little if any effect. In fact, they reported that the most recent cooling cycle could just as well be attributed to the presence of particle pollutants in the atmosphere that block sunlight and, they said, could have temporarily counteracted some of the influence of warming from accumulating greenhouse gases. Dr. Mann said the new findings also suggested that as efforts to cut pollution by particles and aerosols continued to intensify, their cooling effects would diminish while the heating effects of greenhouse gases would remain unconstrained. As a result, he said, ''we could be in for much larger increases in Atlantic sea surface temperatures, and tropical cyclone activities, in the decades ahead.'' He joked that some might urge an increase in pollution, but called it ''a Faustian bargain.'' Stanley B. Goldenberg, a meteorologist with the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who has expressed skepticism about any connection between global warming and hurricane intensity, said he had not seen the new papers but had read nothing in other recent research to change his view. ''There's going to be an endless series of articles from this circle that is embracing this new theology built on very flimsy interpretation'' of hurricane data, Mr. Goldenberg said. ''If global warming is having an effect on hurricanes, I certainly wouldn't base it on the articles I've seen.''"
"The Army Corps of Engineers did not shift course to meet the needs of the changing landscape of New Orleans, and as a result the city did not get the hurricane protection system that it needed, a panel of outside engineers said in a report yesterday. The report, prepared by members of the American Society of Civil Engineers at the request of the corps, was stinging in its criticism of the corps' planning and development of New Orleans's hurricane protection system in the decades after Hurricane Betsy in 1965. It said the corps did not follow its own procedures in monitoring the rate at which land was subsiding and water was rising around the city, and it criticized the corps as designing the levee system around outdated data that left floodwalls nearly two feet lower than they should have been. It questioned the corps' decision to base the city's protection on what it called the ''standard project hurricane,'' a strong storm that the corps has said is equivalent to a fast-moving Category 3 storm. The report called the standard ''questionable,'' and said a stronger storm should have been the yardstick. The standard project hurricane, it said, ''is not equivalent to the 100-year storm or even to the largest storm of record.'' The corps never before fully assessed the risks of the New Orleans levee system, the panel noted, and should have done so before the storm. David E. Daniel, chairman of the engineering panel, said panel members found that the hurricane protection system had evolved piecemeal over time, with no single entity in charge of the whole system. He said the corps showed a tendency to ''cut too close to the margins'' when it came to building in safety measures. The result, he said, was ''gross catastrophic failure.'' Responding to the report, Lu Christie, a communications manager for the corps in New Orleans, said: ''We appreciate the work that A.S.C.E. and other organizations have done to support the corps in our effort to repair the New Orleans hurricane protection system. We are reviewing the report now.'' An expert not involved in the new report, Robert G. Bea of the University of California, Berkeley, called the panel's work ''exactly right on.'' The failure to take new information on the local elevation into account and the choice of a ''horribly flawed'' standard for setting the design, Mr. Bea said, were part of ''a whole string'' of breakdowns."
"With the hurricane season less than a month away and memories of Hurricane Katrina still vivid here, Mayor C. Ray Nagin announced a new evacuation plan on Tuesday that relies on buses and trains rather than the cavernous sites of last year's mass misery, the Superdome and the Morial Convention Center. Mr. Nagin said that if a hurricane threatened this year, there would be no ''shelters of last resort'' -- places where the city's poor have gathered to sit out storms, which last year became fetid bunkers for thousands when New Orleans flooded. Instead, the convention center will simply be used as a staging area for residents unable to leave on their own, the mayor said. Buses will pick citizens up and take them there, and other buses will take them out of town. Still, the mayor stopped short of saying that everyone would be forced to leave, emphasizing that though evacuation would be urged if a major storm threatened, ''we're dealing with adults here.'' Amtrak trains will be used to ferry out the elderly and disabled, Mr. Nagin said. Both Mr. Nagin and a top aide emphasized that citizens would primarily be responsible for looking out for themselves when a storm threatens. ''Everybody has the personal responsibility to develop their own evacuation plan,'' said the head of the city's homeland security office, Terry Ebbert, the point man in managing last year's catastrophic storm. Mr. Nagin suggested that the dimensions of the enormous challenge that faced New Orleans last year -- close to 130,000 people without cars -- would be sharply reduced this year with so many residents still dispersed. Perhaps as few as 10,000 will be taking advantage of the city's new evacuation plan, the mayor said, a number that may err on the high side, since the poorest neighborhoods are still empty ruins. Buses were also available in the city after Hurricane Katrina hit, but most remained idle in the absence of a plan by the city to use them. Nonetheless, despite the tiny window of opportunity afforded by the hurricane's rapid approach, some 75 percent of the area's population heeded warnings and evacuated on time. This year, a new challenge is posed by some 7,000 people in unstable trailers, and officials said those residents would be ordered to evacuate for far less threatening storms than Hurricane Katrina and moved to shelters within New Orleans. Mr. Nagin's announcement Tuesday took place in the midst of a heated mayor's race. His opponent, Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu, wasted no time Tuesday criticizing the mayor for waiting until just before June 1, the onset of hurricane season, to release his plan. ''I'm concerned that it took the mayor eight months to announce this plan,'' Mr. Landrieu said. But the mayor, asked whether his new plan would be carried out by his challenger should he lose, quickly shot back, ''If somebody new comes in, they would have to be Einstein to figure this out.''"
"Just in time for hurricane season, some Cancún hotels closed since Hurricane Wilma struck last October are reopening. Others are pushing their starting dates back to the summer. Both the JW Marriott, right, and CasaMagna Marriott will open in June after extensive renovations, adding about 900 rooms to the city with rates starting as low as $149 a night at CasaMagna; 888-236-2427; www.marriott.com. Earlier this month, the 426-room Hilton Cancún Golf and Spa Resort reopened after a $40 million renovation to everything from its rooms to its restaurants. Rates start at $159; 800-445-8667; www.hilton.com. The hotel now plans to spend $2.9 million updating the golf course and changing the turf from Bermuda grass to paspalum, which tolerates salty soil. June opening dates for Starwood's Westin and Sheraton hotels were pushed back to July and December. The Ritz-Carlton will open in the summer instead of on June 15. By the end of July, 22,740 rooms out of the city's 27,822 are expected to be available. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 13 to 16 named storms, including 8 to 10 hurricanes, will form the North Atlantic hurricane season, June 1 through Nov. 30. Four to six could become Category 3 strength or higher. But Cancún hotels say the storms are just part of doing business there. ''Every season here, there are your typical tropical storms,'' said Sergio Serra, director of sales and marketing at the Hilton Cancún, ''Usually, hurricane season doesn't bring the destruction Wilma brought last year. It can't just stop us from running a business in the Caribbean.'' IN TRANSIT"
"Most of the major breaches in the New Orleans levee system during Hurricane Katrina were caused by flaws in design, construction and maintenance -- and parts of the system could still be dangerous even after the current round of repairs by the Army Corps of Engineers, according to a long-awaited independent report to be published Monday. ''People didn't die because the storm was bigger than the system could handle, and people didn't die because the levees were overtopped,'' said Raymond B. Seed, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and the chief author of the report, in a weekend briefing for reporters here. ''People died because mistakes were made,'' he said, ''and because safety was exchanged for efficiency and reduced cost.'' The report differs in significant ways from the findings of the Army Corps' own investigation. That inquiry will produce its report June 1, but interim findings the corps has issued describe a hurricane protection system that failed in some places because of unanticipated design flaws and in other places was simply overwhelmed. A corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Stan Heath, said in an e-mail message that ''it would be inappropriate for the corps to comment'' on the Berkeley-led report since it had not had time to review it thoroughly. The language of the new report, which was created by a group of three dozen engineers and disaster experts led by a team from Berkeley and was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, tends toward arcane geotechnical details. But the message, delivered in some 500 pages, is blistering: The design and construction of the New Orleans hurricane protection system, a project spanning more than 40 years that remains incomplete, was inadequate to protect hundreds of thousands of people in an urban setting. Dozens of factors contributed to the disaster, the authors state, including political decisions that caused the corps to squeeze miles of floodwalls on too-narrow levees along the city's drainage canals, with sheet piles, the interlocking sheets of steel that anchor the levees, driven to a depth too shallow to block water or the shifting of the mucky New Orleans soil. All of the factors, they concluded, add up to a culture of inattention that put safety lower on the scale than cost. The Berkeley study finds fault across the complex web of public and private organizations that should have kept New Orleans safe, from Congress to local levee boards. ''There's plenty of blame to go around,'' said J. David Rogers, a professor of engineering at the University of Missouri, Rolla, who teaches flood control courses for the corps and is one of the report's authors. The group recommended extensive changes for the corps, along with a transformation of the nation's approach to flood protection. The authors applauded the corps' efforts to put in new canal gates, which have taken the riskiest floodwalls in the system out of the front lines, and the use of good construction materials and methods used to rebuild the St. Bernard Parish levees. But, they warned, the parts of the system with sheet piles that were too short before the storm and which are built on weak soil are still very much at risk in a future storm.Under similar circumstances in another storm, Professor Seed said, ''It may still be a very dangerous system.''"
"The Northrop Grumman Corporation, the largest builder of warships in the world, was on a charm offensive here Tuesday. Armed with slides and charts, Philip A. Teel, who runs Northrop's shipyards, led a phalanx of executives who laid out their case for another $200 million from Congress to cover losses from Hurricane Katrina. By Pentagon standards, a request measured in millions of dollars, rather than billions, may seem like small change. But Northrop's effort is emerging as a test case of whether such a large company should receive extra help from taxpayers or bear its financial difficulties on its own. Unusual alliances are squaring off on the issue. Some quarters in Washington, including those typically friendly to military contractors, say that helping Northrop could set a bad precedent. Among those lining up against Northrop are the White House, the Navy and some fiscally conservative Republicans. Northrop, however, has plenty of political muscle on its side. Powerful senators from the gulf region, including Senator Thad Cochran, the Mississippi Republican who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, are fighting on its behalf. At the moment, after prevailing in the Senate, Northrop has the upper hand. But it has failed to persuade a majority in the House, leaving the final settlement to be worked out behind closed doors by lawmakers from both houses of Congress. Northrop executives say the company needs the money to cover cost overruns on Navy shipbuilding contracts that its insurer is refusing to pay. If Congress does not act, Northrop says shipbuilding at its Gulf Coast yards in Pascagoula and Gulfport, Miss., could be slowed by months, if not years. ''This is not a threat,'' said Mr. Teel of Northrop in a morning news conference here. ''I'm telling you what the implications are. Unprecedented events require unprecedented actions.'' The White House issued a policy statement late last month saying that the government should not pick up shipbuilding costs ''that are routinely borne by private insurance.'' To do so, it said, would create an incentive for insurers to deny claims on the assumption that the government would step in. The White House and the Navy also contend that providing the money would make future shipbuilding contracts more difficult to negotiate effectively. If Northrop prevails, their logic goes, companies could more easily pass the responsibility for cost overruns to the government. ''The precedent is not good,'' Delores M. Etter, the Navy's assistant secretary for research, development and acquisition, said in a recent interview in DefenseNews. ''It opens us up for lots of companies to potentially come back and have us cover expenses.'' The current $109 billion Senate supplemental spending measure for Iraq, Afghanistan and Katrina expenses would provide up to $500 million for Northrop to cover the cost of business disruptions. The company's insurer, the Factory Mutual Insurance Company, has denied payment on the ground that Northrop's policy did not include coverage for hurricane flood damage. Northrop, in the meantime, has filed suit against the insurer in federal court. To win political support, Northrop executives also met with the Congressional shipbuilding caucus, which includes over 100 members of Congress. The company estimates that Katrina cost it an additional eight million labor hours on the 12 ships currently under construction. An effort to strike the Northrop payment from the Senate measure failed last week by a 51-to-48 vote in floor debate. Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and a fiscal conservative, led the opposition; he calls the Northrop payment ''corporate welfare.'' Efforts to aid Northrop in the House have failed, leaving the $92 billion supplemental spending bill headed to a conference committee for reconciliation with the larger Senate spending proposal. President Bush has threatened to veto any supplemental measure exceeding $94.5 billion, making the Northrop aid provision particularly vulnerable. John Hart, a spokesman for Senator Coburn, said the ''push-pull of the debate is between the Mississippi delegation and the rest of the party.'' Northrop is also being aided by Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican whose father once worked in the Pascagoula shipyard. Northrop executives have said that if they prevail in court and receive money from their insurer, they will repay the government. But the Defense Contract Management Agency, the Pentagon's auditor of shipbuilding contracts, has countered that if Northrop gets the government money, there is little chance it would ever collect from its insurer. ''If the government pays the costs,'' Donald P. Springer, the agency's auditor for Northrop, wrote in a report, ''there is a risk that insurers will deny coverage on the basis that there has been no loss suffered by Northrop Grumman.''"
"In a breathless finale that has been called one of this generation's greatest adventures in civil engineering, the Army Corps of Engineers has all but completed its repairs to this city's ruined levee system. With just days to go before the beginning of the hurricane season, the corps' $800 million effort has even improved the system in many ways, engineering experts say, with tougher concrete flood walls, brawny new canal gates and more than 150 miles of new or repaired levees. But even though all sides agree that the corps has largely achieved its goal, independent engineers say it is the goal that is the real problem. New Orleans is still very much at risk, they say, because the level of protection the corps has reached is still not as strong as the city needs. Many experts view this hurricane season, which begins on June 1, with trepidation, and hope that the system is not put to a test like Hurricane Katrina before further improvements can be made. ''Some of these things were poorly designed and were almost pre-ordained to fail,'' said Wayne Clough, the head of a National Research Council team that formed at the request of the Department of Defense in order to assess the corps' investigation of the disaster. Parts that did not fail in Hurricane Katrina, he said, could still have been weakened by the stress of last year's storms. ''Just because they've been restored to their condition pre-Katrina doesn't mean they are perfectly safe,'' he said. Raymond Seed, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, who is one of the corps' most consistent critics, said he did not doubt that the system was, to use the mantra of the corps, ''better and stronger'' in many ways. But, he asked, ''Better enough?'' Professor Seed and other experts who have studied the crazy quilt of levees, flood walls, pumps and gates that have been in the process of being built for more than 40 years now say that they were never adequate to protect hundreds of thousands of people in an urban setting and that the levees themselves are now known to be fundamentally flawed. Corps officials say that repairing the damage of the last storm while preparing for new ones is a challenge that their organization is up to. But Maj. Gen. Don T. Riley, the director of civil works for the corps, said he could not guarantee that the system would not fail again. ''You don't know what kind of storm you'll get,'' he said in a recent interview, emphasizing the need for good evacuation planning. Gen. Robert Crear, the head of the Mississippi Valley Division of the corps, said, ''We know Katrina was not the worst possible case.'' What happens from here onward, General Crear said, ''is a continuous program to improve'' the system over time. The corps' race to complete the $800 million in projects that it took on after last year's storms has been a 24/7 marathon rich with tension, apprehension, slipping deadlines and quick-and-dirty workarounds. The sheer scope of the work can only be fully appreciated from the air. Where levees were breached and battered away by Hurricane Katrina's surge and waves, millions of cubic yards of new soil have been put into place along more than half the 350-mile levee system, from the shores of Lake Pontchartrain to the swamps at the southern tip of Louisiana. Sturdy new gates stand at the mouths of the city's three major drainage canals. Storm-damaged pumps are being renewed, along with New Orleanians' capacity to hope. In the city's ruined Lower Ninth Ward, 4,000 feet of new levee stands, the old weak I-shaped flood wall replaced with stronger walls that resemble an inverted T. For long stretches of the renewed system, the ground behind the flood walls is now armored with a white span of concrete intended to keep any water that makes it over the top from scouring away the earth. To the east of the city, at the line of defense facing Lake Borgne, a long fat ribbon of freshly compacted earth, is a levee that will end up being 20 feet high and 11 miles long. Along its seemingly endless stretch of brown soil are yellowish sections, where local soil has been supplemented with tough Mississippi clay. Along Lake Pontchartrain, at the mouths of the drainage canals that cut deep into New Orleans, enormous new floodgates are nearing completion, intended to keep the storm surge from putting the strain on the faulty flood walls that breached in three places and caused much of the flooding in the central city. That ambitious project has slipped behind schedule. Pumps to drain the canal waters when the gates are closed are late at the 17th Street Canal, and the gates are behind schedule at the London Avenue Canal. But Col. Lewis F. Setliff III, the commander of the task force that has been rebuilding the system, said he was confident that the projects would be completed within weeks and that until then, an unseasonably early storm surge could be blocked, if necessary, with sheet pilings driven across the canals. Portable diesel-powered pumps would draw water over to the lake side. It is far from a perfect solution. More powerful, permanent pumping stations are still years away and would have to be approved by Congress. Until then, the level of water in the canals must be kept low, and pumping capacity from the neighborhood pumping stations will have to be reduced -- a prospect that greatly raises the risk of street flooding, but avoids catastrophic breaching. Getting this far required tough talk with the contractors who carry out the corps' plans and 12-hour days at the Federal Reserve Bank Building downtown where Colonel Setliff's task force set up shop. At the beginning of the work on the western end of the levee, in St. Bernard Parish, the contractor, Granite Construction, fell well behind schedule. The corps had what some workers called a ''come-to-Jesus'' meeting with Granite about the schedule, and even shook the company by publishing a request for new bids. By some estimates, Granite increased its pace by an estimated 40-fold, and is completing its part of the levee system on schedule. Some problems remain. The rebuilt eastern wall of the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal, which breached and destroyed the Lower Ninth Ward, is now higher than a long stretch of the old wall on the western side of the canal that did not fail during Hurricane Katrina. In case of a storm with high waters, the western side would overflow first, sending floodwaters into the city. The corps has asked Congress to approve financing for new gates that could be closed to block surges in that large canal, also known as the Industrial Canal. But that additional level of protection is years away. Although the corps will continue to raise and toughen the flood walls after the June 1 deadline, it has begun to study the larger question of how to improve the overall protection level. An interim report will come out next month, but the study will not be completed until December 2007. And any new initiatives would have to be approved by Congress. It was in 1965, after Hurricane Betsy flooded New Orleans, that Congress first approved the city's hurricane protection system, authorizing a system based on what the corps would call ''the most severe storm that is considered reasonably characteristic of a region.'' The corps built the system to protect against a hurricane with wind speeds of what is now considered a Category 2 storm, or up to 110 miles an hour. In many ways, though, that standard fell far short of the region's most severe storms like Hurricane Camille in 1969 or the storm that devastated Galveston, Tex., in 1900. Over the years, experts and federal agencies have urged the corps to build to higher standards, but corps officials did not change course. Corps officials say that they build what Congress authorizes them to build and that shifting large projects is difficult once they are under way. ''The impression that we get is that the corps, once it's locked on a track, will not take input from outside groups,'' said Ivor van Heerden, a founder of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center. Now, Mr. van Heerden said, ''It seems like Louisiana is now having to pay for not getting it right the first time.'' He said the system at this point could only fully protect against a Category 2 storm. The degree of vulnerability was underscored on Monday, when an independent team of researchers led by engineering professors at the University of California, Berkeley, and supported by the National Science Foundation released a report that found the hurricane protection system riddled with errors in design, construction and maintenance -- a pattern of inattention to safety that caused the system to crumble in a hurricane that should have, for the most part, caused little more than wind damage and a day or so of street flooding. ''The overall New Orleans flood protection system,'' Professor Seed said in a briefing last weekend, ''must be considered suspect.''"
"ACCORDING to Larry Davis, who has sold real estate in the Florida Panhandle for 15 years, ''nothing can compete with Seaside,'' the original New Urbanist community where pastel-colored houses carry million-dollar price tags. But his new development, Owl's Head, near Freeport, Fla., has something Seaside can't offer: elevation. ''It's a pretty slow rise as you drive up from the beach,'' Mr. Davis said. ''But by the time you get to Owl's Head'' -- due north of Seaside and about 15 miles inland -- ''you're at about 100 feet.'' By Florida standards, he said, ''this is nosebleed country.'' And that, to some buyers, could be a blessing. After two seasons in which hurricanes battered the Gulf Coast, destroying houses and much of the beach itself, some customers may like the idea of living inland, where they are protected from storm surges. It's too early to say if repeated hurricane threats will change the dynamics of Florida real estate, in which beachfront property has always been the holy grail. But some developers, including Mr. Davis's employers, clearly believe that higher ground can be a selling point. (In fact, after Owl's Head introduced the slogan ''Florida's Coastal Inland Heights,'' the Walton County Chamber of Commerce decided to use it, too. On May 24, the chamber will be the host for a kickoff event complete with an ''oxygen bar'' for people who aren't accustomed to the altitude, said Dawn Moliterno, the chamber's president.) For his part, Mr. Davis -- whose half brother, Robert, conceived and developed Seaside -- carries an altimeter when he walks the Owl's Head property with customers. The altimeter, which resembles a watch and cost $150, ''reinforces the idea that we're not at sea level anymore,'' Mr. Davis said, adding that his marketing team suggested he buy the device. It must be working. Mr. Davis said that 60 lots have already been sold at Owl's Head for $80,000 to $285,000. That's a pittance compared with prices on the coast. At Seaside and Rosemary Beach, another New Urbanist community on the Gulf of Mexico, where owners include Karl Rove, water-view lots are listed for around $2 million. Yet brokers in the area say the market along the coast has slowed nearly to a halt since Hurricane Dennis last summer. ''Nothing's selling,'' said Stephen Robbins, an agent for Seagrove on the Beach Realty in Seagrove Beach. ''Wealthy buyers will continue to want the ultimate, which means living on the water,'' he said. But otherwise, he said, ''I can understand people who want a buffer.'' For one thing, people who live on the coast have to evacuate whenever a big storm seems to be headed their way. ''I've had to leave my house 10 times in the last 10 years,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''Sometimes, I've had tears in my eyes.'' David S. Nolan, a professor of meteorology at the University of Miami, said, ''Certainly, at 110 feet they're protected from storm surges.'' But he added that houses at Owl's Head could still suffer hurricane damage, particularly because much of what separates them from the Gulf of Mexico is a bay. In the face of a powerful storm, Dr. Nolan said, Owl's Head residents ''might still want to leave.'' In 2004, Forrest A. Westin, then a graduate student at M.I.T., studied real estate in four Florida counties and determined that from 1977 to 2002, waterfront property, already much more expensive than inland property, also gave investors a greater return. Reached in Berkeley, Calif., where he is now a developer, Mr. Westin said he didn't know if that relationship was changing, but he noted that ''there were obviously a number of hurricanes in that period of 25 years, and if you held onto your house long enough, you came out ahead of someone who was inland.'' Dean H. Gatzlaff, a professor of business administration at Florida State University in Tallahassee, believes that at least until 2004, hurricane activity was factored into prices of waterfront property. However, he wrote in an e-mail message, the higher level of hurricane activity in 2004 and 2005, to the degree it surprised buyers, ''would not have been priced.'' ''If the level of hurricane activity is again surprisingly high in 2006,'' he wrote, ''we'll continue to see a dampening of prices.'' Mr. Davis, the Owl's Head broker, lives about 150 yards from the gulf, in Inlet Beach. He moved to Walton County 18 years ago and took a job working for his half-brother, Robert, in Seaside's rental program. Later, he created Davis Properties, which sells real estate throughout the Panhandle. Last year, he was brought in by three Atlanta businessmen who had purchased the land for Owl's Head. Jeff Tucker, who described himself as the ''primary development partner,'' said they paid about $22,000 an acre. The developers are selling ''peace of mind,'' Mr. Tucker said, but there are other advantages to being inland. Along the coast, the need for structural reinforcements and hurricane-proof windows can add thousands of dollars to the cost of a new house. Then, too, the price of insurance along the coast is high and getting higher, Mr. Tucker said. Several brokers in the area said that insuring a house along the gulf can cost at least twice as much as insuring a similar house inland, though they declined to give specific figures because, they said, every situation is different. Two years ago, Mr. Tucker and his partners hired Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company, the Miami architecture firm that designed Seaside and Rosemary Beach, to lay out Owl's Head, one of the few New Urbanist towns to incorporate a golf course. Such pairings are rare because the usual goal of developers -- to use the course as a bucolic setting for as many lots as possible -- is inconsistent with the New Urbanist goal of grouping houses together in a tight block. But the Owl's Head course, which carries the Arnold Palmer brand name, occupies a discrete part of town and is approachable from public streets. Marina Khoury, an architect with Duany Plater-Zyberk, said, ''We went to great lengths not to privatize the golf course, so that it becomes an amenity that's available to everybody.'' Thad Layton, the landscape architect with the Palmer Course Design Company in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., who is designing the Owl's Head course, said the hilly topography makes it more interesting than many other courses in the state. ''Some of the holes in the back nine are going to have quite a lot of elevation change,'' he said. But ''quite a lot of elevation change'' is relative. The highest point in Florida -- Britton Hill in Lakewood (also in Walton County) -- is a mere 345 feet. Of the highest points in the 50 states, it is the lowest. NATIONAL PERSPECTIVES"
"The Great Deluge Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast By Douglas Brinkley Illustrated. 716 pages. William Morrow. $29.95. The Storm What Went Wrong and Why During Hurricane Katrina By Ivor van Heerden and Mike Bryan Illustrated. 308 pages. Viking. $25.95. The horror and wretchedness produced by Hurricane Katrina and the government's laggard efforts at relief challenged witnesses' descriptive powers. They drew analogies to disaster movies and horror movies, to Dante's Inferno and Milton's hell, to a futuristic Mad Max world and a vanished medieval fief. Hieronymus Bosch's infernal depictions of misery were invoked, and so were scenes from Job and the Book of Revelations. The Perfect Storm had turned the Big Easy into a place of biblical suffering and woe. The historian Douglas Brinkley's harrowing new book, ''The Great Deluge,'' captures the human toll of Katrina as graphically as the most vivid newspaper and television accounts did, and by pulling together a huge, choral portrait of what happened during that first week of havoc and distress (from Saturday, Aug. 27, through Saturday, Sept. 3), he gives the reader a richly detailed timeline of disaster -- a timeline in which the sheer cumulative power of details impresses upon us, again, just how abysmally inept relief efforts were on every level, from FEMA to the Red Cross to the New Orleans Police Department, from the federal government to state and local authorities. By moving back and forth between panoramic views and up-close zoom shots of individuals, Mr. Brinkley is able to convey both the larger arc of the tragedy that engulfed the Gulf Coast and the intimate fallout that that catastrophe had on the lives of ordinary people -- many of them black and most of them poor and lacking the resources to evacuate on their own. Published less than a year after Katrina's rampage, ''The Great Deluge'' remains heavily indebted to newspaper, magazine and television reporting, most especially to articles that appeared in The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. And in writing a ''fast out of the gates'' book, Mr. Brinkley focuses his energies on providing a you-are-there sort of narrative. He does not try to address questions about the future of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the costs of rebuilding, environmental issues or the need to implement better methods of flood control, much less the broader sort of questions about long-term political, social and economic fallout that ''Rising Tide,'' John M. Barry's extraordinary account of the great Mississippi flood of 1927, examined so brilliantly from a vantage point many decades removed. But while this volume lacks the scope and magisterial perspective of ''Rising Tide,'' it does leave the reader with a similarly sobering apprehension of the human failings that magnified nature's cruelty: the hubris, stupidity and wishful thinking that led government officials to ignore the myriad warnings about the vulnerable levee system of New Orleans, and the venality, indifference, political gamesmanship and simple incompetence that contributed to the deadly delays in getting help to Katrina's victims. A professor of history at Tulane University, Mr. Brinkley writes not as a detached observer but as a longtime resident of New Orleans, and his passion for his beleaguered city -- and his anger at the government's mismanagement of the situation -- are palpable in these pages. He describes ''Katrinaworld'' as ''a denuded black hole of double-talking gibberish where the bureaucrats hid behind the white marble walls of statistical procedure and partisan politics,'' and he charges that ''every time the Bush administration and the State of Louisiana hesitated, lawyered up and read the fine print on homeland security procedure, an American died prematurely.'' Although many of the scenes Mr. Brinkley describes will be familiar to readers from news accounts, he captures the surreal horror that reigned in New Orleans, as the levees were breached, and water poured in, turning the city into a ''smattering of islands, rising out of the 80 percent of the city's land that was submerged.'' He shows us people drowning in their own homes, as they watched their pets, their photos, their possessions of a lifetime wash away; doctors and nurses scrambling to save critically ill patients, as flood-stricken animals (crabs, snakes, turtles, an armadillo) scuttled through hospital corridors; and looters wading through the streets ''like sinister Santa Clauses with bags of stolen merchandise over their shoulders.'' He takes us to the fetid Superdome, where the promised evacuation buses failed to show up day after day, where ''mass confusion reigned,'' and ''a number of women were raped, and a couple of men were stabbed.'' He revisits the even more chaotic Convention Center, where corpses reeked in the hot, suffocating air, and roving gangs ''marked out territory and defended it with guns purloined from stores.'' And he points out the spot on the I-10 highway, where ''people huddled together,'' under the shade of some highway signs, ''making a home of the barren roadway, holding their belongings in a pillowcase or a cart'' and looking like ''refugees from some war-torn area overseas.'' ''Americans were not used to seeing their country in ruins, their people in want,'' Mr. Brinkley writes. ''They began to feel ashamed that their country was either unable or unmotivated to provide the basic necessities of food, water and shelter within its own borders.'' The portraits Mr. Brinkley draws of key government players in the relief (or rather, lack of relief) efforts are scathing. Gov. Kathleen Blanco, though the most sympathetically portrayed government official in this volume, emerges as a dithering executive who should have ''better prepared Louisiana for the Big One'' and who spent the crucial, early hours of the storm ''going through the motions but not much more.'' FEMA's director, Michael Brown, comes across as a self-absorbed paper pusher, hopelessly ''out of his depth'' and cautiously trying to apply a plan to a disaster that had blown all plans to shreds, and New Orleans's mayor, Ray Nagin, as a foolish coward, slow to order a mandatory evacuation because he was worried about closing hotels (which might then sue the city for disrupting the tourist trade) and reluctant to try to rally residents' spirits at the Superdome because he put ''his own personal safety ahead of those poor and elderly in trouble.'' Mr. Brinkley's greatest contempt, however, seems reserved for George W. Bush, who comes across as an uncaring, out-of-touch president, bizarrely slow to grasp the magnitude of the disaster and reluctant to exercise leadership when it most mattered; and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who is depicted as being callous to ''the apocalyptic needs of the entire Gulf Coast region,'' apparently unconcerned (as he attended a flu seminar on Tuesday, Aug. 30, in Atlanta) ''with the massive flooding in New Orleans -- even though he had been told by Mr. Brown the night before about the 17th Street Canal breach and even though reports on television on Tuesday morning were showing live footage of a city and a region falling into the very pits of inhumanity.'' Given the relief vacuum left by FEMA, the Coast Guard stepped up, as did smaller agencies like the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and myriad individuals, intent on aiding neighbors and strangers alike. Five young Mississippi men, a couple of them great-great-grandchildren of Confederate soldiers, risked their lives to save a black family in a small Gulf Coast town; the so-called NOLA Homeboys, New Orleans residents with yachts and dinghies and canoes, refused to evacuate so they could save fellow citizens; and one AIDS doctor at Charity Hospital determined to ride out the storm with her 18 patients, vowing that the group would stick together as a unit. It is Mr. Brinkley's portraits of such valiant individuals, combined with dozens of interviews with Katrina survivors, that lend his narrative an emotional immediacy and give the alarming statistics -- more than 1,500 deaths at present count, and according to Mr. Brinkley, some 400,000 displaced residents in Louisiana alone, months after the storm -- a local habitation and a name. The narrative approach of Ivor van Heerden, co-founder and deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, is less personal and more science-based than Mr. Brinkley's, but his book (written with Mike Bryan) is equally disturbing in its own way. And he comes to similar conclusions about the human failures that turned Katrina from a dangerous hurricane into a calamitous disaster. The catastrophe (or the magnitude of it, anyway) was ''preventable,'' he stresses: ''If science and engineering had been allowed to play their proper role in the development of policies for the wetlands and the levees, we wouldn't be in this situation today.'' Mr. van Heerden reminds us of the frightening National Weather Service warning, issued on Sunday morning, Aug. 28, that declared that ''most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks perhaps longer,'' ''at least one half of well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure,'' ''power outages will last for weeks,'' and ''water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.'' He also reminds us that experts like himself had been warning for years of the catastrophe awaiting New Orleans, noting that some ''local geographers and oceanographers and engineers'' had started ''to suspect that Louisiana was not only more vulnerable to devastation than its citizens wanted to admit, but far more vulnerable than it had been, because the wetlands that buffer the inland zones, including New Orleans, were disappearing at an alarming rate.'' Equally unnerving are Mr. van Heerden's observations that Katrina ''was not the big one,'' and that ''sometime in the foreseeable future a bigger storm will not take that last-minute jog to the east, and every square foot of New Orleans -- and all of it, not just 80 percent -- will be underwater, and deeper underwater than this time.'' If short-term political and commercial interests continue to trump science, if changes in flood control are not made, and adequate financing is not provided, he warns, ''one-fifth of the state of Louisiana -- everything south of Interstate 10 including the city of New Orleans in its entirety -- will disappear beneath the waves, gone for good, and we will have no one to blame but ourselves.'' Should that happen, future authors like Mr. van Heerden and Mr. Brinkley will not be writing about New Orleans or southern Louisiana. They will be writing about what Mr. van Heerden calls the ''Cajun Atlantis.'' BOOKS OF THE TIMES"
"Though it was fictitious, ''Hurricane Alicia'' offered state and federal officials gathered here on Tuesday an opportunity to test new plans for evacuating and sheltering thousands of people fleeing a major Gulf storm. Officials hope the blueprint, which was put into practice in a statewide drill, will eliminate at least some of the bedlam that the region endured during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year, which killed more than 1,200 Louisiana residents. Tony Robinson, regional director of response and recovery for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that several signs suggested the new initiatives would be an improvement. Armbands and bar codes were used to track ''evacuees'' in New Orleans during the day's exercises, Mr. Robinson said. Plans to use rail lines, commercial air travel and military buses to move people out of harm's way -- efforts not employed last year -- are in the works. For the purposes of the drill, officials tracked a fake Category 3 storm as it was poised to make landfall in southeastern Louisiana. Had a catastrophic hurricane really been 48 hours out, the state plan called for the activation of more than 6,000 National Guard troops, a voluntary evacuation of low-lying areas and the reversal of traffic flow on the major Interstate highways out of New Orleans to accommodate a multilane exodus. As Hurricane Katrina approached land last year, more than one million people fled the New Orleans region, taking refuge in Baton Rouge and other metropolitan areas along Interstate 10. Those without transportation were left to deal with the floodwaters that breached broken levees and with the shortage of food and water in ''shelters of last resort'' like the Superdome and the city's convention center. Those buildings would not be an option for those hoping, or forced, to ride out future storms, officials said. Future evacuations, however, will be drastically different, since only half the city's population has returned. Col. Jeff Smith, acting director of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the state now anticipated more than 200,000 people fleeing southeastern Louisiana in case of a hurricane. Shelters in the state are being prepared to take in 65,000 people, Social Services Secretary Ann Silverberg Williamson said. That is 20 percent more than could be accommodated last year. Officials added that a permanent shelter in northern Louisiana was being designed specifically for evacuees, with special-needs shelters already in place to provide medical care and help evacuees in housing pets. Colonel Smith said the state had been securing as many buses as possible, taking loaners from schools, the federal government and commercial companies. The exercise indicated that three million bottles of water, one million ready-to-eat meals, 20,000 cots and 34,000 blankets would be in place for distribution no more than 48 hours before a major storm. More than 90 boats had been secured for search-and-rescue, Colonel Smith said, adding that each would be equipped with six days' worth of food, water and fuel. In Washington on Tuesday, federal officials outlined hurricane plans as well. Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, said the department had stockpiled four times as many meals as it had last year and more than twice the amount of water, which he said could sustain one million people for seven days. Mr. Chertoff also said FEMA would be able to track its relief trucks; that would help to avoid the confusion from last year, when the agency could not say when its trucks would arrive or even where they were."
"New Orleans had a false sense of security. A new report by an independent review panel found that flaws in the manmade levee system were largely responsible for the breaches that caused deadly flooding in and around New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. As John Schwartz reported in yesterday's Times, three dozen engineers and disaster experts studied the region's hurricane protection system and found that the storm system had not been up to the task of protecting the city. Raymond Seed, an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley and the lead author of the report, put it about as succinctly as anyone has in the nine months since Katrina made landfall. ''People didn't die because the storm was bigger than the system could handle,'' Mr. Seed told reporters, ''and people didn't die because the levees were overtopped. People died because mistakes were made and because safety was exchanged for efficiency and reduced cost.'' In Katrina's immediate aftermath, the suffering of the victims trapped in New Orleans received national attention and generated significant -- and well-justified -- outrage. The mishandled evacuation of residents and the government's failure to mount effective rescue and relief operations received the most opprobrium. More quietly, a debate began over whether it was worth rebuilding a city that lay in the path of such unstoppable storms. The rationale against the city's rebirth hinged upon the notion that such damage could not have been prevented and would not be preventable in the future. We are trained by disaster films to see results like those as unavoidable, somehow preordained. What this report says clearly is that much of the death and destruction in New Orleans was a result of human failings, not nature's fury. It also means that the government has a responsibility to help those whose homes stood behind the ill-designed and poorly built walls. We are barely a week away from the start of the next hurricane season, and another above-average storm season is predicted. While efforts to shore up the battered levee system continue, large parts of it are still vulnerable. We owe it to New Orleans to get it right because there will be a next time. Editorial"
"Government forecasters predicted Monday that 13 to 16 tropical storms would form in the Atlantic Ocean during the six-month hurricane season that begins June 1, far fewer than last year's calamitous season but still more than usual. Of those storms, 8 to 10 are likely to become hurricanes, including as many as 6 major hurricanes, those of Category 3 strength or higher, said Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Two to four hurricanes are likely to make landfall in the United States this season, he said. The heightened potential for storms comes from tropical waters that, while cooler than last summer's, are still warmer than usual, along with favorable wind patterns, Mr. Lautenbacher said. Much, however, will depend on smaller-scale weather patterns that cannot be predicted this far in advance, he said. ''Remember that it only takes one hurricane in your neighborhood to make it a bad season,'' Mr. Lautenbacher said in a news conference at the National Hurricane Center. He and other forecasters and emergency officials urged the public to prepare more scrupulously than last season, saying citizens should do a better job of stockpiling supplies in advance, preparing evacuation plans and heeding evacuation orders from officials. Federal hurricane experts say the Atlantic Ocean is in a cycle of intense hurricane activity that started in 1995, producing 28 named storms last year, more than at any other time since the government began keeping records in the mid-1800's. Other experts, including some scientists working for the oceanic agency, say that a decades-long global warming trend, linked by most climate experts to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping emissions, may be playing a role in increasing the power of hurricanes in recent decades. While there is significant debate and little clear data on what forces, natural or human, have played a role in recent seasons, many ocean and climate experts say it is likely that warmer oceans will favor stronger storms in coming decades. Fifteen of last year's storms grew into hurricanes, the fiercest of which, Hurricane Katrina, devastated New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, killing at least 1,100 people. Three others made landfall: Hurricane Dennis, which hit the Florida Panhandle on July 10; Hurricane Rita, which made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border on Sept. 24; and Hurricane Wilma, which pummeled South Florida on Oct. 24. On average, the Atlantic hurricane season produces 11 named storms, with 6 becoming hurricanes, according to NOAA. In what Mr. Lautenbacher called a ''silver lining,'' a weak La Niña condition -- a cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean that often encourages stronger hurricanes in the Atlantic -- has dissipated and will not be a factor this year. But existing wind patterns could combine to reduce wind shear over the Atlantic, thereby encouraging hurricane formation. Wind shear occurs when winds at successively higher altitudes differ in velocity or direction. This condition can shred tropical storms before they grow to hurricane proportions. A storm is considered a hurricane when its winds reach 74 miles per hour. A central paradox in hurricane forecasting is that while experts have become adept at presaging a busy storm season, they still have not improved predictions for whether hurricanes will strike land, or where they are most apt to strike. Luck still largely determines whether a particular spot on a map, say the Outer Banks of North Carolina or the Florida Keys, will suffer in a particular season, said Kerry A. Emanuel, a hurricane expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That uncomfortable reality is why forecasters tend to fall back on the standard wisdom that anyone in a hurricane-prone region needs to prepare for the worst. The seasonal forecasts swing on several sets of conditions in the atmosphere and the tropical Atlantic Ocean: water temperature, the potential for wind shear, and patterns in atmospheric pressure between Africa, where most tropical storms are born, and the Americas, where they tend to go. Several researchers, including Dr. Emanuel, have published papers in the past year in which they claim to have found a big buildup in the power of hurricanes in recent decades that can be explained only by human-driven global warming. But a separate camp of scientists, including Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center, and some other federal hurricane researchers, contends that natural cycles in temperatures in the Atlantic and atmospheric patterns above the sea surface caused a lull in midcentury and have contributed to the surge in storminess since 1995. While scientists remain divided on the cause of this intense period, emergency officials were united Monday in stressing that people in hurricane zones were responsible for their own safety and should move more quickly when told to flee. ''We have to somehow get that message across,'' said R. David Paulison, acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''When you don't take care of yourselves, it stops our first responders in the street from dealing with people who really do need help.''"
"After Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Ivor van Heerden and his colleagues searched through homes in the city he calls the Cajun Atlantis, looking for battery-powered clocks. In the face of horrifying destruction, Dr. van Heerden, the deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, knew that small things helped tell the big story. The moment that the clocks' time stopped could show when the homes filled with water, data ''vitally important to any good forensic study,'' as he puts it in his new book, ''The Storm: What Went Wrong During Hurricane Katrina -- The Inside Story From One Louisiana Scientist,'' published last week by Viking. Of the two most prominent new books on the subject, his is likelier to get fewer readers. Many will probably snap up Douglas Brinkley's book ''The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.'' Dr. Brinkley, a historian at Tulane University, has written best-selling books, and his account digs the dirt on politicians and their failures, with a focus on details like how long Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans took to shave his head aboard Air Force One. Dr. van Heerden's book, written with Mike Bryan, a professional author, is concerned with a different kind of dirt: the stuff that goes into and under levees. It is suffused by his passion for the city and his anger over what he says was a preventable disaster. As a former chief of the state's office of coastal restoration efforts and a leader of the hurricane center, he had long been one of the state's best-known Cassandras on the coming crisis for New Orleans. In the months since the storm, as leader of the state's team of investigators of the disaster, he has helped reveal the flaws in design, construction and maintenance of the city's hurricane protection system that contributed to the destruction. Seeing the storm-ravaged homes and smelling the stench of death in them, he writes, ''convinced me to try to get the federal government to own up to the fact that this city was flooded by the failure of its levees.'' To many in Louisiana this outspokenness has made Dr. van Heerden a hero. But at his university it has gotten him called on the carpet for threatening the institution's relationship with the federal government and the research money that comes with that. Last November two vice chancellors at Lousiana State -- Michael Ruffner, in charge of communications for the university, and Harold Silverman, who leads the office of research -- brought him in for a meeting. As Dr. van Heerden recalled in an interview in Baton Rouge, La., the two administrators -- one of whom controlled his position, which is nontenured -- said that ''they would prefer that I not talk to the press because it could hurt L.S.U.'s chances of getting federal funding in the future.'' The administrators told him to work through the university's media relations department instead. Dr. van Heerden regarded the meeting as a threat to his career. ''I actually spoke to my wife about it that night,'' he remembered, ''and said: 'Look, we need to recognize that I could lose my job. Are we prepared for that? Because I'm not going to stop.' '' The vice chancellors' directive lasted less than a week: after Dr. van Heerden channeled dozens of interview requests through the media office, the administrators dropped the new requirement. E-mail messages about the incident obtained through a formal request to Louisana State University include an angry note to administrators from one of Dr. van Heerden's colleagues, Roy Dokka. Dr. Dokka, a geologist who is an expert on subsidence, the lowering of the ground's surface because of changes below, like the pumping of water or oil from underground reservoirs, is executive director of the Louisiana State University Center for Geoinformatics. His message said that during visits to Washington ''I am asked how so-and-so's irresponsible behavior is tolerated.'' His message concluded: ''Academic freedom can be a shield to be stupid, but it is not a license to be irresponsible on public policy issues that involve lives and public safety. The university will remain in third-rate category unless the 'cowboys' are reighned in.'' (The word is misspelled, possibly a result of angry haste or carelessness.) A message from Mr. Ruffner, the vice chancellor for communications, to Dr. van Heerden after their meeting stated that the university wanted to be in on helping with the recovery of Louisiana, ''not in pointing blame.'' In an interview Mr. Ruffner said Dr. van Heerden's training in environmental management did not qualify him to comment on engineering matters. ''We don't see him as a viable source to be discussing the engineering aspect of the levees,'' he said. ''I have an advanced degree in communications, but that doesn't qualify me to comment on the New York Philharmonic.'' But, he added, as long as Dr. van Heerden does not claim to represent the views of the university, ''he can say anything he wants.'' Dr. Dokka said in an interview that he had written his heated warning to the university about ''cowboys'' after a visit to the Army Corps of Engineers headquarters in Washington not long after the storm. An official noticed Dr. Dokka's Louisiana State lapel pin. ''He looks at it and says, 'What the hell is wrong with L.S.U.?' '' Dr. Dokka recalled. Dr. van Heerden pointed out that he had never claimed to be an engineer but said that he had worked closely with those with greater expertise in that discipline. He noted that the broad conclusion his team had come to -- that the levees failed largely because of human error -- were shared by every other major investigation of the issues, including the corps' own. ''There's nothing we have put out there that hasn't been proved true by other teams,'' he said. And, he added, he suspects that his critics may not be as upset about what he might have gotten wrong as about what he has gotten right. Dr. van Heerden, 55, came from the Natal province of South Africa to Louisiana in 1977 to do coastal research. He began banging the drum about the hurricane threat in 1994. In 2000 he helped found the hurricane center, which the university says is the largest resource of hurricane experts in the world and which has become a respected multidisciplinary institution that studies storms, defenses against them and their effects on society. After Katrina hit, Dr. van Heerden said, he and his colleagues at the hurricane center realized that ''those people sitting on the roofs and standing in the water don't have a voice.'' But, he said, the issue is far from over. ''Nature's given us a second chance,'' he observed. ''Katrina was the warning. Katrina showed us a lot of our weaknesses.'' Now is the time, he added, for dirt, concrete and steel. ''We've got to hope and pray that before we get anything like another Katrina, that we've raised the levees, armored them and built the necessary floodgates,'' he said. If the system is not just patched but thoroughly improved, he said, ''A lot of people will be a lot more willing to come back.'' ''But right now,'' he concluded, ''there's nothing for them to come back to.''"
"If ever there was a moment for the obscure federal flood insurance program to ride to the rescue, it would seem to have been in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Its premiums were supposed to insure homeowners in flood-prone areas and also protect taxpayers from spending billions to bail out flood victims. But with Hurricane Katrina, the program failed on both counts. Nearly half the victims did not even have flood insurance. Claims from homeowners who were insured, $25 billion worth, bankrupted the program. And the government has had to commit $15 billion in additional taxpayer money for rebuilding in Louisiana and Mississippi. Now, an effort to rescue the insurance program that grew in Hurricane Katrina's wake is faltering, too. Though experts foresee a generation of fiercer and more frequent storms, Congress seems unlikely to make more than modest changes when it takes up the program in the coming weeks. The drive to restructure the perennially underfinanced program has been blocked by real estate interests, who worry that requiring millions more people to buy flood insurance would stifle development, and by lawmakers from areas that rarely flood who see their constituents as supporting those who are frequently flooded, particularly in the South. ''You've got people living in dry areas paying for people who want to keep living in wet ones,'' said Representative Candice S. Miller, Republican of Michigan. ''They're sticking it to us, and I don't like to be stuck.'' The inability over decades to work out who pays the bill for flooding is at the heart of the weaknesses in the insurance program so blatantly laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. A close examination of the program shows how those same lobbying pressures and regional rivalries have helped create an insurance plan that has consistently defied the central rule of how to succeed in the insurance trade: have enough policyholders paying enough in premiums to spread out the risk and build a financial cushion against disaster. Since its beginning in the late 1960's, the flood program has struggled against a basic handicap: Most people, except those in the clearest path of danger, believe they do not need it. So, in an effort to make the insurance affordable and attractive to reluctant homeowners, the government has kept premiums artificially low -- typically $300 to $400 a year for coverage up to $250,000. At the same time, though, it has limited the size of the program's flood zones -- the only areas in which many people are required to buy the policies. A result, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, is an insurance plan in serious danger, groping for a politically palatable way to grow. Testifying before Congress this year, the flood program's acting director, David I. Maurstad, acknowledged that it faced ''numerous challenges on a variety of fronts.'' But insurance officials also say the program, which takes in only $2.2 billion in fees each year, was never meant to handle a devastating storm like Hurricane Katrina. Even so, many of the program's critics in Congress and elsewhere argue that it can and should be rebuilt as a stronger hedge against a less-catastrophic run of storms. ''It hasn't come close to its promise of insuring everyone who's in danger of being flooded, reducing the cost of disasters for the federal government or making sure the program ultimately pays its own way,'' said J. Robert Hunter, who once ran the program and is director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. ''It's like a trip through the looking glass,'' he added. ''Everything is backwards.'' Asking Beneficiaries to Pay The idea of federal flood insurance began in the early 1950's with President Harry S. Truman, after big floods in his home state, Missouri. Private insurers would not provide the coverage, arguing that only those most likely to be flooded would buy it, and that an avalanche of claims would bring big financial losses. But what finally brought the idea to fruition nearly two decades later was a desire to do something about the rising cost of federal disaster relief. In particular, Congress felt it was important that the beneficiaries helped pay the bill. Under the program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps areas along coasts, lakes and rivers with significant flood risk -- a 1 percent chance of flooding in any year -- and tries to sell insurance to people in or near them. Though more than 4.8 million people have the policies, that includes only about half the households in the flood zones. To attract buyers, the government discounted the premiums, some to a fraction of what a private company would have charged. But initially, no one was required to buy flood insurance, and hardly anyone did. ''People would just say, 'It won't happen to me,' '' George K. Bernstein, the program's first administrator, said in an interview. Gilbert F. White, a retired professor whose research in the mid-1960's laid the foundation for the program, said the government originally considered larger flood zones but pulled back under pressure from homebuilders and real estate developers. The program also linked the availability of insurance to agreements by local governments to enact new building codes intended to reduce flood damage, mainly by raising houses above expected flood levels. But the real estate interests persuaded many communities to stay out of the program, Mr. Bernstein said. A Program Overwhelmed In the summer of 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused $400 million in flood damage along the Eastern Seaboard; only $5 million was covered by insurance. Soon after, Congress made the insurance mandatory for people in the flood zones with federally regulated mortgages. These measures let the program expand just enough to limp along. Over the years, it paid out almost $15 billion in claims, borrowing from the Treasury in bad years and paying the money back, with interest, in quieter times. But by early last year, the fund had slipped into the red again, drained by $2 billion in claims from the hurricanes in Florida in 2004. Then came Hurricane Katrina. Along the Mississippi coast, waves up to 30 feet high surged past the flood-zone boundaries. Federal figures show that two-thirds of the 46,000 flooded homes and apartments in Mississippi were outside the zones. One problem was the flood maps, which had not been updated in more than a decade and no longer reflected the true danger. In New Orleans, the program stumbled on another assumption: though experts had long warned that a terrible hurricane could top the levees and inundate the low-lying city, that possibility was never factored into the hazard calculations. Instead, the mapmakers focused solely on the impact of heavy rains. Luckily for New Orleans, which often floods in bad rains, the bulk of the city was in the flood zones. So 65 percent of the 54,000 flooded homeowners had at least some insurance. But a few areas that flooded badly from the levee breaks, like much of the Lower Ninth Ward, were outside the zones. Relatively few people there, or among the city's large population of renters, had insurance. And many others had only enough to cover their mortgages, leaving little cash to rebuild. Joy Fortune, a retired bank executive, and her 86-year-old mother, Hazel Castanel, had a $73,000 flood policy on their beige brick home. But after the house sat in six feet of water for two weeks, an adjuster estimated the damage at $124,000, leaving them $51,000 short. At first, it looked as if they would not be able to rebuild. But then the Bush administration and Congress came up with $15 billion in grants to make up for gaps in insurance. ''We want to go back,'' Ms. Fortune said. ''It's my home and it's our life.'' Even with the gaps, the program was swamped by $25 billion in claims from Hurricane Katrina and two other hurricanes last fall, and it will need to borrow all that money from the government to pay them. What is more, insurance officials say they doubt they will be able to pay much of it back, leaving taxpayers with the bill just as if there were no insurance program. It was with that huge bill in mind that two influential congressmen -- Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican who heads the Financial Services Committee, and Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat -- drafted legislation that would have greatly expanded the flood zones to draw millions more homeowners into the program. The new zones would have encompassed areas considered only one-fifth as susceptible to flooding in any given year. 'A Unique Opportunity' Flood experts, consumer advocates, environmentalists and some insurance experts welcomed the move. But lobbyists for homebuilders, real estate agents and mortgage lenders cautioned lawmakers that the extra cost of flood insurance could hurt housing sales and slow the economy. The program ''may need a tune-up, but I don't think it needs radical change,'' David L. Pressly Jr., president of the National Association of Home Builders, said in an interview. In mid-November, a senior Republican on the Financial Services Committee, Richard H. Baker of Louisiana, proposed a compromise -- keeping the current flood zones but requiring coverage for everyone in those areas and in areas adjacent to levees, like those that flooded in New Orleans. But the committee narrowly adopted an amendment from Rep. Gary G. Miller, a Republican and a former homebuilder from California, which mandated a study of the situation while FEMA put together a clearer picture of the expanded zones. In a recent interview, Mr. Miller said he had no problem with requiring people in areas like New Orleans to buy the insurance, and perhaps having them pay more for it. But expanding the flood zones, he said, amounted to going to people in, say, Los Angeles and telling them: ''We need to raise revenue, so we're going to make you buy into a program that you really are never going to need and never benefit from anyway.'' The bill, which the House is expected to take up in the next two weeks, now calls for updating the nation's flood maps, increasing premiums, and reducing subsidies on small businesses and second homes. It would also raise the maximum coverage on a house to $337,000 from $250,000. In all, these changes could bring in perhaps $500 million more a year. Mr. Frank of Massachusetts said there was ''not as much improvement as we'd like, but it's the best we're able to get right now.'' Lobbyists and legislative aides said they expected no major strengthening of the legislation when the Senate takes it up in coming weeks. Around the country, opposition to expanding the program seems to be growing. In Michigan, Representative Miller said she was so angry about the program's inequities that she was considering urging that the state withdraw from it. People in her rarely flooded district, she said, had paid four times more in premiums than they had received in claims in the past 10 years. By contrast, even before Hurricane Katrina, homeowners in just three hurricane-prone states -- Florida, Louisiana and Texas -- had received nearly half the money paid by the program since 1978, federal figures show. Some experts say the program needs to shift from its ''one size fits all'' approach, which uses the same standards to set rates and the size of flood zones around the nation, to one that takes into account the degree of risk in each area, much as a private insurance plan would. But program officials say they do not believe they have enough history of claims in many areas to make reliable distinctions. Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, said the shock of Hurricane Katrina had provided ''a unique opportunity for quantum reform'' of the flood program. But he said the steps now being contemplated ''will do relatively little to protect people who live in flood zones and to protect taxpayers around the country.'' Looming over the debate are the warnings from meteorologists. Christopher W. Landsea, science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center, says warmer ocean temperatures and less disruptive wind currents could make the next two or three decades much more active for hurricanes. And scientists at Colorado State University recently predicted that there could be as many as five intense hurricanes this year. The chance of one striking the Gulf Coast is nearly 50 percent."
"It begins as a conversation, perhaps over dinner, at the end of the day: Where are you going this year? Then, on to the specifics. Which relative? Which hotel? How many suitcases? As a symptom of the general uneasiness here, this year's hurricane evacuation talk ranks among the most acute. Within it are the immediate and long-term threats: the unnamed storm everyone may soon have to flee, and the grim likelihood that the next big one could be the knockout punch for this struggling city. ''Everybody I talk to asks, 'What and where is your escape pod?' '' said Joseph Maselli Jr., a lawyer downtown. ''The talk at lunchtime and in elevators is not, 'What route,' but, 'How soon are you going to leave, what's your plan, where are you going to go?' '' Never has a coming hurricane season generated as much anxiety, many here say. The official start to the season is Thursday but the unofficial worrying has long since begun. On top of the ever-present reminders of last year's catastrophe -- ruined neighborhoods, piles of debris, empty streets -- the new threat is proving to be too much for some. Everyone here, it seems, knows someone who is picking up and leaving New Orleans for good. Many who swear they will not abandon the city have at least set up an alternative home-place somewhere else. Mr. Maselli said he knew ''dozens'' of people who had already secured a getaway spot -- an apartment or a modest second home. ''It's the fear of a second big shoe dropping this quickly,'' he said. ''Everyone says, 'Please, God, don't hit us this year.' '' Mr. Maselli and his wife have been fixing up a family home in Natchez, Miss., up the river, as their hurricane getaway. The fear may be particularly acute among those relatively unaffected by Hurricane Katrina -- people living in the Uptown neighborhood, for instance. Will it be their turn next? Might the Mississippi River levees fail this time? ''Everyone I talk to is filled with a great deal of anxiety,'' said Anne Milling, who started Women of the Storm, a group that seeks to bring attention to continuing problems from Hurricane Katrina. ''I think it's going to be difficult this year,'' Mrs. Milling said. ''Most all of our friends have made plans. It's remarkable to me: people who have never even thought about it have made plans. I think that now people are looking at a lot of things differently.'' At a social gathering this week, ''it was discussed tremendously,'' Mrs. Milling said. ''I couldn't get over it. That was the conversation: 'Where are we going to go?' '' Such discussions often end with a vow not to return to the same place as last year, because it was not enough like New Orleans. A recently completed survey by the University of New Orleans on attitudes after Hurricane Katrina detected unprecedented levels of anxiety about what lies ahead for this city, particularly compared with a similar sampling three years ago. ''I can't tell you how many people are devising an exit strategy,'' said the director of the survey, Susan Howell, a political scientist. ''They don't see a future. Life is too stressful.'' Strikingly, Dr. Howell said, the random survey of 470 people in Orleans and Jefferson Parishes, conducted in March and April, was carried out among ''people in the best conditions,'' those with relatively intact dwellings. Though much of the political talk has focused on how to get people to return to the city, Dr. Howell said she noted a challenge that is perhaps equally serious, and that had gone largely unnoticed: ''the steady drip out,'' particularly of middle-class people who see an economy years away from recovery. The daily strain of life among the ruins is proving too much for many people. Jay and Lin Kayser, a doctor and a teacher, respectively, live on one of the few unflooded blocks near Lake Pontchartrain -- an island of relative normality. ''Between my street and Freret Street,'' several miles to the south, Dr. Kayser said, ''all of that was decimated. And that's our world.'' He and his wife are leaving New Orleans, after decades here. ''The thought of me being 57, waiting for it to be normal again -- it's an emotional thing,'' Dr. Kayser said. ''I just don't want to worry about hurricanes and flooding when I'm 70. I just decided I didn't have it in me to stay.'' Another doctor who is departing for good, a resident of unflooded Uptown, spoke of doing volunteer cleanup work in one of the hard-hit areas. ''It was heartbreaking,'' said the doctor, Sam Money. ''It was one of these things where, we live in a nice little cocoon, but so much of the city was devastated.'' Still, for everyone leaving, or thinking of doing so, thousands more are preparing to hunker down, or at least get ready for another temporary exile. At the hurricane-preparation stands of stores like Lowe's, and at sporting goods stores selling canoes, boats and boots, clerks report a steady though unpanicked business, so far. When the first storms strike the Gulf of Mexico this year, Vera Triplett, a resident of the city's hard-hit Gentilly section, plans to be ready. ''Our philosophy is, if we need to go, we go,'' Ms. Triplett said. Her plans for evacuating are far more precise, ''thought out,'' than they have ever been, said Ms. Triplett, vice president of her neighborhood's civic association. But planning has not dispelled worry. ''There is an underlying fear and anxiety,'' she said, ''because most of the people around here are die-hard New Orleanians.'' Some people plan to leave for the entire hurricane season -- an approach that harks back to the 19th century, when yellow fever killed thousands here and many abandoned New Orleans for the months when it was likely to be dangerous. Ann Strub and her husband, Dick, have bought a house in North Carolina. They are leaving New Orleans on Thursday, and they will not return until hurricane season ends. ''We've got lists of everything were going to take,'' Mrs. Strub said. ''Mainly lots of papers.'' A resident of Esplanade Avenue, the grand old Creole boulevard, she came through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed, but now, like many others here, she is prepared for the worst. ''If it floods in the French Quarter, we're done for,'' Mrs. Strub said. ''Our whole world is different,'' she continued. ''We live differently. It's very scary.''"
"Homeowners in Michigan have been getting some surprising news lately from their insurance companies -- their premiums are going down as insurers fight for their business. Not so for the owners of homes on the coast from Texas as far north as Cape Cod -- their premiums are going up, if they are lucky enough to keep their policies. Call it the Katrina effect. As the nation's home insurers prepare for an expected onslaught of powerful hurricanes over the next decade or so, they are trying to woo new customers in the heartland of America, where hurricanes rarely if ever tread, to make up for lost revenue from the tens of thousands of customers they are abandoning on the coasts. Rates have begun to drop in the Midwest and West, and insurance experts say they expect the trend to spread across most of the interior of the country. Allstate, for example, has cut rates in Michigan by an average of 16.5 percent in the last six months and lowered rates in Montana by 14.8 percent. But in places like Long Island and Cape Cod as well as the coasts in the Southeast, insurers are doubling prices for some customers and refusing to sell new policies or renew old ones. Recently, State Farm, the largest home insurer, sought an increase averaging 71 percent for home insurance in Florida. The insurers have been raising prices and cutting back coverage for homes in Florida and the Gulf Coast for years. But now, they have begun to apply the same measures in coastal areas that have not experienced a devastating storm in decades. ''The insurers simply can't bet the entire farm on insuring the coastal areas,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. They ''are looking to the rest of the country as an opportunity for profitability.'' The changes are the most sweeping in the home insurance business in decades. For the first time, the insurers are effectively creating a two-zone system, with homeowners along the coast struggling to get coverage at any price while those inland choose the least expensive among competing offers. The insurers' measures are infuriating consumer advocates, who say the cutbacks and price increases are unnecessary. ''They're overreacting,'' said J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. The risk suddenly seems greater to the insurers, Mr. Hunter said, partly because they have begun to base their calculations on short-term projections rather than long-range weather patterns. ''They're supposed to bring stability, but that's not happening,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''They're putting short-term profits ahead of people. It's because of hurricanes. But some people haven't had a hurricane for years and they're being dumped. That's not right.'' Until recently, it would not have occurred to the insurers to look inland for profits because they were losing money on home insurance everywhere. In fact, home insurance used to be sold as a loss-leader to attract customers for more lucrative auto insurance. But after a surge in fraudulent claims pushed auto insurance into the red, the insurers decided to overhaul the two lines of coverage. So, in the last few years, the home insurers raised rates and reduced benefits all across the country. Claims fell in many places, according to Jeff Rieder, the president of the Ward Group, a national insurance consulting company in Cincinnati, as some customers chose policies with higher deductibles to offset the increased prices. Also, he said, some homeowners decided not to file claims for routine damage, worried that their policies might not be renewed. Now, home insurers are making money everywhere but in hurricane territory. Auto insurance is also doing well. So strong has the home insurance business become that the insurers ended 2004 with a profit, even after $15 billion in hurricane losses. The losses from Hurricane Katrina and other storms in 2005 were almost double, $28 billion, and still, insurance experts say, the business is expected to show a profit. Mr. Hartwig of the Insurance Information Institute said about half the hurricane losses were covered by reinsurance that insurers bought to protect themselves. Now, the strategy on home insurance is to stanch the coastal losses and stoke the inland profits. From the insurers' perspective, even though tornadoes and hailstorms are common in the Midwest, the damage pales in comparison with that from a major hurricane. Mr. Rieder said he found in an informal survey that home insurers were reducing rates in a dozen states, including Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and the Dakotas. Nationwide Insurance said it had dropped its rates an average of 3.9 percent in Indiana and 3.15 percent in Michigan. Michael Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate, said his company, saw ''good opportunities to grow our homeowners' business in the central part of the United States.'' Himanshu I. Patel, a senior vice president dealing with home insurance at the Liberty Mutual Insurance Group in Boston, said in an interview, ''In Illinois, we want as much business as we can write.'' For 25 years, from 1970 to 1995, few big hurricanes hit the United States. During that time the coastal economies boomed with new houses, apartment buildings and office towers. Now, meteorologists say, the country is in the midst of a 20- to 40-year cycle of more and stronger hurricanes that puts all those buildings, and insurance company finances, in jeopardy. Storm experts are debating whether the increase in hurricane activity is a result of global warming or a shift in warm ocean currents that have historically alternated in the Atlantic Ocean over at least the last century. But they are unanimous that the country is in for a long run of powerful storms. This season, from June to November, nine hurricanes are expected, five of them major, compared with a historical average of two major hurricanes in a season going back to 1950. When insurance companies refuse to provide coverage, the states offer bare-bones policies through insurance pools or state-run companies. But in Florida and Louisiana, the state-run companies are on the verge of collapse. In Mississippi, the officials who run the state insurance agency have told regulators they need to raise rates fivefold to remain in operation. Edward Liddy, the chief executive of Allstate, and Florida officials have been campaigning for a federal program to take the strain off insurers and provide guarantees that home insurance will remain available to everyone. The insurers are taking the toughest measures in Florida, which has been hit by more hurricanes than any state. On May 12, in addition to requesting a sharp increase in rates, State Farm said it was eliminating hurricane coverage for 39,000 customers near the beaches and getting out of the business of insuring condominium and co-op complexes in the state. At the same time, Allstate said it was cutting back on its exposure in the state by transferring 215,000 customers to two other, smaller companies. Even before Hurricane Katrina, the insurers had been cutting back on coverage on Cape Cod, the nearby islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket and the rest of the Massachusetts shore. This spring, they began pulling back from Long Island and New York City. Even though New York rarely gets hurricanes, the upturn in hurricane activity and the recent heavy losses have reminded insurers of a 1938 storm known as the Long Island Express, which leveled stretches of Long Island and went on to hit several New England states. Mr. Trevino, the Allstate spokesman, said his company believed that the chances of a major hurricane hitting Long Island in the next few years have greatly increased. ''We're the largest insurer in the state,'' he said, ''and our exposure to catastrophic loss in New York is higher than we'd like it to be.'' As a result, Allstate is refusing to renew 28,000 policies in Long Island, Westchester County and the five boroughs of New York City and is no longer taking on new home insurance customers there. Beginning in June, said Joe Case, a spokesman for Nationwide, ''we are not writing new policies in eastern Long Island or on any property within 2,500 feet of the coast'' in the rest of the state. Other companies are pulling back on their coverage in New York, too. Mr. Case said Nationwide was also cutting back on sales of new policies to residents near the coasts in Maryland and Virginia. The cutbacks are disruptive for customers, and some say the insurers may be hurting themselves. Jeffrey A. Hornstein, an investment banker at Peter J. Solomon, said that when Allstate told him it was not renewing coverage on his home in Sagaponack on Long Island, he called another insurance agent and three days later shifted coverage on the house plus his two cars and his apartment in the city to the American International Group. ''I don't think this was a good business decision for Allstate,'' he said. ''They're going to lose a lot of other business. They didn't lose one policy in my case, they lost four. I'm a mile from the beach. What's the potential for loss out here if the last big hurricane was in 1938? This isn't South Florida.'' For the insurers, which rely on computer models of likely hurricane strikes, the danger is very real. But a broad swath of the United States will never see a hurricane. ''You can have bad years in the Midwest,'' said Mr. Patel of Liberty Mutual. ''But they will not bring you to the brink of catastrophe. The risk is different, an order of magnitude different.''"
"In the days before the July 4 launching of the space shuttle Discovery at Cape Canaveral, Fla., summer thunderclouds and the threat of rain caused NASA to postpone it twice, each pause costing about $1 million. Space agency officials gave a collective shrug and pointed out what every Floridian knows: afternoon thundershowers are as much a part of life there as heat and mosquitoes. On the day the shuttle finally lifted off, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said that in Florida, ''if you get one day out of three in the summer when you can launch, that ain't bad.'' But one might ask why shuttles must be launched from such a chancy place at all. And showers are the least of the weather problems faced by the Kennedy Space Center and three other NASA facilities that are a crucial part of the manned space program: all four face a real threat of damage from hurricanes. Space experts say the choices of the sites for the most important facilities arose from a blend of sound science and hardball politics. Take the Johnson Space Center here, which runs the human spaceflight program. Last year it had to be shut down as Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf of Mexico coast, with management of the International Space Station temporarily passed to Russian flight controllers. The storm ultimately turned to the north and east, but the incident underscored the site's vulnerability. Not for nothing, said John M. Logsdon, the director of the space policy institute at George Washington University, is the site called the Johnson Space Center, as in Lyndon B. -- though he said that the placement had more to do with the efforts of Houston's powerful longtime congressman Albert C. Thomas. The Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, where the shuttles are put through their final assembly and launched, was hit by four hurricanes in 2004 alone. Each left a mark, with one ripping 820 large siding panels from the Vehicle Assembly Building, a gargantuan structure 525 feet tall. According to NASA documents, the building was designed to withstand winds of 114 miles per hour, the equivalent of a weak Category 3 hurricane. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that this year's hurricane season will be very active, with as many as 16 named storms, 8 to 10 of which could become hurricanes and 4 to 6 of those that could be Category 3 or higher. Both the John C. Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss., and the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans were struck by Hurricane Katrina last year. Several buildings were damaged at Stennis, where the space shuttle's engines are tested. At Michoud, heroic efforts to keep drainage pumps operating through the storm prevented the swamping of the site, which makes the shuttle's bright orange fuel tank. Hundreds of workers at the two facilities lost their homes. The Stennis center was named for John C. Stennis, the Mississippi senator famed for his willingness to use his seniority to benefit his state. As for launching from Florida, Dr. Logsdon said, referring to President John F. Kennedy, ''the fact that Senator George Smathers of Florida was one of Kennedy's drinking and carousing buddies may not have been irrelevant.'' But each of the facilities has sound reasons for its location as well, Dr. Logsdon said. Florida offers advantages for launching missiles and spaceships, which is why the Air Force already had a missile range at Cape Canaveral when NASA came along. Firing off the eastern coast of Florida means that rockets can be launched over water -- and if something goes wrong, there are no people below to be hurt. Of course, rockets can be fired west across the ocean from sunny California as well -- but Florida has physics on its side. Shooting to the east follows the rotation of Earth, and launching relatively close to the Equator gives a speed boost to orbit, a kind of running start derived from the greater circumference of the globe toward its midpoint. Even in 1865, the novelist Jules Verne saw the benefits of launching from Florida, and in ''From the Earth to the Moon,'' he put the massive gun for his fictional spaceshot there. Verne envisioned a competition for space activities between Tampa, Fla., and Galveston Bay in Texas. Once the real-life space program had chosen to launch its rockets from Florida, the plants that made them needed to be relatively convenient to the site. The external tanks are too large to transport by rail or highway, so they are taken to Florida by special barge along the adjacent Intracoastal Waterway, which runs up to the Michoud plant. While the choice of New Orleans for that assembly plant may well have had something to do with the influence of Louisiana lawmakers, Dr. Logsdon called it ''an honest technical decision.'' A former factory for military vehicles for World War II, Michoud had remarkable features -- including a building with 43 acres under one roof -- that were more important than politics, he said. And he said the Stennis center filled the need for ''a place out in the country where you could make a lot of noise,'' from the testing of the Saturn V engines onward. The Johnson Space Center, however, could have been built in any number of places, and sites around the nation were considered, said Christopher Kraft, who served as a flight director in the early days of the space program. The program had been managed from Virginia at first. ''The reason we came here was because Albert Thomas was head of the Appropriations Committee,'' Dr. Kraft said. Many of the engineers in Virginia wanted to stay there, he recalled, but the program director, Robert R. Gilruth, who would become head of the Houston center, said about their senior senator, Harry Flood Byrd, a conservative Democrat, ''What has Mr. Byrd ever done for the space program?'' Dr. Kraft said he and the other engineers soon came to love the Houston area, adding, ''The people went out of their way to make sure we were happy here.'' Mr. Griffin, in an interview, said NASA had simply learned to live with hurricanes. ''We have a lot of facilities in the Southeast,'' he said. ''The Southeast is vulnerable to hurricanes. That's not news.'' The role of politics in placing space facilities did not mean the decisions were bad ones, Mr. Griffin said. ''You can always say that politics was a factor,'' he said, ''but even from a perspective of 40 or 50 years now removed from when these centers were put where they were put, they were good decisions.'' Ultimately, ''we just have to live with hurricane risks,'' he said, adding, ''When it comes time to upgrade facilities, we're going to have to try to harden things.'' Patrick Scheuermann, the chief operating officer of the Michoud plant in New Orleans, said: ''Obviously, we are where we are, and we're always going to be susceptible to hurricanes. We're going to have to be prepared as well.''"
"THE portraits of two people dear to the only president of the Confederate States of America arrived from the South bearing the fresh brushstrokes of Hurricane Katrina. With unblinking eyes, the subjects now peer past fresh sand scrapes and water marks to take in unfamiliar and once hostile terrain: the North. The damaged portraits rest on easels in a conservation studio at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They are not alone. Here, paintings by the Dutch master Frans Hals; there, a work by the Italian master Mattia Preti; and before them, staring back, two New York University graduate students scrutinizing Katrina's handiwork. The students, Winnie Murray, 25, and Sayaka Fujioka, 23, embrace the conservation tenet of knowing as much as possible about your subject. ''When you understand the person, you'll have a sense of how to restore the picture,'' their professor, Michele Marincola, says. ''The picture looks back at you, so knowing something about that person is a way to start the dialogue.'' That dialogue naturally begins with: Who was Jefferson Davis? If the students were from Mississippi or Louisiana, they would recognize the name instantly, and not only because it appears on roads, banks and schools. He was the disgraced president of the Confederacy, the hollow-cheeked martyr of the Lost Cause. His last home, Beauvoir, in the Mississippi city of Biloxi, is a Southern shrine. But Ms. Murray and Ms. Fujioka are both from Ohio, a thousand miles in distance and history from Biloxi. If they ever learned about Davis -- about his Mexican-American War heroics, his embrace of slavery, his ignominious capture, his two years of imprisonment without trial -- they long ago forgot him. Through a conservation program underwritten by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, they set out to learn. Who was Jefferson Davis? Who were Sarah Dorsey and Joseph Davis, the subjects of these two portraits that once hung in Beauvoir? And what, exactly, happened to Beauvoir? When Katrina rocked the Mississippi coast last August, it claimed Beauvoir as one of its many casualties. The hurricane's surge obliterated several buildings on the estate, gutted the first floor of the presidential library and museum, all but ruined the 50-acre grounds, and tore the roof and porches from the antebellum mansion that was Davis's last home. Many artifacts were lost in the storm-tossed swell, including the Davis family's two carriages and the saddle Davis used during the Mexican-American War. ''We found one stirrup,'' says Richard Flowers, Beauvoir's curator. MANY other artifacts were damaged, including two portraits: those of Joseph Davis, Davis's beloved eldest brother, and Sarah Dorsey, a novelist and wealthy socialite who believed that Jefferson Davis had been mistreated after the war. She invited him to live on her Beauvoir estate while he wrote his memoirs, then bequeathed the property to him after she died in 1879. The close relationship between Davis and Dorsey bedeviled his wife, Varina, who was not happy that Dorsey took notes for Davis during his research and writing. ''No question,'' Mr. Flowers says. ''There was no sexual activity going on, but Mrs. Davis was a very jealous woman, especially of the president's time.'' Mr. Flowers often refers to Jefferson Davis as ''the president.'' Sarah Dorsey gave her portrait, this portrait, to the former Confederate leader as a token of her admiration. And now it sits, damaged, in New York, being scrutinized by two young women from the North who didn't know who Jefferson Davis was, much less Sarah Dorsey. The students have only begun their work, with Ms. Murray focusing on the Sarah Dorsey, and Ms. Fujioka concentrating on the Joseph Davis. Beyond conducting background research on their subjects, they have X-rayed and photographed the portraits to reveal those brush strokes of Katrina. Standing in front of the Davis portrait, Ms. Fujioka points out the Gulf Coast dirt and debris, courtesy of Katrina, as well as some shrinking and buckling caused by protracted exposure to moisture. The first job might be to remove surface coatings, she says. ''Then we can start thinking about how to flatten these buckles and cleavages.'' As for the Dorsey portrait, Ms. Murray has found dirt and water marks, as well as the scratches left by storm-blasted sand. She also sees wrinkling in the red of Dorsey's frilly dress. ''We are going to lay it flat and use an adhesive,'' she says. ''Hopefully, it will be happy with that.'' This small piece of post-Katrina recovery -- a study in North and South, apart and entwined -- will continue for another month or so. Then, when Beauvoir is prepared to receive them, the portraits will be sent south, where they belong. About New York E-mail: dabarry@nytimes.com"
"Ten climate experts who are sharply divided over whether global warming is intensifying hurricanes say that this question, a focus of Congressional hearings, news reports and the recent Al Gore documentary, is a distraction from ''the main hurricane problem facing the United States.'' That problem, the experts said yesterday in a statement, is an ongoing ''lemming-like march to the sea'' in the form of unabated coastal development in vulnerable places, and in the lack of changes in government policies and corporate and individual behavior that are driving the trend. Whatever the relationship between hurricanes and climate, experts say, hurricanes are hitting the coasts, and houses should not be built in their path. But coasts are attractive places to live, and political pressures on states and Congress tend to result in discounted insurance costs for property in harm's way, the statement said. The scientists added that reimbursement for losses can spur more building in the wrong places. ''Federal disaster policies,'' they said, ''while providing obvious humanitarian benefits, also serve to promote risky behavior in the long run.'' ''These demographic trends are setting us up for rapidly increasing human and economic losses from hurricane disasters, especially in this era of heightened activity,'' they concluded, stressing that a storm like Hurricane Katrina or worse ''was (and is) inevitable even in a stable climate.'' The statement was posted yesterday at wind.mit.edu/emanuel/home.html. The scientists, several of whom had publicly debated the hurricane-climate connection in recent months, said they were concerned that the lack of consensus on the climate link could stall actions that could cut vulnerability -- no matter what is influencing hurricane trends. Philip J. Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University who disputes the idea that global warming is linked to stronger storms, said the social and economic trends were completely clear. ''There is likely to be an increase in destructiveness from tropical cyclones regardless of whether they are getting more intense or not,'' he said yesterday. ''This is largely due to the increase in coastal population and wealth per capita in hurricane-prone areas.'' Kerry A. Emanuel, a climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drafted the statement and conducted one of several recent studies asserting that the building energy of hurricanes in recent decades was probably related to human-driven warming of the seas. ''We as a community have said for a long time that this is a big social problem right now,'' Dr. Emanuel said in an interview. ''A lot of us are tired of the climate question being set up as a bigger conflict than it is.''"
"This time a year ago, the river that separates southeast Texas and Louisiana reflected the blossoms of Fourth of July fireworks. The next month, Hurricane Katrina evacuees streamed across that river and were greeted by Orange with food, shelter and hugs. People here just could not imagine. Three weeks later they could, as Hurricane Rita sent nearly all 19,000 residents fleeing north. When they returned to their small city, which calls itself ''the sweetest taste of Texas, any way you slice it,'' the taste of Orange hinted of salt -- maybe from the Gulf of Mexico, maybe from something else. Gary's Cafe still sports a portrait of the Duke himself, John Wayne, squinting through the cigarette haze of pilgrims. The Farmers' Mercantile still sells feed for the cows and Bit-O-Honey for the kids. The Dairy Queen on U.S. 90 is still sprinkled with teenagers, lingering, longing. At the Orange Public Library, the head librarian, Brenna Manasco, walks on new carpet under a repaired roof. In his restored studio, C. Delle Bates is painting again, but only angels at the moment. And throughout the city, as a persistent rain fell, thoughts turned again to Rita; to forecasts of Fourth of July wetness; and to a boy no one knew as Benjamin. That's because they knew him best as Bubba, or Willie, or Dewayne, and you should have seen him carrying the football on those Friday nights. He always fell forward. When word came last September of Hurricane Rita's approach, the city had little problem persuading people to get out of town. ''I think what happened in New Orleans shocked people,'' said Shawn Oubre, the city manager. ''So when we asked people to leave, they left.'' Only to return to an Orange with an altered taste. The hurricane damaged more than half of the houses and more than two-thirds of the businesses. It peeled back a third of the library roof, poured water on a shelf of old mysteries and deposited a single blue crab in the stacks. It knocked askew the First Presbyterian Church's massive copper cover for what is said to be the country's only opalescent glass dome, and punched holes beside 3 of the 16 angels depicted in the stained glass. Beyond the destruction of the Buckley & Son fabrication shop, beyond the extensive damage to the Ford dealership and the Wells Fargo bank and the Dairy Queen, the starkest change to Orange was a sense of its having been stripped bare, now that thousands and thousands of its soaring cedars, oaks and pines -- most too large at the trunk to hug -- had toppled like saplings. Few missed the irony. More than a century ago, Orange sprouted from the surrounding forests to become a lumber capital. Long after shipbuilding and chemicals came to define the city, the trees continued to shade Orange under a private canopy, providing respite from the relentless muggy heat. Then, just like that, Hurricane Rita turned those plants of comfort into weapons of destruction that crushed houses, toppled power lines and blocked roads. ''The most notable difference to me is the skyline,'' said Ms. Manasco, the librarian. ''It wasn't so much the trees on the ground. It was the sky.'' Gradually, Orange was able to achieve an approximation of its former self, but only because it had been spared by a last-minute twist and shift that spun the storm surge toward unfortunate Cameron Parish in Louisiana. Orange was lucky, considering. More than a million cubic yards of debris, much of it trees, was hauled away, though more still needs to be picked up. Most of the blue tarps over damaged roofs gradually gave way to new shingles, though fights with insurance and construction companies continue to be waged. The library reopened in February, the Dairy Queen in April. The city made the best of it. An artist carved animal figures from fallen timber. Gary Stelly, owner of the local radio station, KOGT-AM, printed T-shirts for people to announce they had survived the hurricane. Prison inmates cleaned up debris from the properties of elderly residents, some of whom moved away for good. With the Duke peering over his shoulder, Winford Smith, the owner of Gary's Cafe, said the city had actually improved. ''New face-lifts, new looks, new paint jobs,'' he said. ''The town is looking much better.'' Still, a sense of the irreplaceably lost clings like the humidity. Linda Warner, a longtime administrator at Little Cypress-Mauriceville High School, the keeper of the all-important ring of keys, lives near the school. She said that with the absence of trees, ''the exterior of everything is so different.'' ''For example, I can see the lights for the football stadium,'' she said. ''I could never see the lights before.'' And she can still see him under those lights, the boy no one called Benjamin, helmet gleaming, dressed in the green and gold of the Battlin' Bears. The nicest young man, above average in grades and comportment, but put him on that football field and he became, as Mrs. Warner said, ''a determined little sucker.'' His old coach, David Williams, sees him too, refusing to wilt during practice drills in soupy, 100-degree heat. His best friend, Jerald Monceaux, sees him in the locker room at halftime, wearing a determined look of ferocity that cowed even teammates. And his old quarterback, Buster Ascol, sees him in one game -- against Liberty, maybe, or maybe Kirbyville -- when the fullback he called Dewayne the Pain was hit three times, kept his balance with one hand on the ground and the other clutching the ball, and ran 40 yards for a touchdown. ''He always had this goofy-looking smile,'' Mr. Ascol said. ''This goofy smile that said: it can get a lot worse; be thankful for what you had. He said it without speaking it.'' A few days after graduating in 1994, the boy-man enlisted in the Marine Corps. He returned to Orange two years ago for his class's 10-year reunion at the Sunset Grove Country Club; still Dewayne, still a marine. Then he went away again. Several days ago, word arrived that a Staff Sgt. Benjamin D. Williams, of Orange, had been killed in Iraq during his third tour. People paused awhile before making the connection between man and city. ''I didn't even know his name was Benjamin,'' his old coach said. A memorial service for the boy better known as Bubba, or Willie, or Dewayne the Pain, is scheduled for Saturday in this storm-changed city. But its Fourth of July fireworks were at risk of being canceled, because of weather. This is the last in a series of articles that head west from Alabama along U.S. 90, through the towns, counties and parishes still struggling to recover from last year's destructive hurricanes.

"THE GREAT DELUGE Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. By Douglas Brinkley. Illustrated. 716 pp. William Morrow/ HarperCollins Publishers. $29.95. BREACH OF FAITH Hurricane Katrina and the Near Death of a Great American City. By Jed Horne. 412 pp. Random House. $25.95. When Hurricane Katrina reached the coastal town of Buras, La., on Monday, Aug. 29, 2005, there was no mistaking its power. Starting as a tropical depression, it had first made landfall near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., feeding on the moisture-rich Everglades as it headed west into the Gulf of Mexico. By Saturday, Aug. 27, Katrina's fierce winds and plummeting barometric pressure had served notice of its deadly intent. That evening, Max Mayfield of the National Hurricane Center warned the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, that his city was in peril. ''He said, 'Mr. Mayor, I've never seen a storm like this,' '' Nagin recalled, adding, ''Max scared the crap out of me.'' Hurricanes draw strength from warm, open water, making the gulf an ideal host. Camille in 1969 packed winds of nearly 190 miles per hour; the Galveston hurricane of 1900, America's deadliest natural disaster, killed more than 8,000 people. Recently, as gulf waters have become even warmer, the storms have grown larger and more intense. Katrina would pummel an area the size of Britain -- 90,000 square miles. The hurricane hit Buras with a storm surge two stories high before moving north toward New Orleans, 63 miles away. In its path were the vanishing wetlands that serve to buffer inland communities from an onrushing storm. As it reached the city's edge, Katrina veered eastward, sparing New Orleans a direct hit as it closed in on the Mississippi coast. Though windows popped from buildings and power went out, there was a moment when it seemed that New Orleans had dodged a bullet. And then, as the sun reappeared, the water began to rise. In his preface to ''The Great Deluge,'' Douglas Brinkley writes, ''My hope is that this history, fast out of the gates, may serve as an opening effort in Katrina scholarship.'' He needn't worry. A prolific author, known for publishing at breakneck speed, Brinkley has put his skills to good use by interviewing hundreds of Katrina survivors, disaster responders and public officials, and then weaving their disparate stories into a seamless narrative of the hurricane's momentous first week. It's a microhistory, logging in at more than 700 pages, but its thick detail provides a ground-level view of human behavior far richer than the breathless news reports that stunned and shamed the nation in the summer of 2005. For Brinkley, who teaches history at Tulane University in New Orleans, Katrina has a deeply personal edge. One can easily read ''The Great Deluge'' as a morality tale, pitting helpless victims, heroic citizens and a few decent politicians against an inept bureaucracy at every link in the chain. This was an avoidable catastrophe, more the fault of man than of nature, Brinkley says, and those responsible must be held to account. City administrators had done no serious hurricane planning, despite repeated warnings from the scientific community. Residents, for their part, had grown comfortable with the notion that hurricanes always seemed to skirt their city at the last moment, just like Georges in 1998 and Ivan in 2004. Furthermore, they sat behind a levee system built to withstand a Category 3 storm (exactly what Katrina turned out to be). Or so they thought. Still, the initial news reports of Katrina's destruction led many to flee. By Saturday evening, when Mayfield phoned Nagin, an exodus was under way, part of a pattern known as ''contra-flow'' in which all lanes of traffic were directed out of New Orleans. Though Nagin ''strongly advised'' people to leave, he didn't issue a mandatory evacuation order until the following day. By then, about 20 percent of the 460,000 residents were still in the city. Why did they stay? Brinkley's interviews show that some believed Katrina to be yet another false alarm. Others were determined to protect their property against looters. But most were poor, elderly or infirm -- and couldn't leave on their own. Buses were supposed to evacuate them, but many of the drivers had fled the city and hardly anyone knew where to go to be picked up. Among the most infamous photos of the Katrina disaster are the ones showing rows of buses sitting idly on flooded ground. On Monday, Katrina's storm surge overwhelmed the levees, eventually leaving 80 percent of the city underwater. (A recent report by the Army Corps of Engineers accepted responsibility for flaws in design and construction.) Americans were shocked by images of families huddled on rooftops and stranded on highway overpasses. The flooding produced a toxic swill of sewage, chemicals, rats, snakes and bloated corpses. Fires raged because there was no water available in a drowning city. Looters stripped stores of CD's and Nikes as well as bread and diapers. The New Orleans police performed dismally. Some officers fled the city in their cruisers; others stole Cadillacs from a dealership, claiming the cars were needed to transport Katrina victims. If that had been the case, Brinkley says, ''they could have taken the Chevrolets.'' By Tuesday, public order had collapsed. Survivors straggled into the Superdome and the convention center, the refuges of last resort. Brinkley's descriptions of the living conditions, based on richly detailed interviews, are not for the faint of heart. Rarely have so many desperate Americans been so completely abandoned by their government. Planning meant everything, notes Brinkley, who shrewdly lists the preparations of some groups in advance of the storm. The Louisiana S.P.C.A. safely trucked its pets to Houston. By stocking supplies and keeping its staff on site, the New Orleans Zoo saved all but four of its 1,400 animals. Though sustaining terrible losses, the aquarium airlifted penguins and other surviving animals to California; the piranhas were destroyed so they couldn't escape and start breeding in local waters. The United States Coast Guard positioned its boats and aircraft in safe havens just beyond Katrina's reach, allowing it to rescue thousands of victims and earning plaudits as ''the little agency that could.'' These are the exceptions. Brinkley hands down harsh but familiar judgments on others. The White House was remote and unresponsive, viewing natural disaster relief as a distraction from the war on terror. Michael Chertoff, secretary for homeland security, remained willfully ignorant of events in New Orleans, while Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, personified the cronyism that had corrupted FEMA in recent years. Following Brown's behavior during the crisis -- his broken promises about sending buses and supplies, his private concerns about looking stylish and eating well -- is an ordeal. Worse, FEMA routinely prevented others from lending a hand. In one instance, dozens of first responders -- including firefighters and paramedics -- were diverted from New Orleans to Atlanta ''for training on rules against sexual harassment.'' While the government dithered, others filled the breach. Some of Brinkley's best writing describes the heroics of groups like the ''Cajun Navy,'' composed of rural whites who strapped their boats to their pickups and traveled in caravans to New Orleans. Sweeping through black neighborhoods by day, sleeping in their trucks at night, the Cajuns saved close to 4,000 lives. On the local level, Brinkley sees one villain above all. The Ray Nagin we meet in these pages is part coward, part showboat, part Uncle Tom. A pawn of the city's business elite, ''always deferential to whites,'' he sold out his race, Brinkley insinuates, by breaking with ''the civil rights tradition of the city's black leadership.'' When it came to poor people, the book suggests, the mayor couldn't have cared less. It was Nagin who waited too long to order a mandatory evacuation, who left the buses to rot, who turned his back on those who couldn't leave. It was Nagin, ''terrified for his own personal safety,'' who rarely visited the frantic throngs at the Superdome and the convention center, squandering the ''bullhorn moment'' that might have revived flagging spirits in New Orleans. Nothing about him is too small to ignore. Before a meeting with President Bush on Air Force One, an attendant offered Nagin a chance to shower. Having been unable to bathe or change his clothes for several days, he gladly accepted, lingering under the steamy spray. ''What was truly important to Nagin,'' Brinkley writes, ''was that his head was shaved and waxed just right for his photo op. . . . There was something chillingly vain about Nagin's sense of judgment and his coiffing with the underclass suffering all around him.'' Forget the bullhorn moment. In Brinkley's view there is no such thing as an innocent moment for Nagin, who remains, from cover to cover, the fall guy of this book. Those seeking a more condensed take on Katrina may prefer ''Breach of Faith,'' a splendid mix of reporting and commentary by Jed Horne, a metro editor at The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, which won two Pulitzer Prizes in 2006 for its hurricane coverage. The books tread similar ground. Horne, too, sees dysfunctional bureaucracy, not simply racism, as the key to the Katrina disaster, and his judgments of Bush-Brown-Chertoff are equally harsh. But Horne, with a sure grasp of local politics and culture, provides a clearer sense of why things fell apart so completely in New Orleans. Tourists loved the Big Easy. They could stroll the French Quarter without ever seeing the New Orleans of those who served them their meals and cleaned their rooms. The city scraped bottom in every social category. Its politics were so corrupt that major companies loathed doing business there. Nagin promised change, Horne writes, and he made a pretty good start. Elected in 2002, he moved away from ''the politics of backslapping and stuffed envelopes,'' especially alienating black pastors who were used to getting hefty government grants. By 2005, Nagin was legitimately funneling city contracts to a wide range of minority businesses. He had just announced plans to have the Trump organization build a luxury downtown condo tower, a huge ego boost for the city, when Katrina arrived. Though Horne can be merciless in describing Nagin's failures during the storm, he never loses perspective. Given the city's crushing problems, hurricane planning was no one's priority. Indeed, when Nagin urged residents to evacuate during Hurricane Ivan, he was ridiculed after the storm missed the city. Determined not to be another Chicken Little, worried about the legal and economic consequences of closing down hotels and hospitals, Nagin held off too long. But late or not, symbolic or not, his mandatory evacuation order was the first one in the history of New Orleans. Much has happened in the past 11 months. Nagin has been re-elected. The patched-up levees are supposedly stronger, and federal aid is flowing in. The population is two-thirds smaller now, with whites easily outnumbering blacks. How many people will return home from places like Houston, which offer more opportunity, is anyone's guess. New Orleans today is ''a city on the brink,'' Horne concludes, perched ominously between ''revival'' and ''permanent decline.'' Hurricane Katrina Books by Douglas Brinkley and Jed Horne David Oshinsky is the Littlefield professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin. His most recent book, ''Polio: An American Story,'' won this year's Pulitzer Prize for history."
"The Senate voted 87 to 11 Tuesday night to create a new federal entity to replace the much-criticized Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Senate's action came in the form of an amendment to the domestic security budget bill. The new agency, called the Emergency Management Authority, would remain in the Homeland Security Department into which FEMA, which once had cabinet status, was merged in 2003. But in times of major disasters, the new agency would report directly to the president. The Senate also voted on Tuesday to amend the proposed $32.8 billion domestic security spending bill by adding another $648 million for port security to pay for more equipment and personnel to inspect ship containers, and an extra $350 million for border security to buy aircraft and vehicles to help border patrol agents and to enhance border fences. Final passage of the bill by Congress is far from assured. The House is still considering legislation proposed by Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, that would keep FEMA but move it outside the Homeland Security Department, returning it to the more prominent, stand-alone status it had during the Clinton administration. Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who co-sponsored the legislation to change the agency, said the agency's performance after Hurricane Katrina last year was such a national embarrassment that the federal government had no option but to abolish it and replace it with an agency that had new powers and a new name. The Senate bill would also reunite agencies assigned to help prepare for disasters or terrorist attacks with those that respond and help cities or states recover from them, functions now split in different parts of the Homeland Security Department. And it would require creation of larger, better-staffed regional emergency management offices for the new Emergency Management Agency. ''It is not business as usual, but rather a dramatic reform of FEMA,'' Ms. Collins said after the vote. The Department of Homeland Security, which has opposed totally removing the functions handled by FEMA from its control, as one House bill proposes, ended up supporting the Senate legislation, saying it ''wisely reinforces D.H.S.'s ability to operate as a comprehensive, all-hazards agency by keeping FEMA's capabilities within D.H.S.'' Correction: July 19, 2006, Wednesday An article on July 12 about legislation passed by the Senate to reshape the Federal Emergency Management Agency misstated the role proposed for the new agency in times of major disaster. Under the legislation, the director of the new agency, the Emergency Management Authority, would report to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security while serving as the principal adviser to the president on emergency preparedness and response. The agency would not report directly to the president."
"Breach of Faith Hurricane Katrina and the Near Death of a Great American City By Jed Horne 412 pages. Random House. $25.95. There are two Hurricane Katrina deluges to reckon with: the one that hit the city and the one now hitting bookstores. The latter storm surge has barely begun. ''The Great Deluge'' by Douglas Brinkley was written at record speed, yet is thus far the most evocative, soul-shaking account of the calamity. Ivor van Heerden, the prophetic deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, has analyzed the event's scientific and forensic aspects in ''The Storm'' (written with Mike Bryan). CNN and Time are among the news organizations that have commemorated their coverage in book form. Now The Times-Picayune, the New Orleans newspaper, joins the fray. ''Path of Destruction'' is a coming book by two members of its Pulitzer Prize-winning news team, John McQuaid and Mark Schleifstein, with an emphasis on history, climatology and politics. But Jed Horne, a Times-Picayune metropolitan editor, is after the big picture. His ''Breach of Faith'' is an amalgam of the feature stories, news analysis, forensic evidence and backroom power plays engineered by New Orleans's most influential citizens and the hellish ordeals suffered by its least. The model for a book of this scope remains J. Anthony Lukas's ''Common Ground,'' the amazingly multifaceted, gripping and comprehensive account of Boston's racial tensions as seen through the eyes of three very different families. Mr. Horne's book is modeled along similar lines. But while Mr. Horne touches all the necessary bases, his book is thorough without managing to become more than the sum of its miscellaneous parts. What happened to the hometown advantage? Many Hurricane Katrina authors are New Orleans residents, but The Times-Picayune had a special edge. Its coverage of the disaster was so strong that it became the primary news source for other publications. Its feat in continuing to function despite overwhelming obstacles was part of the event's high drama. If ever an author were entitled to insert himself into a news story, Mr. Horne is: he and his newspaper had what Random House calls ''a front-row seat'' for the storm's unfolding horrors. Yet ''Breach of Faith'' is a measured, impersonal, often dispassionate account of news that has since become all too familiar. A Hurricane Katrina book is sure to do certain things. It will cite John M. Barry's 1998 ''Rising Tide,'' about the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, as a model for studying a natural disaster and its wider racial, economic and political ramifications. It will incorporate ghastly, graphic examples of extraordinary suffering. It will refer to the snake-filled muck that swamped the city as ''gumbo.'' It will find controversy in the behavior of New Orleans's mayor, C. Ray Nagin. And it will agree that Michael D. Brown, the director of FEMA at the time the hurricane hit, did do a heck of a job, though that depends on what the meaning of ''heck'' is. ''Breach of Faith'' delivers all of the above. And it incorporates a great many first-person stories, selected with a Noah's Ark approach to diversity as a way of creating a mosaic. Mr. Horne did not conduct all of these interviews himself, and perhaps that's why so many of them lack immediacy. It's indicative of this book's tone that he identifies one assistant as ''the redoubtable Hamilton Simons-Jones, scion of fine journalistic stock and a man acutely sensitive to the ethical issues journalists confront in dealing with the impoverished and disempowered.'' He also describes one photographer's choice between whether to take action or take pictures as ''vexing.'' The book is structured so that certain individuals are visited time and again, creating different narrative threads about aspects of Hurricane Katrina's impact. For such tactics to work, the people cited must become very recognizable to the reader. But Mr. Horne lets most of them remain only moderately familiar. And although the book's separate chapters would seem to be about specific parts of the overall story, their organization is not so succinct. He is apt to mention one aspect of the crisis and then move on to another in ways that meander rather than logically progress. Time sequences are problematic, since Mr. Horne does not attempt the Herculean job of telling this story chronologically. His separation of different narrative threads can be dizzying, since the book may move from post-storm chaos to anticipation of the imminent hurricane. ''Breach of Faith'' works best when its chronology and focus are unmistakable. In detailing the structure of levees and the difficulty of making them sturdy (''Sinking a sheet pile into peat was like trying to make a fork stand up in salad,'' he writes), Mr. Horne successfully concentrates the reader's attention and his own. ''Breach of Faith'' deals with the aftermath of the storm better than it does with the immediate experience of it. Mr. Horne is patient and diffuse enough to fare well with some of the knottier issues raised by the disaster. Questions about insurance practices, possibilities for rebuilding, levee board consolidation and the Army Corps of Engineers' defensiveness about its work practices are dutifully addressed. Mr. Horne also takes issue with Mr. Brinkley's harsh assessment of Mayor Nagin and with the perception of Gov. Kathleen B. Blanco as ineffectual. ''There had always been something deceptive about Blanco,'' he writes, ''a surprise in the discovery, which might take awhile, that she carried a sharp political knife in the folds of her grandmotherly togs.'' But in the end Mr. Horne cannot come up with much of an ending. ''Only this much seemed certain,'' he writes. ''The seeds of whatever future lay ahead had been sown.'' There's no arguing with that. There's not much reason to pay attention to it either. BOOKS OF THE TIMES"
"Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana sent a sometimes blistering letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff late Wednesday asking the federal government to honor its commitment to help evacuate and care for thousands of New Orleans area residents in the event that another major hurricane blows into the region this year. ''We have received no indication from you that staffing, logistics and security for additional shelters have been addressed,'' she wrote in the 18-page letter, in one of many critiques of federal aid she said she had requested, but has still not been promised, in this case referring to a need for additional federally provided emergency shelter space. The letter from Governor Blanco came in response to a request sent by Mr. Chertoff earlier this month that Louisiana officials compile a complete list of the places where federally provided buses will be expected to pick up residents waiting to be evacuated, as well as a list of hospitals or nursing homes that might need evacuation assistance. Ms. Blanco replied with a recitation of what she said were multiple shortcomings in the commitments to date by Mr. Chertoff to comply with requests by the state for needed aid, in terms of evacuating temporary housing trailer complexes set up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and to provide emergency shelter for up to 150,000 Louisiana residents that the Red Cross and the state may not be able to accommodate. ''We must ask again for your assistance that the federal government stands ready to provide contingency sheltering for 150,000 Louisiana residents in the event of a threatened catastrophic event,'' she wrote. The exchange of letters between the governor and Ms. Blanco at times had the appearance of an effort to clarify in advance who should be held responsible if another major storm hits the area and chaos again reigns."
"The death toll from a tropical storm that pummeled southern China rose to 523 on Saturday as the central government dispatched a team of investigators to assess the full scope of the disaster and to determine whether local authorities had deliberately understated the number of dead. The team sent by the Ministry of Civil Affairs was expected to focus on Hunan Province, where local officials initially reported 92 deaths from the storm. But on Friday provincial officials revised the number of fatalities in Hunan to 345 people. The change came after the Chinese media discovered more bodies and questioned whether local officials were hiding the true toll. Faced with such blunt public criticism, the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced Friday that ''those who are responsible for covering up the death toll and the number of missing people will be held accountable,'' according to China Daily, the government's English-language newspaper. Tropical storm Bilis made landfall in southern China more than a week ago, raking the region with powerful winds as heavy rains spawned deadly floods. Storms and flooding are seasonal occurrences in southern China, but damage figures made public on Friday suggested that Bilis had caused heavy damage in six provinces. An estimated 212,000 houses were destroyed, while another 287,000 were damaged. Officials say that 2.95 million people have been evacuated. Economic losses in Guangdong Province alone have been estimated at more than $1 billion. But the full extent of the death toll began to be known only on Thursday after a reporter from China Central Television, or CCTV, filed a story from Pingshi, Hunan. The reporter learned that one village had reported 54 people dead or missing -- even though Pingshi, which includes the village, had only reported 39. By Saturday, the official New China News Agency reported that the city of Zixing, which includes Pingshi, had 197 deaths and 69 people missing. Officials in Zixing blamed communication breakdowns and other problems for the initial undercount of the death toll."
"In a sweeping new study of the causes of the disaster in New Orleans last year, the Army Corps of Engineers concludes that the levees it built in the city were an incomplete patchwork of protection, containing flaws in design and construction and not built to handle a storm anywhere near the strength of Hurricane Katrina. ''The hurricane protection system in New Orleans and southeast Louisiana was a system in name only,'' said the draft of the nine-volume report, released yesterday in New Orleans. Several outside engineering panels that have been critical of the corps have come to similar conclusions, and have found a more extensive chain of flaws in the design, construction and maintenance of the 350-mile levee system. But the 6,113-page report is remarkable for being a product of the corps' own official investigation, which brought together 150 experts from government, academia and business to study what went wrong and how to build better systems for the future. The region's network of levees, floodwalls, pumps and gates lacked any built-in resilience that would have allowed the system to remain standing and provide protection even if water flowed over the tops of levees and floodwalls, the report's investigators found. Flaws in the levee design that allowed breaches in the city's drainage canals were not foreseen, and those floodwalls failed even though the storm waters did not rise above the level that the walls were designed to hold. But the system was also overwhelmed in significant ways by Hurricane Katrina, and some degree of flooding would have happened even if the floodwalls had not been breached by the surging waters, the report stated. ''Regardless of breaching or no breaching, there would have been massive flooding and losses'' from the hurricane, Lewis E. Link, the director of the study and a senior research engineer at the University of Maryland, said in an interview. ''The losses were increased because of the breaching that occurred.'' The investigators found no evidence of negligence or malfeasance by the corps or its contractors, but said the corps had failed to take into account the tendency of the local soil to sink over time, leaving some sections of levee lower than they should have been. The corps did not re-examine the heights of levees even after it had been warned about the degree of subsidence, the report said. Similarly, the corps designed the system to protect New Orleans against a relatively low-strength hurricane, the report found, and did not respond to warnings over the years from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that a stronger hurricane should have been the standard. The report suggested the corps has had trouble keeping up with the fast-changing world of geotechnical engineering, and does not share critical information among its many parts. Although the corps had indications that the floodwalls might fail under intense storm conditions, ''the pieces were not put together to solve the puzzle,'' the report said. More must be done, it concluded, to share information among those who do research and those who design and build systems. The report, which is already being used in the repair and improvement of New Orleans's flood protection, warned that the area ''remains vulnerable'' to any storm with surge and wave conditions like Hurricane Katrina's. The chief engineer of the corps, Lt. Gen. Carl A. Strock, said in an interview that the report showed that ''we missed something in the design,'' particularly in the construction of the drainage canal floodwalls that caused so much of the flooding. According to the report, the corps designers did not anticipate the way the floodwalls would fail as water climbed high against them: in several breaches, including the one at the 17th Street Canal, the force of the water pushed the floodwall back slightly, opening a gap deep into the earthen levee below that allowed water to course down under high pressure and push the wall aside. General Strock did not go so far, however, as to apologize on behalf of the corps for the decades of decisions that went into the system. ''It is what it is,'' he said. ''Call it a mea culpa, or call it a dry recognition, or admission, or whatever -- but we're not ducking our accountability and responsibility in this.'' Nonetheless, he made it clear that he believed outside influences had played a role in the problems of the flood protection system, though he said that did not absolve the corps. As one example, he cited plans by the corps in the 1970's to put large barriers at the narrow openings between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico. The corps backed off from that plan after a court challenge from environmental groups and then proposed floodgates at the city's drainage canals. But local officials of the levee boards and sewerage and water boards blocked that plan, as well. So the corps went with the next fallback plan of building floodwalls in the canals. ''Each time, we backed off,'' General Strock said. ''Each time we did that, we assumed an increment of risk. I don't think anybody looked back and said, 'Risk, risk and risk adds up to unacceptable levels.' '' He said this was not an effort to lay blame at the feet of others, because ultimately the corps had responsibility for what it built. ''At the end of the day, we have to stand by the decisions,'' he said. If the corps builds floodwalls, he said, those floodwalls have to stand up to the test and the system has offer the intended level of protection. ''And we didn't get there,'' he said. The corps announced this week that it had substantially met its goal of repairing the city's hurricane protection system by June 1, the beginning of hurricane season, though there was significant work still to be done, including on two of the three enormous gates at the mouths of the city's major drainage canals. If an unseasonably early hurricane approaches with threats of a storm surge, corps officials say, they will drive sheets of steel across the mouths of the canals and remove the rainwater with portable pumps. That could lead to street flooding, but should prevent the catastrophic breaches that allowed Lake Pontchartrain to pour billions of gallons into the center of the city. A setback was announced this week as a 400-foot section of levee in Plaquemines Parish, south of New Orleans, shifted as it neared completion. The marshy soil of the area could not support the weight of the earthen levee structure, which slumped and bulged. It is being repaired. Robert G. Bea, an engineering expert at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been critical of the corps, said he was impressed by the level of criticism in the report. ''This report has got a tone in it that is not like anything we have seen before,'' Dr. Bea said. ''They're coming forward now.'' But he said he wished that the corps had admitted other failures and gone further in delving into the internal reasons for those failures. A report by Dr. Bea and colleagues, released last month, said organizational dysfunctions within the corps had created an environment with little responsibility or accountability, and within which safety concerns could be easily played down. Yesterday's report did not address that question in depth, but General Strock said it would be dealt with in a subsequent study."
"Harold Polsky and his wife, Barbara, moved to Port Richey, Fla., in 2002 with plans to retire. Now they find themselves in a hurricane-damaged home, spending half their income on a mortgage and skyrocketing insurance rates. ''We figured we were making the last move of our lives,'' said Mr. Polsky, 49, whose three-bedroom home was damaged by Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004. ''Now we're ready to move out of state, and we shouldn't have to.'' Florida is losing its luster for many residents like him, who are scouring for homeowners' insurance after two ferocious hurricane seasons and struggling to pay for what they find. Abandoned by insurers with cold feet and empty pockets, homeowners are increasingly turning to the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, the state-created insurer of last resort, which by law must charge more than private insurers to be noncompetitive. Citizens has picked up 150,000 homeowner policies in Florida since June 2005, said Rocky Scott, a spokesman, and expects to add another 320,000 by the end of the summer. Citizens, created in 2002 as a safety net for homeowners, is now the second-largest insurer in the state, carrying 70 percent of Miami-Dade County policies alone. This summer it anticipates becoming the largest homeowners' insurer in Florida, with 1.2 million policies. Last year, hurricane claims put Citizens $1.73 billion in the red. The Legislature bailed out the company with $715 million from the state surplus. Homeowners are picking up the remaining tab through assessments to their policies, which in some cases are twice as expensive as last year's. In some ways, the higher rates are forcing Florida residents to confront the real costs of living in a hurricane-prone region, and many say life in the tropics may not be worth the price. George Myers, a mortgage broker in St. Petersburg with a modest 1,000-square-foot home built in 1947, was recently dropped by a private insurer because of his house's age. His insurance premiums have gone to $1,350, from $500, Mr. Myers said, and will more than double again by the end of the summer if another Citizens rate increase is approved. Mr. Myers, 52, said he was planning to build a home in Virginia and move there next year. ''The worst that's going to happen there is I get cold,'' Mr. Myers said. ''I don't see it changing or getting any better here.'' Suzanne Litt Lyon, whose insurer declared bankruptcy this year, has searched relentlessly to find a new policy for her eighth-floor apartment in Miami. ''I'm in a pickle,'' Mrs. Litt Lyon said. ''I want to have it for my peace of mind, but do we really need insurance? I just spent $8,000 for storm shutters. We live in this 1961 concrete building that's a fortress. Even if you make a claim, the deductibles are so high that you don't even really make a claim.'' Private insurance rates are not much cheaper. State Farm is asking to increase its homeowners' insurance rates 74 percent on average, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Lynn Martin, a State Farm customer in Punta Gorda, said her premiums could increase to $3,000 a year, from about $2,000. ''I don't know what anyone's going to do who's a working person,'' said Mrs. Martin, who battened her home and survived Hurricane Charley in 2004 with relatively little damage. ''Then you add in the factor of the higher cost of fuel, electricity. Where's it going to stop?'' Homeowners in some hard-hit areas have united and taken their outrage to Tallahassee, the state capital. Fair Insurance Rates in Monroe, a group formed at a backyard party in Key West, now has more than 4,000 members and successfully lobbied to have Citizens' homeowner rates in the Keys frozen at October 2005 levels until the state can review again. Teri Johnston, president of the group, said owners of 1,500-square-foot homes there were typically seeing premiums double to $10,000 or more for wind-storm insurance. They are facing a total home insurance cost of more than $13,000 a year on average, Ms. Johnston said, or about $1,100 a month. Their cries are being heard. Candidates in the race to succeed Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, have made homeowners' insurance a top campaign issue. In addition to bailing out Citizens, the Legislature set aside $250 million this spring to help property owners fortify their homes. Mr. Polsky, president of another homeowners' group, said that was not enough or soon enough. His premium has doubled in the past year, and he faces another increase by summer's end that he does not think he can pay. Without homeowners' insurance, he said, he faces bank foreclosure. ''I may lose my house because of this,'' said Mr. Polsky, who has already boxed up much of his belongings in anticipation of a move. ''If it increases like they propose, I don't know what we will do. Nobody will buy it in the shape it's in, and nobody can pay the insurance.''"
"New Orleans still faces serious street flooding in coming storms because the Army Corps of Engineers has fallen behind in repairing the city's hurricane protection system, Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said in a letter to be sent today to President Bush. Extensive flooding could occur even in heavy rainstorms, Mr. Vitter said, and a hurricane could have enormous consequences for the restoration of New Orleans. ''The threat is, we get significant flooding because of corps failures this hurricane season, and it kills our recovery,'' he said. Echoing concerns of New Orleans activists and officials, Mr. Vitter said the corps had not provided enough pumping capacity to get water out of the city's drainage canals in heavy storms. If the corps must close the new floodgates it built at the mouths of those canals against a storm, street flooding will probably result. Although the corps has largely completed its sweeping project to repair the city's levee system, and is getting pumps in place, it has acknowledged falling behind in the effort to install enough pumps to get large amounts of water out of the drainage canals. The corps has committed to increasing the pumping capacity over time, said Col. Richard P. Wagenaar, the commander of the New Orleans district. There have been ''a whole host of technical issues'' at the cramped, mucky construction sites, Colonel Wagenaar said, but ''the corps has got to do their best to mitigate any future damage.'' But Mr. Vitter said that after months of meetings with the corps, ''there's been no adequate improvement or resolution,'' and that he had ''sort of reached the breaking point.'' The timetable for increasing the pumping capacity keeps slipping, the senator said, and the situation ''has gone from unacceptable to much worse.'' The corps has been intensely focused on preventing a recurrence of the levee breaches that flooded New Orleans last year, which Mr. Vitter called ''the greatest stain on the history of the Corps of Engineers.'' As a result, he said, it has lost sight of the risks of flooding. While not as catastrophic as breaches, he said, ''significant flooding in thousands, or tens of thousands, of people's homes'' could be a crippling blow to the city's efforts to get back on its feet, and could drive even more residents away. Mr. Vitter suggested that the corps might be dragging its feet on the floodgates project because of a reluctance to pour money into a system that is supposed to be in place for only a few years until permanent pumping stations can be erected. Matt McBride, an engineer living in the Broadmoor neighborhood, said the corps's efforts to patch the hurricane protection system had fallen short. ''With the corps,'' Mr. McBride said, ''it's 'Look how hard we're working!' You're working hard, but you've lost sight of the objective. The objective is to keep us dry.'' Dwayne Anthony, another Broadmoor resident and a driver for UPS, said, ''I believe that mistakes were made'' by the corps, ''but I believe they learned from it,'' and have improved the system. ''I believe that in my heart,'' Mr. Anthony said. ''Otherwise, I wouldn't have come back from Houston.''"
"A federal buildings inspection team has found that damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was amplified by a lack of construction standards in the Gulf Coast states, as well as by shoddy building practices. None of the states severely affected -- Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas -- had adopted statewide building codes before the storms last year, according to the team's report, released Friday by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a unit of the Department of Commerce. As a result, many of the collapsed brick walls in the region had not been correctly anchored or reinforced. Shingles blew off roofs because not enough fasteners had been used, or because they had been put in place incorrectly. Dozens of windows shattered on high-rise buildings, as in downtown New Orleans, because nearby buildings were roofed with gravel, forbidden in high-wind areas under standard building codes. Though the 270-page report documents considerable building damage from winds and even more from storm surge, wind speeds did not reach levels that model codes are devised to withstand. The region's roofers, largely unlicensed and unregulated, come in for particularly scathing appraisal in the report. Where roofs were blown off, the team found that the culprit was almost always poor installation. The team found roofers making repairs after the storms in the same faulty manner, and the report urges that a system to ensure education of contractors be put in place. Apart from adopting and enforcing model building codes and taking better account of the potential hazard from storm surge, the agency urged the Gulf states to license, regulate and educate roofing contractors. None of the affected states licensed roofers before the storms. Louisiana has since adopted a statewide building code; some cities, like New Orleans and Lake Charles, La., already had similar codes. Texas adopted the International Building Code in September 2005. Mississippi has no statewide code."
"With another active Atlantic hurricane season predicted in the wake of last year's, which caused havoc in Cancún, right, and other resorts, travel companies are offering storm insurance or vacation guarantees. TNT Vacations (www.tntvacations.com) has added hurricane protection to its $95 Worry-Free travel insurance plan. Travelers who buy it can get a replacement vacation (though there are blackouts) if the original one is substantially interrupted by a hurricane for at least 24 hours. CheapCaribbean.com rolled out a Free Your Mind plan last month that offers a voucher for another trip for cancellations for any reason. Travelers must notify the company of the change at least three hours before scheduled departure to get the credit, which is good for a year. Worry Free Vacations (www.worryfreevacations.com), which sells charter vacations to Mexico and the Caribbean, recently introduced a policy that lets customers rebook their vacation if the National Hurricane Center issues a hurricane watch for their destination. They can then go elsewhere within a week before or after their original departure date, or travel anytime for a $50 fee if booked within 60 days. Sandals and Beaches Resorts (www.sandals.com and www.beaches.com) is renewing its Blue Chip Hurricane Guarantee, which offers guests a full replacement vacation if their stay is interrupted by a hurricane, as defined by the National Hurricane Center. Since the program's inception in 1997, the company says it has paid out more than $5.5 million in replacement vacations. In Transit"
"The Rockaway Peninsula, less than a mile wide for most of its 11-mile length, is not the ideal place to be when a hurricane threatens. And many of its residents remember the northeasters of 1992 and 1993, which brought floodwaters 20 feet north of the boardwalk and offered a cautionary lesson about their vulnerability to a severe storms. Last week, with Alberto, the first named storm of the 2006 hurricane season, all over the news, memories of storms past were much on the minds of residents of the Rockaways and other low-lying areas nearby. Many attended a meeting on Tuesday with officials from the city's Office of Emergency Management in the chandeliered ballroom of a local Knights of Columbus hall. On the agenda was the presentation of a new assistance plan for the post-Katrina era. Going in, residents were still angry about a meeting in January, at which, they said, the agency did little but reiterate old plans. ''Ten years ago, O.E.M.'s plan was to put up coastal evacuation signs, and that was about it,'' said Dolores Orr, chairwoman of Community Board 14, which organized the meeting. Much of the news from officials of the agency was ominous. This year's hurricane season could be especially active, they said before showing animated graphics depicting -- to gasps from the crowd -- how much flooding could be caused in New York by storms of various levels of severity. One PowerPoint slide noted that a Category 3 storm, with winds of up to 130 miles per hour, could produce floodwaters of up to 12 feet at Breezy Point, on the western tip of the peninsula. (More gasps.) The officials then described their new plan. The city has increased its number of hurricane evacuation centers from 23 to 65 and established 509 shelters, a fivefold increase from 2005. Several will be nearby. ''As chair of the public safety committee, I'd like to say this is a big improvement over what we've been offered in the past,'' said Dan Mundy, a Broad Channel resident. ''It's not a perfect plan, but it's a plan.'' Still, concerns about the new strategy quickly emerged. City officials urged residents to take public transportation to evacuation centers during a storm, a suggestion that, in an area with spotty bus and subway service, elicited laughter. One resident wondered aloud when federal help would reach the Rockaways in the event of an emergency. Jonathan Gaska, the community board's district manager, offered a quick rejoinder. ''Yeah,'' he said, ''they did such a great job with Katrina, right?'' JEFF VANDAM NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ROCKAWAYS"
"Billions of federal dollars are about to start flowing into this city after President Bush on Thursday signed the emergency relief bill the region has long awaited. But, with the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina approaching, local officials have yet to come up with a redevelopment plan showing what kind of city will emerge from the storm's ruins. No neighborhoods have been ruled out for rebuilding, no matter how damaged or dangerous. No decisions have been made on what kind of housing, if any, will replace the mold-ridden empty hulks that stretch endlessly in many areas. No one really knows exactly how the $10.4 billion in federal housing aid will be spent, and guidance for residents in vulnerable areas has been minimal. A month into his second term, Mayor C. Ray Nagin has said little about his vision for a profoundly different city. In an interview on Friday, he said it would be six months before a ''master planning document'' was issued to address questions like which areas should be rebuilt, although he suggested that thousands of residents were making that decision on their own. Caution should be the watchword, Mr. Nagin said, months after the apparent demise of a planning committee he set up. ''New Orleans is a very historic city,'' he said. ''We can't come out and just do something quickly.'' But a close collaborator of Mr. Nagin acknowledged that the process has lagged. ''Let's just admit something straight out: we're late,'' said David Voelker, a board member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. Mr. Voelker, who is in charge of the state authority's efforts to coordinate with neighborhood planning, sounded uncertain even about the nature of the master plan. ''I don't know what this master plan is going to say, because I'm not a master planner,'' Mr. Voelker said. The lack of a redevelopment plan and the state of the city's ruined neighborhoods have some worried that the city government has lapsed into the pattern of inactivity for which Mr. Nagin was criticized before last month's election. ''The city desperately needs leadership on planning and housing issues,'' an editorial in The Times-Picayune said last week. ''Without strong guidance from City Hall, crucial decisions about the future of New Orleans will be made by default. Or they won't be made at all.'' In occasional public appearances, the mayor has voiced characteristic optimism. ''Today is another great day in the city of New Orleans,'' he said Wednesday after the A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced a $700 million housing and economic development grant. He called the grant ''an incredible tipping point,'' but offered no specifics about which neighborhoods he was committed to rebuilding. The mayor's flurry of appearances before the election has been sharply curtailed. Streets remain abandoned, sometimes for miles, and blocks are carpeted with trash. ''We do need to have a clear vision from the mayor,'' said Oliver Thomas, the president of the New Orleans City Council. ''Tell us what you're for, or not for. We don't know exactly what neighborhoods he's committed to, kind of committed to, and not committed to.'' Mr. Thomas added, ''We don't know specifically what the roles of the neighborhoods are going to be in the new New Orleans. Can people build anywhere? Can they live anywhere? Are they going to be funded? We don't know that.'' In the absence of a redevelopment vision from the city, residents are pushing ahead on their own, a process likely to be accelerated late this summer when washed-out homeowners begin receiving checks from the federal housing money appropriated by Congress. Whether homeowners who are rebuilding in ruined areas will remain isolated pioneers or will receive city services is still unclear. A few badly damaged neighborhoods have undertaken their own planning efforts. ''The initiatives for planning and rebuilding are coming from the neighborhoods themselves,'' said Pam Dashiell, a member of the Holy Cross Neighborhood Association, in the city's Ninth Ward. The Broadmoor district, with a mix of incomes and races, has plans for converting abandoned dwellings to community use and wants to provide housing incentives for police officers and firefighters. But few neighborhoods are as far along, and none of the efforts are being centrally coordinated. During the recent election campaign, Mr. Nagin and most of his rivals carefully avoided pronouncements on the fate of specific neighborhoods, tiptoeing through a volatile issue that had many residents on edge. But now, critics say, the mayor does not have politics to use as an excuse. ''The election is over, and it's time for governing,'' said State Representative Karen Carter, Democrat of New Orleans. ''He's the mayor, and he has to show that level of leadership and engagement.'' Within a week of his re-election on May 20, Mr. Nagin announced that two ex-rivals from the campaign -- both lawyers, one a Republican and the other a Democrat -- would be aiding him in urgent planning for the city's future. In 100 days, there would be a plan, it was announced. Since then nothing has been heard from either lawyer. One was traveling outside the country this week, and the other did not return calls. In the interview on Friday, Mr. Nagin indicated that the entire city west of the Industrial Canal would be rebuilt, a more optimistic projection than some urban planners had given. As for areas east of the canal, the mayor said that the prosperous New Orleans East area would probably come back and that the flattened homes of the Lower Ninth Ward would probably be replaced by what he called ''multilevel living facilities,'' presumably apartment buildings. Success, he said, is more likely to be defined by what residents do than what the editorial board of The Times-Picayune says. The city's current population of 220,000 is ahead of most projections, he said, and was made possible by his administration's willingness to provide building permits to almost all who asked, in any neighborhood. ''I think that most citizens can make intelligent decisions,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''This city will be rebuilt. Most areas will come back. There are people who are rebuilding.'' Mr. Nagin appears to be counting on a strategy that involves large-scale economic development projects, like one unveiled two weeks ago that called for demolishing a decrepit downtown shopping center and the city's frayed municipal complex and replacing them with a National Jazz Center set in a 20-acre park. Such development promises, largely unfulfilled, were a feature of Mr. Nagin's first term in office. As for the planning body created after the hurricane, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, little has been heard of it for months. The commission's tough plan, unveiled in January and now apparently dead, called for a four-month building moratorium in the hardest-hit neighborhoods while they proved their ''viability.'' Ultimately a new public agency would have been empowered to seize land in areas that failed the challenge, and the city's footprint was to shrink. Mr. Nagin, in the face of a public outcry, almost immediately rejected the plan. Ray Manning, a local architect who played a key role in early planning efforts after the storm and who was a co-chairman of the mayor's neighborhood planning committee, said this week that he had withdrawn from the process. ''I said I would not speak about this issue any longer,'' he said. At a conference at Tulane University this month, Mr. Manning had harsh criticism for the lack of guidance from City Hall. For his part, the mayor in a brief appearance before reporters this week said of the neighborhood planning process, ''That's just about completed.'' Naming Mr. Thomas, the City Council president, as a collaborator, Mr. Nagin said, ''There's a structure we'll be announcing in the next day or so, and we'll move that forward.'' But Mr. Thomas responded: ''I don't know what the structure is. We've talked about some possibilities, but nothing definitively.'' Now, 10 weeks before the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, some residents are losing patience. ''We are entitled to hear something now,'' said LaToya Cantrell, head of the Broadmoor Improvement Association. ''We've been waiting. It's nine months out. We need to know what's going on. We need to know what the process is. The center of my community has yet to return, and this is nine months out. This is ridiculous. This is frustrating.''"
"President Bush's nominee to run the Small Business Administration moved closer to confirmation Wednesday after he promised to reinvigorate the agency, which has come under fire for its delayed response in processing disaster loans after last year's Gulf Coast hurricanes. The nominee, Steven C. Preston, is a former executive vice president at ServiceMaster, which owns several large companies including Terminix. He told members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship that his first task would be to fix problems in the disaster loan program, which provides money to homeowners and businesses affected by natural disasters. Nearly a year after the hurricanes, the S.B.A. says that 99 percent of the loans have been processed, but the committee noted that only 20 percent of the money had been disbursed. ''This has got to be job No. 1,'' Mr. Preston said. ''We have to serve those in dire times of need.'' Mr. Preston would come to an agency in flux after its previous administrator, Hector V. Barreto, resigned in April. The agency budget has been reduced 37 percent since 1999, according to Congressional reports. The agency is short on staff and a survey taken last year found that its employees had the lowest morale of any federal agency. ''That's a concern to me,'' Mr. Preston said. ''It's tough for people to do their jobs when morale is low.'' Mr. Preston said he would tour the agency's 70 district offices and spend time with its more than 2,000 employees. The agency has also been criticized for supporting the elimination of popular initiatives like its microloan program, which provides up to $35,000 in loans and technical assistance to new and growing businesses. It is proposing to charge additional fees on loans of $1 million or more and expects to raise $7 million in revenue for administrative costs. Mr. Preston was questioned by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the committee, about ServiceMaster's lobbying efforts to end small-business set-asides for Defense Department landscaping contracts. ServiceMaster owns two of the nation's largest landscaping companies: TruGreen Chemlawn and TruGreen LandCare. ''What role did you have in ServiceMaster lobbying to put an end to the small business set-aside in landscaping?'' Mr. Kerry asked. Mr. Preston responded: ''It's not something that I was aware of and did not understand it until recently. I don't have the depth of understanding to know the impact to small businesses.'' Mr. Kerry then asked Mr. Preston if he would recuse himself from working on legislative matters that involve ServiceMaster. ''I would seek the advice of counsel on whether or not to recuse myself,'' Mr. Preston said. A vote to confirm him has not been scheduled, but with the S.B.A.'s disaster response plan for the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season due next month, it is expected that the committee will move quickly.

"On the Gulf Coast of Texas, Jim Hayes is building houses on concrete stilts that he says will shrug off winds of more than 130 miles an hour and will easily survive the worst hurricane flooding. Near Orlando, Fla., modest but striking cottages are being built with safe rooms and ballistic nylon storm shutters. In the Florida Panhandle, Jason Comer is putting up a village of gleaming white mansions with eight-inch concrete walls and heavy, ridged concrete roofs. After two years of horrendous hurricanes, with more catastrophic weather expected, a few dozen developers and contractors along the Southern coasts, from Texas to the Carolinas, have begun to produce a new generation of houses designed to withstand just about anything that nature can throw at them. ''We're building tanks,'' Mr. Comer said of his upscale development in the Florida Panhandle. Until now, few buyers have been interested in superstrong houses. Those houses have usually cost far more and often looked more like ugly ducklings than cozy havens. Nor did officials along the Southern coasts generally require builders to fortify their construction. Florida began toughening building codes after the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, but it has been the exception. Until recently, building requirements were minimal in Mississippi and Louisiana. But many of the new homes are proving more appealing. Demand has jumped sharply, and insurance companies are even offering policies at a discount in coastal areas where they are otherwise cutting back on coverage. ''People have seen what has happened in Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi and they know that what has happened can happen again,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, the vice president for research for the National Association of Home Builders. The new homes are several notches stronger than even the toughest building codes require. And many are being offered at surprisingly low prices. While the villas going up in the Florida Panhandle are selling for up to $5 million, Kristin Beall is offering her three-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot homes near Orlando for as little as $200,000. In Texas, Mr. Hayes is selling some of his stilt houses for $199,000, but his tiny studio model goes for as little as $99,000. He plans to build 140 of those houses and is clearing ground for 300 more equally strong houses that will start at $300,000. Sales have been brisk. Even without advertising, Ms. Beall is selling her houses faster than she can build them. Nearly 100 customers have signed up for her first 59 houses, she said. Mr. Hayes sold his first 14 houses in a month and has stopped taking orders while he gears up production. Insurance companies love the new houses. They are offering discounts of as much as 25 percent on premiums at the same time that they are sharply increasing prices for other homes. ''These homes are very attractive to insurers,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. Entire communities built to higher standards are even more appealing. ''One of the biggest causes of damage is flying debris,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''When an entire community is built to much higher standards, there is far less debris.'' Chuck Vance, a program manager at the Institute for Business and Home Safety in Tampa, said most of the reinforced houses were going up in Florida. They are also being built in Texas, the Carolinas and several other states. Mr. Vance's organization, financed by the insurance industry, advocates stronger building codes and certifies homes as fortified -- or built stronger than standard building codes. The institute would like to see stronger houses everywhere in the country. But so far, the greatest demand is in hurricane country. In focus groups conducted in Florida this year by a company promoting the use of stronger construction materials, potential home buyers ranked safety and durability much higher on their wish list than traditional dream features like granite countertops and cherry wood cabinets. ''They want durable roofs, storm shutters that are easy to put up and screened pool enclosures that can withstand high winds,'' said Ralph V. Roberts, a senior vice president of Worthington Industries in Columbus, Ohio, which sells steel bars and frames that can replace wooden materials in houses. Pictures of the wreckage in the town of Punta Gorda, on the gulf coast of Florida, came to symbolize the devastating consequences of Hurricane Charley in 2004. Since then, contractors for miles around say, home buyers have been clamoring for reinforcing features. Russell Garrod, an independent home builder in Punta Gorda and a former president of the local two-county building association, said about half of the nine houses he was building this year would have fortifying upgrades. On one $700,000 home, he said, he is putting in laminated high-impact windows and a heavily anchored sheet metal roof rather than one with shingles. He is also installing a solid concrete storm room. The extras, he said, will run about $35,000. Mr. Garrod said he also routinely advised putting in more concrete and steel reinforcing bars at a cost of about $300. These are inexpensive steps, he said, that can make a big difference in how well a home holds together in a storm. Mr. Garrod is building a solid concrete home for his family on elevated land at the water's edge in Punta Gorda. He expects it to be able to handle winds of 200 miles an hour. ''I always tell my customers, 'Here's what I would do for my personal house,' '' he said. ''You can spend a few bucks and I can upgrade, pour a little more concrete, add a little more steel, and you get a stronger house.'' Stronger houses, he said, are going to have higher resale value. ''When people drive by after a storm and don't see anything wrong with it,'' he said, ''I think that's a selling point.'' Ms. Beall, a third-generation home builder, worked with her mother to design her new line of houses. They adapted some of the gabled features of the Craftsman-style houses that were created in California in the early 1900's. The idea, she said, was to provide safe, attractive houses for working-class families. ''We wanted the design to be architecturally pleasing,'' she said. ''Not look like a fort, but be able to stand up to the weather.'' In Ms. Beall's houses, the walk-in closet doubles as an interior storm shelter. Its walls and ceiling are solid concrete laced with steel rods. The shutters, made of ballistic nylon, offer the same protection as steel shutters or laminated high-impact windows, but cost much less. They are also lightweight and easy to take down and store. Outside, there is space for a power generator, for when the electricity is out. Built-in wiring connects the generator to two power outlets in the storm room and four in the adjacent master bedroom. Seventy miles southeast of Houston, Mr. Hayes starts building his houses by drilling 10-foot shafts and filling them with concrete and reinforcing rods. Then he extends the 14-by-14-inch concrete columns 20 feet in the air and stabilizes them with a steel-reinforced foundation. The main living areas consist of rectangular boxes of superstrong laminated wood and interlocking plank floors. Mr. Hayes sets the boxes down about a foot on the concrete pilings and bolts them in place. In a practice that has become standard in South Florida, the roofs and walls are secured with metal straps. ''We're using basic materials,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''But we're doing things in such a manner -- the thickness, the heaviness, the frequency ofthe nailing, the blocking of 2 by 4's -- that it adds an additional rigidity.'' The ridged roofs of Mr. Comer's houses in the Florida Panhandle near Panama City tell the story of his building philosophy. They start with a base of three-quarter-inch plywood nailed to frames strapped to the walls. Then comes a thin sheet of rubberized, waterproof material. Next comes a coating of adhesive foam. Inch-thick concrete tiles are pressed into the adhesive, then screwed into the plywood. The tiles are then covered with a slurry of concrete that fills in all the joints and cracks. Finally, the roof, with foreshortened eaves, gets four coats of waterproof paint to further smooth and seal the surface. ''There's no opportunity for wind to get under the tiles,'' Mr. Comer said. For many people, the new houses provide a sense of security that no longer feels like a luxury. Melody Dimick and her husband, Barry, bought a perfectly nice retirement home three years ago when they moved to central Florida from Plattsburgh, N.Y. But after taking cover in their closet during Hurricane Charley and being brushed by two more of the four hurricanes that hit the state in 2004, they decided they needed a sturdier house. ''I just felt nervous,'' Ms. Dimick said. ''I sat here watching these huge windows I have in my house thinking, 'Oh, my God, I want smaller windows and I want them covered. I want a house that's prepared for the next time.' '' The Dimicks have started talking to Ms. Beall about buying one of her houses. And, Ms. Dimick said, they are pretty close to making a decision."
"Long Islanders who are not getting themselves and their families ready for a disaster -- and we mean really getting ready, not just pinning a phone number to the fridge -- are running out of excuses. A huge sand dune of complacency has piled up since the last killer storm hit. Hardly any of us remember the Long Island Express of 1938, which tore open the Shinnecock Inlet and killed more than 50 people. But we can all recall the storms that slashed across southern Florida and the Gulf of Mexico last year. Now a new hurricane season has begun, and Long Island is rolling the dice one more time. How ready are we? State Senator Michael Balboni, a Nassau Republican who is chairman of the Senate's homeland security committee, issued a report last year that gave Nassau and Suffolk dismal grades for disaster readiness. It said the county governments needed to drastically improve their emergency communications systems, evacuation plans and network of shelters. Suffolk Executive Steve Levy, for one, was greatly annoyed by Mr. Balboni's conclusions, which he called hastily drawn and in many cases flat-out wrong. He said the county had tackled disaster-planning with systematic vigor and that county residents -- particularly the weak, sick and old -- would be sheltered and safe. We won't know for sure how good any preparations were until after a disaster. But let's assume that Mr. Levy and his Nassau counterpart, Tom Suozzi, are on the job. We still worry about the Red Cross, whose inadequacies as an overburdened volunteer organization were painfully exposed by Katrina. We have no idea whether the federal government will manage future emergencies any better than it did on the Gulf Coast. And we are only too aware that long-range planning remains inadequate. We were dismayed last month, for example, when the City of Long Beach rejected a plan from the Army Corps of Engineers to build a dune along its boardwalk that could have kept that low-lying, densely populated community from being submerged in a bad storm. Because there is much we cannot know, Long Islanders should assume greater responsibility for their own safety. They should expect that communications will break down and roads and bridges will be impassable. They should remember that the sensible thing to do when the Big One hits may simply be to stay put, hole up and help one another. This means thinking ahead and laying in supplies. But that message has not entirely sunk in. A study last month by New York University and the Red Cross showed that most people in New York City would not even have enough food or water to last three days in an emergency. Even more astonishing, most people said they would seek safety by driving or hailing a cab. Federal and local governments and the Red Cross could do everyone a favor if they would coordinate a simple message on what vital supplies should be stocked. They include a radio, flashlight, extra batteries, a first-aid kit, food and water for at least three days and -- don't forget -- a can opener. The Nassau and Suffolk Web sites (www.nassaucountyny.gov and www.co.suffolk.ny.us) explain the essentials, although the information takes more than a few clicks to uncover. Both 9/11 and the blackout of August 2003 each demonstrated how resilient and generously helpful we can be. Still, the potential for a sustained disaster, like a hurricane or a flu outbreak, could pose new tests, and that is where comfort and even survival will depend on making basic preparations. Long Island"
"It has been almost 10 months since Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf Coast, and there is still no redevelopment plan for New Orleans. Congress has passed the emergency relief bill, and President Bush has signed it into law. Billions of dollars are headed the city's way. Leaders in New Orleans and in the state capital of Baton Rouge will have only one chance to get it right. There are no more excuses for local officials, no more pointing toward Washington. It is time for southeastern Louisiana to rebuild itself. Yet Adam Nossiter reported this week in The Times that it will be six months before a ''master planning document'' answers the questions foremost in the minds of residents, like which neighborhoods will return, where rebuilding will be encouraged and where returning residents will have to make do without city services. That is totally unacceptable. In large swaths of the city, houses still sit empty, block after block. In many places, trash and flood-ruined automobiles have yet to be cleared away. These wastelands provide hideouts for criminals, the perfect breeding ground for the kind of violence that erupted over the weekend when five teenagers were shot and killed. If the city's open wounds are left to fester, it will begin to rot from the inside. The city's police department is close to its prehurricane size, protecting a population that is less than half of what it was before the storm. Yet Mayor Ray Nagin has now felt compelled to request -- and the governor has granted -- a National Guard force to help keep the peace. This does not bolster our confidence that the city will be able to govern itself. New Orleans has its own way of doing things and says it doesn't want to be told by outsiders in what size and shape it should be reborn. That is fair enough, but only if local officials are living up to their responsibilities. Right now, the people of the city are being held hostage to whims and foot-dragging, their lives on hold as they wait for their leaders to make decisions -- decisions that should have been made months ago. If there is one individual who needs to step up more than any other, it is Mayor Nagin. His city needs a leader more than a politician in this difficult time. Now that Mr. Nagin has been re-elected, it is time to start spending the political capital his victory earned him. His legacy will not rest on how many people like him, but on the effectiveness of the reconstruction and the safety and well-being of residents in the years to come. New Orleans needs its mayor to speak difficult truths -- like telling the residents of a vulnerable block that they will have to rebuild on safer ground. Right now, people don't know if or where to build their new walls. They deserve answers. They have waited long enough. Editorial"
"All trees and farmland, the tribal chief said. With hard acres of green where cattle grazed, adults trapped game, and boys and girls of the Biloxi-Chitimacha tribe ran without even dampening their feet. You should have seen it. But you can hardly imagine it, much less see it, because where gardens sprouted and children sprinted just 30 years ago, there is now a grass skirt of mushy marshland, and beyond, the rippling open waters that lead to the Gulf of Mexico. ''Water,'' the tribe's conflicted chief, Albert Naquin, said. ''All water.'' Think of a ship with expansive decks and a close-knit crew. Now think of that ship surrendering slowly to the ocean, leaving its crew clinging to an ever-sinking bow. The ship is this island, here at the bayou bottom of Louisiana, about 30 miles south of U.S. Highway 90. And its crew members are the island's inhabitants, the small band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha, related to the Choctaws and part of a larger confederation of Muskogees. For natural and manufactured reasons, 30 square miles of South Louisiana wetlands vanish every year into the Gulf. People here say they lose a football field every 20 minutes, every half-hour, every hour -- the estimates vary, but the panic is constant, partly because wetlands and barrier islands act as hurricane buffers for the vulnerable mainland. The unnerving sense of ''look away, lose an inch'' is especially keen here on the very poor, very mucky and thoroughly exposed Isle de Jean Charles, which almost dutifully received six feet of water during Hurricane Rita last September. But the advancing waters rubbing away a culture have a partner, tribal members say: the government. To reach the island, you take a narrow road that was raised several years ago but which has sunk so much since that cars seem to skim the lapping waters. As you drive, you leave behind the initial stage of a 72-mile levee system called the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection Project. The operative word here: behind. This $887 million project of the Army Corps of Engineers, long-planned and still awaiting full Congressional authorization, is designed to stem the wetlands' erosion in Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes caused by natural subsidence, the rerouting of the Mississippi River and, some say, global warming. ''The system will provide hurricane protection to over 90 percent of the residents,'' said Jerome Zeringue, the director of the Terrebonne Levee and Conservation District. ''There are a few people left out, unfortunately.'' Most of those few left out are the Biloxi-Chitimacha on Isle de Jean Charles. ''We did originally try to put them in there,'' Mr. Zeringue said. ''The problem is, based on the cost-benefit ratio, it would cost too much to include that sliver of land. For the cost, you could buy the island and all the residents tenfold.'' In effect, the government had to ask itself: is it worth $100 million or more to protect a shrinking spit of an island, its only road, its modest homes, some of them little more than shacks, and its 250 residents, whose families have lived here for generations? Its conclusion: no. ''Even in a high tide, with strong southeast winds, these people have water in their yards,'' Mr. Zeringue said. He emphasized that the decision was not made lightly. A few years ago, the island's residents rejected a proposal to be relocated somewhere within the Morganza skirt. Since then, water and mortality have continued to creep, leaving some of the younger members to question the point of it all. Not that many of them trust the government. Residents float conspiracies about greedy land speculators and oil interests craving the liquid gold that may lie beneath. Their distrust runs deep in the softening soil; they don't have to think too far back to remember a time when they could neither pray nor learn beside white people. Mr. Naquin, the tribal chief, solid as a piling, rode down that only island road, where the local surnames of Naquin, Billiot and Dardar date to the mid-1800's; where patchwork wooden walkways twist over an ever-widening bayou; and where some abandoned houses look as if they had exploded. Do not immediately blame last year's Hurricane Rita for the damage; it might have been Hurricane Lili, in 2002, or Tropical Storm Bill, in 2003. But each storm accelerates the inevitable fate. Several children frolicked in the bayou muck outside a small house, while their grandfather, Philip Brunet, watched in the melting heat. At 61, he has ''caught'' two heart attacks, as he put it, ending his career as a welder and signaling that the time had come to leave where he has lived all his life. ''We're moving, me and my wife,'' Mr. Brunet told his old friend, the chief. ''We're going to take off when the hurricanes come and go someplace high. No more mud to clean.'' The chief said goodbye -- ''I love y'all,'' Mr. Brunet called after him, in affecting Cajun English -- and moved down the road. He passed the old cemetery, spongy and unused since the 1940's; the mounds of empty Milwaukee's Best beer cans that glitter outside a tilting shack; and the sinking property of his older sister, Denecia Billiot, and her husband, Wenceslaus. The Billiots raised seven children, all of whom have moved off the island. Now they live alone in a house placed on stilts after Lili. When they look out their back window, they see deep blue water where corn grew and their children played. They sit on the porch, Mr. Billiot wearing a red Army cap that hints of his South Pacific tour during World War II, Mrs. Billiot killing sand flies with a pink swatter. ''I'm not going nowhere,'' she said. ''I was born here. I got 81 already.'' Years on the island, that is. The chief passed other houses, naming residents both here and gone: shrimpers and welders and riggers and loafers. He pointed out where Lover's Lane used to be, where a dance hall used to beckon, where groves of trees used to flourish before the salt water withered them dry. Even the chief doesn't live on Isle de Jean Charles anymore. The only road leading to the island kept flooding, he said, and he could not afford to lose his off-island job in the petroleum industry. He moved 30 years ago from an island house that still stands, an empty hull, vacant since Hurricane Lili. He came to the end of the island road, to the spot where he and his many siblings grew up, including Gustave, who died in a tugboat accident; Simon, who died in the Vietnam War; and Deme, the tribal chief before him, and now an elder. Mr. Naquin is nearly 60, and his tribal burdens line his face. He fears that if he sues the federal government for leaving the island outside the levees, he will jeopardize his tribe's application for federal recognition. He fears that if he does nothing, his tribe may not survive the next colossal hurricane. Even his preferred option -- the government builds homes on the mainland for tribal members, but allows members to move off the island when they feel ready -- could mean the loss of connection to the land, the loss of cultural ways, the loss of continuity. ''It is terrible for me,'' the chief of the Biloxi-Chitimacha said, as another sun set on the encroaching waters. ''I thought I could change the world, but the world is changing me.'' This is the fourth in a series of articles that head west from Alabama along U.S. 90, through the towns, counties and parishes still struggling to recover from last year's destructive hurricanes.

"Within the Police Department here, the SWAT team is known as The Final Option. Before Hurricane Katrina, it was assigned to the city's worst crimes, and as residents return, it is once again kicking in the doors at the worst drug dens and engaging in shootouts with violent offenders. But the team is also running dangerously low on firepower. Flooding ruined 300 of its guns, its bullet-resistant shields and the bulk of its ammunition, none of which have been replaced more than nine months after the hurricane. The 40-man team has had to borrow body armor from suburban forces, and the Police Department is lining up corporate sponsors to contribute more. ''I tell you what: we're hurting,'' said the team's commander, Capt. Jeffrey Winn. The SWAT unit's difficulties reflect how far from normal many police operations remain here, as residents return and another hurricane season begins. Like the rest of the city, the police force is still struggling to recover from the calamity of Hurricane Katrina, which knocked out its headquarters, overwhelmed its ability to maintain control and prompted desertions that tarnished the force's reputation. Now, as the department tries to fight its way back, sharp budget cuts -- and a recent spike in drug-related killings in the city -- are adding to fears that years of overhauls and modernization may be undone, and that New Orleans could return to its former notoriety as one of the nation's murder capitals. There is also concern that the department's own notoriety could resurface. For some residents, the sense that the city is on edge and the department's future uncertain has brought echoes of the days when the local police were considered among the least competent and most racist and brutal in the nation. ''Given where they are mentally and emotionally, we've gotten more citizen complaints about the way the police are treating people than we have in a long time,'' said Oliver M. Thomas Jr., the City Council president. ''Over the last two years, they'd been getting better and more professional. But I've been hearing lots of complaints about verbal abuse.'' The blunt-talking new police superintendent, Warren J. Riley, insists he will not let the drug dealers and ''gutter punks'' take over again. Mr. Riley says many officers have not gotten the credit they deserve for ''standing tall'' during the storm, and he is determined to restore discipline and a sense of professionalism among the others. He has also formed an intelligence unit to track the most ruthless crime suspects and built strong ties with federal authorities to help catch them. But in other areas, problems abound. More than 200 officers deserted during the storm and were fired or suspended. Many veteran officers retired, and some of the youngest officers quit and left town. As a result, the size of the force has dropped to about 1,400 officers on the street now, from nearly 1,700 before the hurricane. Recruiting replacements is difficult, partly because it is hard for candidates to find affordable housing, Mr. Riley said. Because of the deterioration of the city's finances, he said, the department's budget has been slashed by 19 percent, from $124 million in 2005 to $100 million this year. It has received federal or state aid to replace many of the 300 patrol cars lost to flooding, buy new uniforms and restore its communications system. But it is awaiting federal assistance to replace other gear, like the SWAT team's weapons. With the police headquarters still shuttered, Mr. Riley and his top commanders are working out of trailers. And while forensic experts are making progress in restoring many of the items from the flooded police evidence room, newly gathered evidence is being stored in rental trucks parked at what was once a motor-vehicle inspection station. The storm has also left a lingering emotional toll. More than 80 percent of the officers lost their homes, and some have had to double up with other officers or move to distant suburbs to find housing they can afford on their salaries of $35,000 to $50,000. Many who were heroes in the storm, plucking victims out of the floodwaters, are also resentful that their actions were overshadowed by those who abandoned their posts. And with many residents here under stress, the police say they are also receiving more back talk from people stopped for even minor violations. ''Since the storm, you have a lot of displaced anger among many people, and it seems that police officers always get the brunt of that displaced anger,'' said Capt. Kevin B. Anderson, the police commander in the French Quarter. But in the end, nearly everyone here realizes that what defines the Police Department is how well it handles crime, particularly in terms of the murder rate. Before the storm, the city averaged 250 to 300 murders a year, always placing it at, or near, the top spot in the nation on a per-capita basis. So far this year, there have been 45 murders -- most of them in the last two months -- compared with 114 at this time in 2005, when the city's population was at least twice what it is now. Superintendent Riley -- who was promoted from the department's No. 2 job after his more flamboyant predecessor, Edwin P. Compass III, resigned after criticism over the police response to the hurricane -- appeared on radio talk shows recently to outline his crime-fighting plans. They include repeated raids in the poorer neighborhoods that have been resettled, where he said drug dealers who had lived in different parts of the city were converging and killing one another over turf. The superintendent also urged residents to band together to demand a toughening of the city's criminal justice system, where jury trials resumed only recently. Drug dealers who evacuated to Houston are returning home because it is much easier here to avoid jail, Mr. Riley said, through the ''revolving door'' of the New Orleans court system. The courts have long been criticized as relying on plea bargains and setting lenient bail. And since the hurricane, the public defender system has been so short of money and staffing that one judge, Arthur L. Hunter Jr., recently moved to let some people already in custody back onto the streets. Mr. Riley said, for instance, that police officers were in a shootout last month with one man who had been roaming a deserted neighborhood while wearing an ankle bracelet. He was supposed to be under house arrest while awaiting trial on a burglary charge, but the authorities had apparently not responded to the bracelet monitoring system. ''Obviously, the murder risk factors are coming back,'' said Peter Scharf, a criminologist at the University of New Orleans, ''and this creates incredible challenges.'' Whether a growing nervousness about the murder rate gives way again to a feeling of being under siege could end up determining if many people return home and tourists start coming back. Captain Anderson, the French Quarter commander, said there had been only two murders there this year, along with several stabbings among construction workers carousing on Bourbon Street. He also said the SWAT team had been called in for undercover patrols after groups of youths had accosted people. James F. Scott, the deputy police superintendent, said the department's intelligence bureau had focused on 112 drug dealers and murder suspects, and 30 had since been captured. Mr. Scott said some drug dealers who evacuated to Houston were killed in turf wars with gangs there, while others were now moving back and forth between the two cities, almost like commuters. He added that federal prosecutors here were now bringing charges in smaller drug-sale and gun-possession cases to help get criminals off the street. ''Since the storm, that is one of the most positive things that has happened to the Police Department,'' Mr. Scott said. The department has also worked with the Louisiana National Guard to avoid a repeat of last year's disastrous storm response. Superintendent Riley said 3,000 troops could be in the city ahead of a storm, with high-water trucks and satellite communications gear positioned to assist each police district. There will also be more boats on hand for search-and-rescue operations. Barring another disaster, Mr. Riley said, ''Katrina has given us an opportunity to refocus our educational system, our economic system and our law-enforcement efforts, and change the culture of this city.'' ''If we're able to change it,'' he said, ''that would give us a silver lining.''"
"After the twin barrages of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year, the City of New Orleans emerged nearly 64 percent smaller, having lost an estimated 278,833 residents, according to the Census Bureau's first study of the area since the storms. Those who remained in the city were significantly more likely to be white, slightly older and a bit more well-off, the bureau concluded in two reports that were its first effort to measure the social, financial and demographic impact of the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast. The bureau found that while New Orleans lost about two-thirds of its population, adjacent St. Bernard Parish dropped a full 95 percent, falling to just 3,361 residents by Jan. 1. The surveys do not include the influx in both areas that has occurred this year as more residents begin to rebuild. While the New Orleans area lost population, the Houston metropolitan area emerged with more than 130,000 new residents, many of them hurricane evacuees. Whites made up a slightly smaller percentage of Houston's population -- 62.8 percent of the city in January compared with 64.8 percent last July, a month before Hurricane Katrina hit. In Harris County, which includes Houston, median household income fell to $43,044 from $44,517, while New Orleans area's actually rose, to $43,447 from $39,793. The physical impact of the hurricanes is well documented. Now, with these reports, bureau officials said they hoped to begin drawing into sharper focus the human landscape, showing in stark statistics how the storm's impact was felt most keenly by the poor, members of minorities and renters. ''One of the keys for me is that the data we are seeing really supports the anecdotal stories we've been hearing for months,'' said Lisa Blumerman, deputy chief of the bureau's American Community Survey. ''We now have quantitative data that supports the stories from the storm.'' One of the reports looked solely at population gains and losses, while the second studied demographic shifts before and after the storm. The reports' findings had been expected, said William H. Frey, a demographer for the Brookings Institution. Still, he said, there were some small surprises. It was not only New Orleans but also the entire metropolitan region that became whiter, less poor and more mobile, Mr. Frey said. At the same time, he said, assumptions that the evacuees who went to nearby Baton Rouge, where the population grew by nearly 15,000, were disproportionately poor and black were proven incorrect. A more middle-class group settled there, while the poorer and more vulnerable, who had less choice about where they landed, went to more distant cities. Demographers in the affected states said yesterday that they were skeptical of some of the methodology in the studies, wary of the results and unsure how helpful the reports would be in measuring the human impact of the storms. Steve Murdock, the state demographer of Texas, said the studies underestimated the number of hurricane evacuees in Houston by limiting their measurements to individual households and failing to count people living in hotels, shelters and other group environments. ''I can tell you that I learned nothing new about Texas,'' Mr. Murdock said. ''These are very limited data. The truth is, nobody knows how good this data really is.'' Caroline Leung, an economic researcher at Louisiana Tech University, said she had been trying to reconcile some conflicting data in the two reports and came away confused. The underlying trends may be valid, Ms. Leung said, ''but I would not rely too much on those population numbers.'' Census officials emphasized that the special reports used a somewhat different methodology than typical bureau studies, saying some of the numbers might be slightly less concrete than normal. ''But we felt the need to do this quickly, because the impact of the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast population is really without precedent,'' said Enrique Lamas, chief of the bureau's population division. Of the 117 counties and parishes used in the studies -- those identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as eligible for disaster assistance -- only 40 lost population in the four months after the storm, and 99 percent of the losses came in the top 10 parishes and counties, comprising New Orleans and Lake Charles in Louisiana and Gulfport and Biloxi in Mississippi. The black population of the New Orleans metropolitan area fell to 21 percent from 36 percent, the bureau found."
"Tropical Storm Alberto weakened Tuesday before hitting the Florida Gulf Coast with heavy rain and high winds, but it did not pose the threat that forecasters had initially feared. The storm made landfall early Tuesday afternoon near Adams Beach, about 50 miles southeast of Tallahassee, with winds of 50 miles per hour, well below the 70 m.p.h. winds it carried Monday that caused forecasters to fear that it would strengthen into a hurricane. ''It lost its chance to become a hurricane because it ran out of time,'' said Jack Beven at the National Hurricane Center. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Atlantic Coast from South Santee River in South Carolina southward to north of Altamaha Sound in Georgia. The storm was expected to continue moving inland and weaken further, reaching the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina-Virginia border as a tropical depression on Thursday. The storm brought down tree limbs and caused flooding along parts of the coast, but no serious injuries were reported. More than six inches of rain fell during the storm in some areas, and more than 11,000 households and businesses were without power, and more than 4,000 were without phone service Tuesday afternoon, state officials said. ''I think we are on top of this, and this is a good lesson, I think, in preparedness,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said in Tallahassee. ''I can assure you that if a stronger storm comes our way, we have a great team locally and at the state level.'' In Sunset Beach, just north of St. Pete Beach, Rob Porter and his daughters, Priscilla, 9, and Mattie, 11, surfed and body boarded in the large waves just after the storm made landfall. ''This is everything we love,'' Mr. Porter said. ''On the Gulf Coast we hardly ever get days for this.''"
"Nearly 40 years ago, Robin Knox-Johnston of Britain became the first person to sail solo around the world nonstop, but recently he was drifting along in the desolate Indian Ocean, alone in his 60-foot sailing yacht while his supplies of food, fuel and strength ran low. Somehow, after more than 67 days at sea in the Velux 5 Oceans single-handed around-the-world race, the 67-year-old Knox-Johnston emerged as the surprise third-place finisher Wednesday when he completed the first leg in Fremantle, Australia. Only five of the seven starters in the 30,150-nautical-mile competition are still in the race. The first- and second-place boats finished nearly a month ago. Two of the top competitors, who were ahead of Knox-Johnston, dropped out of the race after one boat was abandoned last month and another dismasted. Two competitors were left fighting gale-force winds en route to the end of the first leg, which began in Bilbao, Spain, on Oct. 22. The race is expected to finish there in April. Companies are paying millions of dollars to sponsor the event and the competitors, hoping for a return on the international exposure that comes with the race. The boats, which are identified by their corporate sponsors, carry the companies' logos. But the Velux 5 Oceans race has been so treacherous that some sponsors are now associated with abandoned boats and sailors fighting for their lives. ''It's a very risky proposition,'' said Matthew Lalin, executive vice president for Steiner Sports Marketing in New Rochelle, N.Y. Lalin said the dangerous nature of the competition might not deter sponsors who are more interested in the potential news media coverage than any return on investment. But he cautioned that those priorities could change if a representative was injured or killed. For the first time in 20 years, a sailor died during the Volvo Ocean Race in June. The Dutch bank ABN Amro, which sponsored the winning boat and the one that lost the sailor overboard, announced this fall that it would not have an entry in the next race. Despite the dwindling fleet, gear failures and storms that have added weeks to the first leg of the Velux 5 Oceans race, event sponsors said they were receiving a positive return on their investment. ''This is not a race where everyone will finish,'' Michael Rasmussen, the chief marketing officer of the Velux Group, the lead sponsor of the event, said in a telephone interview from Denmark this week. ''We asked ourselves, 'What if nobody finished?' There is that risk. But this is something we had expected. This is really the ultimate solo challenge.'' Velux, a manufacturer of skylights that is based in Denmark, forged a partnership with the solo ocean race after searching for a sporting event that could garner global exposure and fit with its core values. Rasmussen said his company initially had concerns about the extreme nature of the event, but he said he believed that Clipper Ventures, the company that operates the race, ''has a crisis operation that makes this as safe as it could be.'' In the 25-year history of the event, two sailors have died. The first leg of the Velux race has been more dramatic than Rasmussen and even the most seasoned sailors had expected. Only days after the start in Bilbao in October, hurricane-strength winds forced more than half the fleet to seek cover and repair damaged boats and sails. Further into the race, in the wind-whipped Southern Ocean, the second- and third-place boats were forced from the race by the conditions. Mike Golding and Alex Thomson of Britain pulled out in November when Thomson abandoned his vessel -- adorned with the Hugo Boss logo -- after the ballast keel broke. Golding completed a daring rescue before his carbon-fiber mast buckled, forcing the men to seek refuge in Cape Town. ''It's a yacht race, but it's a battle with nature and yourself to survive this race,'' said David Adams, the race's organizer, in a telephone interview from Australia. ''Now we've got the slower guys that have one-third the budgets still doing the mental battle every day. This human endeavor is magnified when it's just one person.'' Some sailors, like Golding, have fixed sponsorships, meaning the sponsor pays the yachtsman a set amount and is not responsible for any additional expenses. In a telephone interview from Australia, Golding said his eight-year contract with Ecover, an environmental cleaning product company, had an annual budget of about $2 million. ''The breakage of my mast only affects publicity; it doesn't cost them more,'' said Golding, who chose to drop out of the race rather than have the mast repaired. ''It has more effect on my business. It's all about budgeting and forecasting.'' Golding said sponsors who pay for everything might be disgruntled when problems arise. If a mast breaks on every leg of the race, the sponsor must keep writing the checks, he said. The mishaps of the first leg of the Velux competition have helped give the race leader, Bernard Stamm of Switzerland, a comfortable lead of two days over Kojiro Shiraishi of Japan. The problems have also made Stamm, who reached Fremantle on Dec. 4, more cautious. The next leg, to Norfolk, Va., is even longer than the last, at about 14,000 nautical miles. ''You can't only sail safe,'' Stamm said in a telephone interview from Australia. ''Otherwise you'll be left behind. I have to find a balance between racing and safety.'' SAILING"
"The cost of breakfast is going up courtesy of four hurricanes and a tenacious citrus disease. The average price of a gallon of orange juice is 14 percent higher this year, according to statistics compiled by ACNielsen, the market research firm. Prices averaged $5.09 a gallon at the end of October compared with $4.45 a year earlier. Tropicana, a division of PepsiCo and the nation's largest producer of orange juice, and Minute Maid, part of the Coca-Cola Company, say consumers should see more price increases or fewer discounts in coming months because of what is expected to be a lackluster crop. Prices for orange juice had been relatively flat for a number of years. The current crop of oranges is estimated to be the smallest in 17 years, 135 million boxes compared with a harvest in excess of 200 million boxes before a string of hurricanes hit in 2004 and 2005. A box represents 90 pounds of oranges. Florida produces about 80 percent of the orange juice consumed in the United States. Andrew Meadows, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Citrus, said the orange crop for 2006 and 2007 was anticipated to be the smallest since a series of freezes in the 1980s -- the last of them in December 1989 -- devastated Florida's orange industry. This time, the orange shortfall results from a series of events that began in 2004, when three hurricanes -- Charley, Frances and Jeanne -- hit the citrus-growing regions of Florida. Last year, Hurricane Wilma did more damage to the areas. Mr. Meadows said the hurricanes crisscrossed the state in such a way that nearly every acre with citrus groves was affected in some way. In the worst case, trees were uprooted, while in other instances nearly ripened fruit was blown off trees or trees were damaged, he said. The shortage of fruit has been made worse by lingering problems from citrus canker disease, which started in Dade County in 1995 and has spread through the state, in part on the winds of the hurricanes. As a result, an estimated 10 percent of the state's orange groves have been burned in an effort to impede the disease, Mr. Meadows said. Last year's crop was 148 million boxes, and the 2004 season's crop was 150 million boxes, compared with 242 million boxes in 2003. In the past, the Florida citrus industry has responded to bad crops by planting new trees, but it appears it will be difficult to do so on a large scale this time around. Many of Florida's nurseries were damaged by citrus canker disease, and land values are so high in the state that it is hard to justify planting new orange groves, according to Thomas H. Spreen, professor and chairman of the food and resource economics department at the University of Florida. ''Twenty years ago, people would have been planting trees like crazy,'' he said. ''We don't think the industry is going to suddenly collapse, but we don't think it's going to recover like it did after the freezes in the 80s.'' The smaller crops have nonetheless been a boon to growers whose trees have continued to produce fruit. Prices for a box of oranges are hovering around $10, compared with $3 a box during the bumper crops before the hurricanes, Professor Spreen said. ''I own 60 acres myself, and we are going to make a bunch of money this year, and I don't even have a very good crop,'' he said. But the orange shortage has created headaches for manufacturers. The chief executive of PepsiCo, Indra K. Nooyi, said in October that the biggest factor holding down third-quarter profits was the cost of orange juice. The orange industry's problems follow those of the grapefruit industry. The grapefruit crop, which was down substantially last year because of hurricane damage, is recovering somewhat this year. Where last year's crop was 19 million boxes, this year's should be in the range of 26 million boxes, Mr. Meadows said. But last fall, with the grapefruit crop down substantially, consumer demand for grapefruit juice plummeted by as much as 30 percent after prices increased 20 percent and more. ''We went from being afraid we were going to run out of grapefruit juice to having a year's supply,'' said Richard A. Fort Jr., president of the Peace River Packing Company in Fort Meade, Fla. ''People found an alternative product.'' But Mr. Fort said he thought that demand for orange juice would not dip as drastically because it was a much larger market, approximately six times the size, and consumer demand was much less volatile. Sales of orange juice are down 10 percent over last year. ''There is always concern when any product goes up dramatically like orange juice has done,'' Mr. Fort said. At the Wilmette Food Mart in the north suburbs of Chicago, the owner, Milay Shah, said wholesale prices had jumped so much that he had little choice but to pass along the costs to consumers. As a result, sales have tanked, he said. ''In any week here, I'd sell three dozen of those 64-ounce bottles,'' Mr. Shah said. ''But now, lucky to sell six or seven. Total.'' But at a nearby Jewel grocery store, a shopper, Bruce Scivally, 44, said he had not changed his occasional orange juice habit. ''Even with the prices going up, it's generally so incremental that I would still stick with orange juice rather than switch,'' he said. ''I've been drinking it for years, and in the cold weather, with a sore throat coming on, there aren't many better choices.''"
"AT this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America, which took place in Philadelphia in October, representatives of the United States Army Corps of Engineers presented proposals to re-engineer the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Some 200 coastal and marine scientists attended the meeting; most of them were stunned by the scope, expense and sheer wastefulness of the projects the corps is considering. The corps' proposals include a large seawall to protect parts of Bay St. Louis on the coast along with storm surge gates, similar to those that the British use on the Thames, to close off local bays. One particularly awe-inspiring proposal calls for reconfiguring the Mississippi Gulf Islands to approximate their circa 1969, pre-Hurricane Camille length and width, while adding sufficient sand to the islands to achieve elevations of roughly 20 feet. These barrier islands are part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and include designated wilderness areas. The proposed project would dump an estimated 50 million cubic yards of sand on the national seashore solely to protect redevelopment of the mainland coast. At the very least, these proposals would cost billions of dollars to realize, aside from the environmental damage that would ensue. Yet as the corps acknowledged at the Geological Society meeting, its proposed ''coastal improvements'' would not provide protection from the kind of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes that have destroyed coastal Mississippi twice in the past 37 years. So what, exactly, is the point? The corps' failure to devise a rational redevelopment plan points to the futility of trying to maintain coastal development in such an unstable place. A realistic appraisal would conclude that the long-term outlook for coastal development there is bleak. Yet the corps, urged on by developers, seems determined to wage a quixotic fight. This is particularly galling in light of a recent report issued by the British government under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern, who is widely viewed as a pragmatist. The Stern report concluded that it will probably cost global economies more to ignore climate change than to take steps to address it. It seems we are about to learn this lesson in coastal Mississippi. Rather than use a creative, flexible approach to redevelopment on a vulnerable, changing coast, the corps is commanding nature to behave itself. The clear consensus among coastal scientists at the Geological Society meeting was that the corps' ambitious plans for Mississippi will fail -- either all at once in a major hurricane or gradually through shoreline erosion and other long-term changes. It is an effort in futility. Pragmatism, fiscal and otherwise, dictates that we cannot afford to continue the cycle of development and destruction. The vulnerability of our nation's shores will only increase over the next decades as global climate change leads to rising sea levels, increased coastal erosion and stronger hurricanes of greater duration. The time has come to step back from this extraordinarily hazardous shoreline, perhaps to replace the blocks of destroyed buildings with rows of protective dunes in a seashore park. We should not rebuild on the shoreline of vulnerable areas like the Mississippi Gulf Coast. We certainly shouldn't be doing it with federal dollars or destroying a National Seashore in order to provide a false sense of security for redevelopment. If the corps follows through on its proposals, the United States will once again miss an opportunity to respond sensibly to the threat of global warming. Op-Ed Contributors Robert S. Young is the director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. Orrin H. Pilkey is a professor of earth sciences at Duke."
"Ambitious federal plans to repair the Gulf Coast and defend it against future hurricanes are coming under fire from many coastal scientists who say they would only perpetuate a costly and wrongheaded approach to storm management. The projects are still in the planning stages by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been ordered by Congress to present its long-term, comprehensive plans by the end of 2007. In addition to short-term repair projects, the corps is considering large and elaborate systems of walls and barriers, offshore breakwaters, dune reconstruction on offshore barrier islands, levees and mechanical barriers or gates that would close across inlets to keep surging storm waters out. Many scientists have long objected to seawalls, other coastal armor and even some beach restoration projects as costly interventions that can damage the very beaches they are supposed to protect. But they say the larger projects will have the same effects, only worse. ''The most shocking thing to me is that they would even consider some of the things that they are considering,'' said Robert J. Young, new director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines, a project of Duke and Western Carolina universities. At a special session about the corps's proposals at a meeting of the Geological Society of America in October, Dr. Young said his fellow scientists ''were just stunned.'' Dr. Young, who helped organize the session, added, ''I saw mouths dropping open at the scale of proposed coastal engineering.'' David B. Shaver, chief of the geological resources division of the National Park Service, said the session was important in making sure that ''the professional geological community was aware of what was going on.'' He is concerned with the proposals because they affect islands in the Gulf Islands National Seashore. The corps says it is working closely with state agencies, federal emergency management officials and environmental regulators, ''trying to come up with a plan that would retain the quality of life'' but also keep residents ''as far out of harm's way as possible,'' in the words of Susan Ivester Rees, a marine scientist with its Mobile district in Alabama, where much of the work is coordinated. ''We are putting a balanced emphasis on everything in as great detail as we can,'' she said. While there are ''a lot of innovative engineering solutions,'' she continued, the corps will look at relocation and other approaches ''beyond your typical asphalt on the ground.'' The scientists and the corps agree on one point: Hurricane Katrina ''changed Mississippi's Gulf Coast forever,'' as the corps said in its outline of its proposals, ''Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program, Interim Report'' (http://mscip.usace.army.mil/downloads.asp). As the report puts it, ''beachfront neighborhoods were leveled entirely, and estimates by officials have calculated that 90 percent of the structures within one-half mile of the coastline were completely destroyed.'' But Dr. Young said the corps's approach was ''designed to let those folks put most of that infrastructure back in place.'' ''We have already seen those communities wiped out twice in 37 years,'' he went on, referring to Hurricane Camille, in 1969, and Hurricane Katrina. ''And it's not just that the coast of Mississippi is going to have the same vulnerability; the vulnerability is only going to increase because of sea level rise,'' which most climate experts agree is accelerating because of global warming. The proposal that seems to have aroused the most shock and amazement among the geologists would be the most seaward line of defense: a proposal to rebuild offshore barrier islands to their size and shape before Camille, an epic undertaking that would require almost unimaginable amounts of sand, to say nothing of money. ''We are in the billions, easily,'' said Rebecca Beavers, coastal geology coordinator for the Park Service and another organizer of the G.S.A. session. When the geologists at the meeting heard about this plan, ''some people were quite dismayed,'' she said. ''Some people were almost incensed.'' Even Dr. Rees of the corps agrees that it is far from certain that any island-building project would be worth its economic and environmental cost. ''What we're looking at is restoring the footprint,'' she said, and building dunes perhaps 20 feet high on the islands. But one of them, Ship Island, was cut in two by Camille, and the separation has grown since then. Also, Dr. Rees said, a 20-foot dune, ''which is what was there prior to Camille, probably doesn't give you protection from a Katrina, because the surge at Katrina was higher than that.'' The corps estimates that the storm surge at Ship Island was at least 35 feet. ''I cannot even imagine it,'' she said. In any case, Dr. Beavers said, under the Park Service mandate to maintain its islands in their natural state, restoration efforts are typically undertaken only to mitigate damage by people. Dr. Rees said, ''Obviously, this is going to take a lot of discussion.'' A similar issue has also arisen, on a much smaller scale, elsewhere in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, on Santa Rosa Island, near Pensacola, Fla. There the issue is whether to rebuild a road that storms have washed out four times since 2004. The federal government is prepared to rebuild the road, but only if something is done to prevent it from washing out again. Engineers have proposed installing metal sheet piling and other armor. But more than a dozen coastal scientists from around the country have objected. In a letter to the Park Service, they say armoring the road will interfere with natural sand movement on the island, causing it to narrow. ''This is not science-based management,'' they wrote. Eventually, Dr. Rees predicted, the public will understand that it will not be possible to protect all the buildings and roads and other infrastructure on the coast without destroying what people love about the landscape. ''They do not want to see a 40-foot-high seawall,'' she said. Dr. Rees predicted that the region would end up with a mix of solutions, including coastal armor but also ''buyout, relocation, flood-proofing, elevating houses.'' But no remedy is foolproof. Dr. Rees said, for example, that Hurricane Katrina destroyed a house she owned on Dauphin Island, Ala. ''The first floor of that house was plus-14,'' she said, referring to its elevation above sea level. ''If you start going much higher than that, not only is it very hard to access, but your construction considerations are tremendously magnified. On top of that, you put yourself into a totally different wind field.'' That tells her, she said, that ''trying to come up with a plan that would retain the quality of life but also try to put people out of harm's way is not going to be possible everywhere.'' ''Basically,'' Dr. Rees said, ''all we can do is educate the community.'' But in the 30 years that she has lived in the region, she said, people seem to be learning the wrong lessons. Devastating coastal storms now serve not as warnings but as engines of development, sweeping existing structures away and leaving clear land for bigger and better buildings. ''That's been a typical response since the early 1980s,'' Dr. Rees said. ''In the Gulf Shores-Orange Beach area, they went from almost 100 percent single-family residences and very small hotels to high rise after high rise after high rise,'' she said. Seeing that stretch of Alabama coast today, she said, ''you could not in your wildest dreams imagine what it looked like then. It was a very nice place to live.''"
"SO you've designed a house in Miami that takes advantage of the near-tropical climate by forgoing any enclosure between the living spaces and the bedrooms. Instead, a spare courtyard bisects the house, cut along its length by a lap pool. A narrow concrete bridge takes you from one side of the pool to the other. It's gorgeous, stone simple. But what do you do when it rains? ''You get wet,'' said John Bennett, an architect who designed just such a house with Terence Riley, the former chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art and, since March, the director of the Miami Art Museum. They now share the house. You do get wet. But showing a visitor around the house last week during an evening downpour -- as the city prepared to be inundated by hipsters attending the Art Basel Miami Beach art fair, which starts today -- Mr. Bennett and Mr. Riley didn't seem to mind the rain. It's Miami, after all; the rain was warm. And the chance of a random drenching just adds another level of fun to a house that seems to toggle from academic severity to party-pad louche. ''It was meant for bathing suits,'' Mr. Riley said of the house, ''not business suits.'' The New York firm K/R, which he founded in the 1980s with John Keenen, acted as project architects, producing the drawings and helping to refine the details. The landscape -- dense, enclosed gardens front and rear -- was executed by a Miami designer Mr. Riley refers to as ''the improbably named'' Raymond Jungles. The result is a house that is at once a love letter to the spirit of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and an earnest proposition about how one might live in a city like Miami, which has been experiencing a residential building boom. In addition to his iconic skyscrapers, the Barcelona chair and the phrase ''less is more,'' Mies van der Rohe is known for his residential work, not just the famous Farnsworth House in Plano, Ill., but also a series of studies for houses that were in many ways Farnsworth's opposite. Where that house, in a rural setting, is an experiment in transparency -- all walls are glass and dainty steel -- these other houses, known as the court houses, were urban introverts. None of them were ever built; many were developed only as a design problem for Mies's students at the Illinois Institute of Technology. But several illustrations of the concept exist: drawings that show what life might be like in an impeccably proportioned, well-detailed house that sits within its own concrete walls, looking out only to its own serene closed court. It was that vision that entranced the two architects as they were working on the 2001 ''Mies in Berlin'' show at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Bennett developing computer-rendered reconstructions with his business partner, the architect Gustavo Bonevardi, and Mr. Riley curating. ''We wanted to live in those drawings, basically,'' Mr. Bennett said. And now they do. They modeled the concept -- four walls on the perimeter spanned by two planar roofs, a court in between -- after those unrealized houses, and they weren't averse to an even more palpable nod to Mies. In several studies, Mies pasted in excerpts of paintings by Georges Braque, floor to ceiling, as a suggested wall treatment. Mr. Bennett and Mr. Riley did the same; just inside the door of the house, one wall is covered with an overscaled Braque detail printed on laminate. Continuing in toward the central court, one finds a small living room furnished as if in a raid on the shops of the Miami Design District three blocks away. Floors and ceilings are concrete (the floors unfinished), with only a very few slender steel-pipe columns to suggest that the roof does not float on the white-painted side-walls of its own accord. It's luxury of a sort, modeled, Mr. Bennett said, after the feel of a Chelsea art gallery. Mr. Riley, meanwhile, says it's something more. ''It's pragmatism, like William James's pragmatism,'' he said, pointing out how resistance to hurricane-force winds helped shape the long wall of sliding glass panels that looks out on the pool. On the other side of the Braque-decorated wall is a photo mural by Richard Misrach of a lone bather in a vast expanse of ocean. Nearby, a sleek Bulthaup kitchen is hidden in one long, low island, every component but the sink sliding beneath the mirror-like stainless steel countertop. ''We wanted it to be a Donald Judd kitchen,'' Mr. Bennett said. Mr. Riley added: ''No one really cooks here anyway. It's more of an elaborate bar.'' As for parties, the house has seen its share. ''It's great to have people over to a house like this,'' Mr. Riley said. ''It's immediately fun.'' And afterward, taking advantage of the brutal concrete floors, Mr. Bennett said, ''we just hose it down.'' But the house also has a loftier function, at least in its designers' minds, as a model for local development. The house has a mirror-image neighbor, built at the same time, for the Design District developer Craig Robins, who sold it after completion. The two stand on a street typical of the area and much of Miami. Lined with small bungalows ranging in style from gingerbread to Spanish mission, it is big on charm but small on cohesion and privacy. ''What's left of Mies's vision of thriftiness and thoughtful use of materials?'' Mr. Riley said. ''To get this much privacy in another kind of house you'd have to go way out into the suburbs and find a much larger lot.'' ''The next step would be to do a street,'' Mr. Bennett added, ''to do both sides.'' To illustrate how such a street might look, Mr. Bennett cued up one of the videos from the 2001 Mies show at MoMA. A projector on the living room side of the courtyard sent an image over the pool and onto a wall on the bedroom wing: Mies's courtyard houses, in many details very much like this one, are slowly extruded from a plan before multiplying to fill an entire large block. It's not a bad vision. No one passing Mr. Bennett and Mr. Riley's concrete-fronted house would call it off-putting, despite the near total lack of transparency. And, with each house using nearly all its lot, it does seem like a sensible way to achieve both dignity and privacy in a dense city with a suitable climate. ''It's also interesting because it's an anti-real-estate typology,'' Mr. Riley said, warming to the topic. ''Real estate is 'location, location, location,' but this house can be built anywhere.'' (Anywhere you'd be willing to walk outside to get to the living room, at least.) That was enough pedagogy for Mr. Riley. ''I don't want you to think we sit around watching Mies videos all the time,'' he said. Other images, Beck and Bjork music videos, were soon being projected across the court and the house reverted to its more relaxed, bathing-suit incarnation. ''We've been encouraging artists to think of it as a venue,'' Mr. Riley said of his unique single-screen theater. Indeed, for the festivities surrounding this week's Art Basel Miami Beach art shows and associated Design Miami events, the two have commissioned a piece from the artist Matthew Weinstein that will flicker exclusively for the entertainment of friends and other visitors to the house. Rain or shine. House Proud"
"COLLEEN WILSON, a lawyer who relocated her family to St. Thomas for a job at a multinational insurance company this spring, has not rented a home since she was 21. Not in Britain, nor in Jamaica, nor in Florida. Here in the Virgin Islands, however, she has been renting a three-bedroom house for more than eight months. And she doesn't like it. ''Renting seems like such a waste,'' she said, of the modest house on a small lot in the eastern Red Hook section of the island that could be hers to own for slightly more than $1 million. ''But I'm just not comfortable with the range of prices here,'' she said. ''Based on the property values in Miami, where we lived before, I expected to purchase something nice for $500,000 or under within six to eight months of exploring the island. Everything I'm interested in is $1.2 million, and I can't see myself mortgaging my entire lifestyle to incur that kind of debt.'' The high prices would not have been an issue had Ms. Wilson and her husband, Ludlow Bailey, moved here five years ago, before a new government program to attract investment and businesses to the Virgin Islands drove up prices. Until recently, homes on the United States Virgin Islands -- made up of St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix -- were widely considered undervalued. The traditional housing market was dominated by a small group of retired or semiretired second-home buyers from the mainland who were undaunted by the prospect of growing old in an outpost environment that was not home to an abundance of medical specialists, state-of-the-art hospitals, department stores or even paved roads. In 1989, all three islands were ravaged by Hurricane Hugo, and in 1995, Hurricane Marilyn destroyed nearly 80 percent of the homes on St. Thomas. The economy sagged and the housing market softened further. Afterward, initiatives were undertaken to strengthen and diversify the economy, and in 2001 the Economic Development Commission was created. The commission offers companies a number of inducements, including a 90 percent exemption on local income taxes; a 90 percent exemption on dividends; a 100 percent exemption on gross receipts taxes; a 100 percent exemption on property taxes; a 100 percent exemption on excise taxes; and 1 percent customs duties. The creation of the commission was accompanied by an aggressive marketing campaign, which resulted in about 100 companies' moving to or expanding on the islands between 2002 and 2004, employing nearly 3,100 people. ''Of course there's a trade-off,'' said Nadine Marchena, the commission's assistant chief executive. ''In exchange for the benefits, we expect our companies to invest in the community. We ask them to buy locally, support regional charities and establish residency -- anything that demonstrates an intention to stay.'' The commission does not require the companies or their employees to buy real estate. But it did not take long for most of the newly imported chief executives to realize the tax benefits of buying. ''They made it their business to know everything there was to know about the agency and its benefits,'' Ms. Marchena said, ''to the point where they were functioning as ambassadors for the E.D.C., telling their clients why it would be beneficial for them to buy this or that property.'' The Virgin Islands housing market has changed dramatically since 2002. On St. Thomas, there are now 110 homes for sale, 44 of them listed for more than a $1 million. In 2006, 17 homes have sold for over $1 million, compared with one home that sold for $1.01 million in 2002. The St. John market has risen, too, because of a severely limited supply of housing: two-thirds of the island is a national park. And in St. Croix property values have also increased, though much less dramatically, because of its distance from the economic and tourism hub of St. Thomas and its less densely populated area. While the commission's efforts attracted wealthy professionals, they also gained the attention of federal officials. In 2004, the United States Treasury Department concluded that the commission's efforts were costing the federal government more than $1 billion a year in lost tax revenue. An investigation revealed a smattering of financial abuses coupled with lax residency requirements. The findings resulted in new residency rules, requiring all employees to be physically on the island for 183 days a year. ''Enrollment in the E.D.C. program has been adversely affected,'' said Nick Bailey, co-owner of John Foster Real Estate. ''Several of the E.D.C. companies were audited or couldn't meet the residency requirements, so they left. That put the brakes on the rapid, artificial inflation of the real estate market.'' Those people who bought or built expensive luxury homes were not in a hurry to sell for less than what they considered these homes to be worth, which resulted in a glut of high-end properties. ''The market has leveled off, but it isn't going down,'' said Dawn Wheatley, a broker with John Foster Real Estate, ''and the reason is a limited supply of inventory. Almost no new housing has been built in more than 20 years, and we're back to our original client base of second-home buyers from the U.S. The downside is that there are very few homes available in the under-$300,000 range.'' ''Even the average two-bedroom, two-bath condominium is going for between $400,000 and $700,000 now,'' she added. Prospective home buyers with limited resources might hope for some break in the market. For now, though, the market is strong, and residents breathed a sigh of relief this year when a gentle hurricane season left all three islands intact. More than eight months after her relocation, Colleen Wilson has put house-hunting on the back burner. ''We're still ready to buy the right property for the right price,'' she said. ''But I don't want a damaged place. Neither of us are particularly hands-on people.'' Yet not everyone is complaining about the market here. Aaron Black, a developer with a company called Labal, says he is not concerned about the flat property values. Labal was founded by Mr. Black's father, Gordon, who fashioned a viable business from a hobby of transforming hurricane-damaged properties into luxury homes and villas, then flipping them for a handsome profit. ''Fortunately for us,'' the younger Mr. Black said, ''a key factor beyond the E.D.C. that sustained real estate values here was and continues to be an abundance of baby boomer wealth. Don't forget, this is a generation that has been driven by their dreams and desires, and the kinds of properties we've been developing are compatible with that common fantasy of escaping to a tropical paradise.'' Neither of the men expressed concern about finding buyers for their two luxury properties on Frenchman's Bay and Magens Bay, listed at $4.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. ''It'll probably sell to someone from the States,'' said Gordon Black, standing beside a new infinity pool on the deck of his recently finished 4,250-square-foot property, Villa Cote Sud, on Frenchman's Bay. From there, a long staircase pauses at an outdoor shower before leading directly into some of the finest snorkeling grounds on the island. ''It might not go as quickly as it would have a couple of years ago,'' he said, ''but we can always rent it out in the meantime.'' NATIONAL PERSPECTIVES"
"ON a map, Madison Avenue and New Orleans are far apart. But a year after the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Katrina, the two are coming closer together. The anniversary this week is being marked with a spate of advertising, public relations and promotional campaigns on television, in print and online. The sponsors that are spending tens of millions of dollars on the efforts represent everything from tourist attractions and consumer products to organizations devoted to economic redevelopment and media companies that are covering the aftermath of the storm. A campaign for Southern Comfort liqueur, for instance, which carries the theme ''Start the music up,'' presents online video clips of performers from New Orleans ''picking up where they left off,'' as the ads put it, to encourage donations at a Web site (socomusicfund.org). Ads for the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans ask potential guests, ''Who needs reward points when you can earn karma points?'' The Ronald McDonald House Charities established by McDonald's is celebrating the reopening of its outpost in New Orleans, less than a year after the building was destroyed. Ads from the Discovery Channel cable network, promoting a documentary, ''Surviving Katrina,'' feature photographs of New Orleans residents juxtaposed against scenes of debris. And a campaign for the Louisiana Department of Economic Development shows business executives holding up a clean sheet of paper, symbolizing what the ads call an ''extraordinary opportunity'' for bold entrepreneurs. ''It's the work of a lifetime,'' said Pat McGuinness, a partner and director for creative content at Trumpet, an agency in New Orleans that is creating the state redevelopment campaign. Such ads, addressing topical issues, are using a tried-and-true marketing tactic known as borrowed interest. The goal is to gain attention by forging connections to events that consumers are following avidly, which can include presidential elections, Super Bowls, the Olympics, celebrity shenanigans and trends in popular culture. Yet when advertisers want to borrow the interest devoted to important news, the considerations are drastically different from when, say, they congratulate a swimmer for winning a gold medal or spoof a singer whose audition for ''American Idol'' was especially awful. The sensitivities involved in becoming associated with a serious subject mean that there is a fine line -- often hard to find -- between commemoration and exploitation or between taking a stand and taking advantage. For example, some British consumers are castigating Ryanair, a discount airline, for ads that they complain are trying to cash in on the disruptions caused by the terror alert this month. One Ryanair ad showed Winston Churchill flashing the ''V'' for victory sign under the headline ''Let's beat terrorism.'' Another ad, showing a horde of naked travelers, carried this headline: ''New airport security procedures put fun back into flying.'' Those involved in producing the campaigns devoted to Katrina acknowledge the challenges they face. ''It was a difficult assignment,'' said Robert LaBarge, creative director at Rawle Murdy Associates in Charleston, S.C., the agency for the Windsor Court, owned by Orient-Express Hotels. ''On the one hand, we have something to celebrate,'' he added, referring to the hotel's reopening after just a couple months. ''And on the other hand, it's a broken city.'' For inspiration, Mr. LaBarge said, ''I reached back to 9/11. I was living in New York City at the time. We said, 'We don't need people sending us flowers. We need people coming back to the city.' '' The ads make an appeal to stay at the Windsor Court ''whether you're interested in a weekend getaway, or in helping rebuild.'' The tone is intended to capture the playful spirit of New Orleans, Mr. LaBarge said, while remaining respectful. The campaign for Southern Comfort, which was created in New Orleans in 1874, is taking a similar tack. ''We wanted to do something that felt right, given what was happening post-Katrina,'' said Ann Stickler, global marketing director for Southern Comfort at Brown-Forman in Louisville, Ky., ''and still have the texture and thread of New Orleans running through our advertising.'' The solution was the ''Start the music up'' campaign, intended to dovetail with the brand's advertising, which carries the theme ''Start things up,'' but not directly peddle the product. Visitors to the music fund's Web site who donate $10 or more will receive a compact disk of performances by New Orleans musicians; the donations will be distributed through two charities, New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity and the New Orleans Musicians Hurricane Relief Fund. ''It's not talking about displaced artists; it's about finding musicians who are leading the way back,'' said Teddy Lynn, executive producer at the Arnold Entertainment Group in Los Angeles. His agency, which is creating the music campaign, is part of the Arnold Worldwide division of Havas, the agency of record for Southern Comfort. ''We decided to take a more optimistic view because we found the artists are tired of talking about the hurricane,'' Mr. Lynn said. ''They wanted to look forward and move on.'' Discovery Channel is also adopting an upbeat attitude for its campaign. ''Let's all discover the strength of the human spirit,'' declare the ads for the ''Surviving Katrina'' special, which the network ran last night. The campaign reflects the contents of the special, ''inspiring, heroic stories of individuals who survived,'' said Julie Willis, senior vice president for marketing at Discovery Channel in Silver Spring, Md., part of Discovery Communications. ''Hurricane Katrina brought out some of the worst in people,'' she added. ''We're focused on how it brought out the best in people.'' Like Southern Comfort, Discovery Channel is including a charitable component in its campaign. ''Your spare change can rebuild lives,'' the Discovery ads say. ''Help the survivors at discovery.com/katrina.'' Computer users will find information there about a project called Making Change for Katrina (makingchangeforkatrina.org), created by Cone, a Boston agency specializing in cause-related marketing, to benefit Habitat for Humanity. Ms. Willis said that Discovery Channel's media agency, PHD, brought together the network and Cone, which like PHD is owned by the Omnicom Group. For some working on Katrina campaigns, the efforts are personal as well as professional. ''I had four feet of water in my house,'' said Mr. McGuinness of the Trumpet agency, ''and just managed to get back in a month ago.'' ''We've spent our careers in New Orleans working on 'challenger brands,' '' he added, referring to products that lag leaders in their categories. ''We find ourselves by virtue of circumstance working on the ultimate challenger brands -- the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans -- in our own backyard.'' ADVERTISING"
"Space shuttle ground crews made preparations on Sunday for a Tuesday launching while also planning to roll the Atlantis back into its hangar to ride out an approaching tropical storm. National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers will meet again on Monday morning before making a decision. NASA had kept alive the possibility of sending Atlantis and its crew of six on a critical construction mission for the International Space Station. But as Tropical Storm Ernesto veered toward the western Florida coast, pushing winds and clouds ahead of it that would affect the east coast of the state and the Kennedy Space Center by midweek, workers started battening down rocket launching facilities. ''We really haven't lost our minds,'' William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, said of the competing activities. NASA wants to resume space station construction to try out new safety modifications and procedures, after making only two shuttle test flights since the 2003 Columbia disaster. The agency wants to fly three times before the end of the year to maintain a schedule to finish the station before the shuttle fleet retires in 2010. ''We have two competing objectives,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said at a news conference. ''One, we want to get the vehicle ready to fly. The other objective is we want to get the vehicle ready to roll back. They are not compatible. At some point in the sequence you have to give up one or the other.'' On Saturday, NASA postponed the planned Sunday launching of Atlantis by one day to examine the effects of a large lightning strike on the launching pad in a storm on Friday. The shuttle was not hit, but engineers were concerned about potential damage from a surge of electricity around the shuttle and associated ground equipment. On Sunday, managers pushed the next chance for a launching to Tuesday at 3:42 p.m. to give them more time to assess what impact the lightning might have had, if any. Mr. Gerstenmaier said that the shuttle and its external tank had essentially been cleared for flight, but that engineers were still looking at data to see if explosive bolts connected to the craft's large booster rocket might have been affected by a surge of current. If managers decide to move the shuttle back to the hangar, technicians will first have to drain onboard oxygen and hydrogen supplies that power the vehicle's fuel cells and make other critical preparations. The entire rollback process from the launching pad to the hangar takes about 48 hours, officials said. On its 11-day mission to the space station, Atlantis is to deliver a truss segment and a new solar power array, a complex assembly task requiring three spacewalks to complete."
"The storm called Ernesto headed north toward the Carolinas on Wednesday after puffing through much of Florida with no more vigor than an ordinary summer squall. The weakened storm, which briefly reached hurricane force south of Cuba, emerged into the Atlantic near Cape Canaveral late Wednesday and was expected to hit the Carolinas late Thursday with winds of perhaps 50 miles an hour. The National Hurricane Center said it was expected to regain some strength. Jack Beven, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said the storm would probably make landfall in South Carolina. But Mr. Beven said it could also stay at sea a bit longer and not turn inland again until reaching North Carolina. ''There's always that uncertainty,'' Mr. Beven said. ''It's always possible it could go a bit to the left or a bit to the right.'' In South Carolina, Charleston and the coastal counties announced the closing of government offices, schools and some medical centers on Thursday, but evacuation remained voluntary. In North Carolina, where state officials said they expected only minor flooding, Gov. Michael F. Easley activated 150 National Guard troops. The storm is expected to continue north from the Carolinas, diminishing and possibly bringing some wet weather to the Northeast. Forecasters had expected the storm to strike South Florida with winds of close to 74 m.p.h., the minimum speed for a hurricane, and to flood some areas. But it arrived with winds of 45 m.p.h. at most, and Max Mayfield, the director of the hurricane center, renewed an appeal to Congress for more money for research and tracking equipment. ''We don't know for sure why it didn't intensify'' after leaving Cuba, Mr. Mayfield told reporters. ''But it certainly underscores that we have to do a better job of intensity forecasting.'' Forecasters have improved their ability to estimate where a hurricane will strike. But fluctuations in atmospheric conditions that can dampen, strengthen and steer tropical storms limit their precision there as well. At their best, forecasters say that a day in advance they can estimate within about 70 miles where a storm will hit. In South Florida, the storm disrupted the lives of millions. Schools closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, as did most businesses shut. But there was little damage, and even the four to six inches of rain that fell was easily absorbed. Officials attributed one highway death to the storm, and two women were hospitalized after a steel hurricane shutter fell on them. Economists estimated the losses to businesses at less than $10 million. ''It was a very small blip in a state with an annual economy of $634 billion,'' said J. Antonio Villamil, chairman of Gov. Jeb Bush's council of economic advisers. The minor nature of the storm did not become fully clear in South Florida until late Tuesday."
"Jim Pozo felt he got a break on Wednesday when Tropical Storm Ernesto turned out to be nothing more than a slightly windy rainstorm as it crossed South Florida. And that was not just because his three-bedroom house near downtown Miami was unscathed. He had been worried, he said, that a storm causing even modest damage would push up his already sky-high insurance premiums. ''I don't know how people can afford it at these rates,'' said Mr. Pozo, a real estate broker and investor. Another big storm, he said ''is just going to make it go up more.'' All along the coasts, from Texas to New England, insurers suffering from hurricane jitters are raising rates and cutting back on coverage. But nowhere is the situation more severe than in Florida, particularly here in South Florida and in the Florida Panhandle, where storms in recent years have added billions to the insurers' losses. ''Even though this was a very mild tropical storm, it reminds the insurance industry of the risk involved in underwriting insurance in Florida and will make them even more cautious,'' said J. Antonio Villamil, the chairman of Gov. Jeb Bush's council of economic advisers and the chief executive of the Washington Economics Group, an economic and business consultant in Coral Gables. ''The bottom line is, this storm didn't help,'' he said. State officials are stymied on what to do about the problem. They can hope, like Mr. Pozo, that the next three months of hurricane season will be as benign as the first three. The officials have been struggling to restrain rising prices, but they know the more pressure they put on company profits, the more the companies will cut back on the amount of coverage they offer. Insurers like State Farm and Allstate have already cut back significantly and, as a result, the state-run insurance agency -- Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, the insurance company of last resort -- has become the biggest insurer in the state with about one million policies. Governor Bush and other officials are considering whether to call a special session of the State Legislature to wrestle with insurance issues. Florida has also taken the lead in pushing for the creation of a federal insurance program that would relieve some of the strain, not only on hurricane-prone states but also on states like California, where earthquakes are the demon. Insurance prices have been climbing in Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 cost the insurers $21.5 billion in today's dollars. That storm stood for years as the most costly hurricane until Hurricane Katrina a year ago led to more than $41 billion in insurance payouts. Insurance prices here escalated sharply after seven hurricanes hit the state in 2004 and 2005 and as weather forecasters predicted that the particularly bad run of hurricanes could keep going for at least the next decade. Finding coverage at any cost is becoming increasingly difficult. Allstate, for example, has begun turning down renewals for more than 200,000 customers and turning them over to smaller companies with less robust finances, adding to feelings of insecurity among homeowners. State Farm has notified many condominium associations that it plans to stop insuring them. Over the last year, insurance prices for many homeowners in Florida have jumped at least 20 to 40 percent, on top of several previous increases. And those homeowners have been the lucky ones. Along the beaches and even near the water, coverage costs have doubled this year for many homes and are now the most expensive in the country, industry officials say. At renewal time this year, the annual premiums on Mr. Pozo's house jumped to $6,000, from $4,000. Worse, the insurer that had been providing wind coverage for a 34-unit apartment building that Mr. Pozo owns refused to renew his policy. Mr. Pozo had never filed a claim. The apartment building is not near water and is sturdily built of concrete blocks with a solid roof. The bank that holds Mr. Pozo's $1.3 million mortgage insisted upon insurance. The bank found an insurer willing to provide coverage, but at staggering rates and on unusual terms: month to month through the six months of the hurricane season. For the first two months, Mr. Pozo said, the premium was $1,600 a month. Then it jumped to $5,000 and for the remaining three months of the season, he said, it will be $8,400 a month. To top things off, the special policy comes with a deductible of $100,000. Mr. Pozo had no choice. He could either pay the insurance rates or lose his mortgage. ''The insurance companies just say it's too hazardous, too risky,'' Mr. Pozo said. ''The bank has to protect itself.'' In the suburban town of Palmetto Bay, just south of Miami, Carla and Richard Gordon were hit with a 51 percent increase in the cost of their wind insurance, which rose to $3,871 a year. They had a separate policy on their four-bedroom Mediterranean-style home, two miles from Biscayne Bay. It jumped 31 percent, to $2,400 a year. The wind policy carries an $8,000 deductible. Like many people, the Gordons are having a hard time understanding the steep increases. Their home was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, and when they rebuilt they wanted to make sure they were secure. ''We have every single safety thing you can put in a house,'' Mrs. Gordon said. ''Our house was built above and beyond the codes. We have orange curved roof tiles. But they're made of cement, not clay.'' The Gordons had expected the stronger house would get them a break on their insurance prices. But it has not worked out that way. Mrs. Gordon, an elementary school teacher, said her next-door neighbor was paying even more for wind insurance, about $5,900. Mr. Gordon's brother lives in Hollywood, about 20 miles north of Miami. His premiums doubled, to about $4,000, Mr. Gordon said. ''Everybody I know has gotten major increases,'' Mr. Gordon said. Still, the insurance companies say regulators are preventing them from raising prices enough to reflect the true cost of providing insurance in Florida. In the last two years, the insurers have paid out $31 billion for claims in Florida, or about three-quarters of the $41 billion they paid for damage from Hurricane Katrina in half a dozen states, according to Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. Florida, like Mississippi and Louisiana, created a state-run insurance company to provide coverage when companies like Allstate and State Farm would not. Without the ability to get home insurance, people would be unable to get mortgages and housing sales would stall. But after Hurricane Katrina and the other recent hurricanes, these state-run insurance companies are all in financial trouble. In Florida, for example, the state-run company, Citizens, was more than $2 billion in the red at the end of last year. To bail it out, the State Legislature allocated $715 million in tax receipts for Citizens this year and permitted it to sell bonds. In addition, Citizens was allowed to raise money from the private insurers with assessments that the companies are then passing on to policyholders, further adding to the policyholders' costs. The coverage the state-run companies offer is truly a last resort. Unlike most private home insurance policies, those provided by the state, at equally high prices, do not provide for the full cost of replacing a destroyed house, and instead of paying the cost of replacing furnishings, the state policies reimburse at the depreciated value of furniture and clothes. Imagine, for example, the value today of a couch purchased 10 years ago for $1,500. Insurance from a state-run insurance agency might pay $150 toward a new couch that today might cost $2,500. Some of the steepest price increases, industry officials say, have come in Pensacola and other towns in the Florida Panhandle that were heavily damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Dennis in 2005. Mr. Hartwig said the insurers had paid most of the three million claims from the seven hurricanes in the last two years. But the South Florida landscape is still dotted with homes with blue tarpaulins tied down over them as temporary roofs. Except in the Panhandle region, there has not been much flooding in Florida. That is in contrast to the damage from Katrina, where flooding was the main destroyer. A consequence of the high insurance costs in Florida, and especially the high deductibles, is that homeowners are taking extra steps to prevent damage. As the first winds of Tropical Storm Ernesto were brushing South Florida earlier this week, Mrs. Gordon hired a handyman to put up storm shutters. ''I don't think this storm is going to be too bad,'' Mrs. Gordon said, ''but I have an $8,000 deductible.''"
"Federal officials modestly downgraded their projections for the intensity of this year's hurricane season on Tuesday, as the halfway point of the six-month season neared without a single hurricane and only three named tropical storms. What is obvious already, officials said, is that this year is unlikely to match the activity of last year when there were a record 15 hurricanes; seven were major, and four, including Katrina, hit the United States. By this date in 2005, there had been nine named storms and four hurricanes. But officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned that the threat was still real for an above-average hurricane season, as has been the case in 9 of the last 11 years. They now predict seven to nine hurricanes, including three or four that have sustained winds of at least 111 miles per hour, or Category 3 storms. The seasonal average is six. The agency's forecast was similar to that made last week by hurricane researchers at Colorado State University, who reduced their number of hurricanes predicted to seven from nine. Three of those storms would be intense, the researchers said. ''While the beginning of this hurricane season has been relatively calm compared to last year, it does not mean we are off the hook,'' said the under secretary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Conrad C. Lautenbacher. Mr. Lautenbacher and Gerry Bell, the agency's lead seasonal hurricane forecaster, said the relatively quiet early half of the season was not that unusual, as the peak typically runs from mid-August to mid-October. Mr. Bell said the revised prediction was based on factors including sea surface temperatures. The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, R. David Paulison, said residents along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts must still take steps to prepare themselves. ''It is not a time for complacency,'' Mr. Paulison said. ''It only takes one hurricane to give you a very bad day.'' The downgrade in the projection is particularly a relief for the Gulf Coast, where 119,000 families are still living in government-supplied travel trailers or mobile homes, which officials say they will urge people to vacate even if winds reach only tropical-force speed. ''We are going to plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' said Mark C. Smith, spokesman for the Louisiana governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness."
"As Tropical Storm Beryl whipped up the seas along the mid-Atlantic coast this summer, officials monitoring the storm inside the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters could watch both sides of the action. On one computer monitor was the National Weather Service image of the storm, spinning slowly toward New England. Nearby was FEMA's high-tech counterpunch: a digital map of the United States with a swarm of Pac-Man-like dots representing FEMA trucks moving disaster relief supplies toward the expected impact zone. The tracking system is a concrete sign of progress for an agency that, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, became an international symbol of dysfunction and incompetence. But the system is set up for only a sliver of the country and includes just a fraction of the aid sent to the field. It is emblematic of how inconsistent progress has been in preparing the nation for disasters, one year after the hurricane and five years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. In the last year, FEMA, the federal government's primary disaster response agency and overseer of state and local efforts, has adopted policies to help prevent fraud and wasteful spending, strengthened its ties with other federal agencies for help with evacuations and emergency medical aid and installed high-tech equipment, like the supply-tracking system. After a prolonged search, it hired a new director, R. David Paulison, a former chief of the Miami-Dade Fire Department, and significantly built up its executive ranks with more seasoned emergency managers. Despite calls by many FEMA critics, though, little has fundamentally changed about the agency itself, which still has less autonomy and power than it did in the Clinton years and a budget for its core mission that has not significantly increased. The inconsistencies are apparent elsewhere. Along the Gulf Coast and in other locations struck by disaster, like New York City, important advances have been made to prepare for the next catastrophe. In New Orleans, extraordinary steps have been taken to care for the disabled, the elderly and tens of thousands of others without cars if another major hurricane arrives. In New York, city officials say, up to three million people could be evacuated from coastal areas and 600,000 accommodated in shelters stocked with food and supplies. But in large chunks of the country, far more limited progress has been made to prepare for catastrophe, a recent federal assessment concluded. The Department of Homeland Security, FEMA's parent agency, rated only 27 percent of the states and 10 percent of the cities evaluated as adequately prepared ''to cope with a catastrophic event.'' Dallas, Milwaukee, Oklahoma City and Philadelphia were among the low scorers. In Philadelphia, for example, emergency radio systems are not reliable throughout city, plans to care for the elderly and the disabled are not complete, shelter space is insufficient and contracts for emergency supplies mostly do not exist -- all lapses that contributed to the debacle in New Orleans last year. The uneven preparation has left many emergency-response experts, including senior Bush administration officials, uneasy. ''There is not a governor nor major-city mayor in America who does not know that all eyes will be watching them when the next major disaster occurs,'' said George W. Foresman, under secretary for preparedness at the Department of Homeland Security. ''But generally speaking, if you ask the question 'Are they ready?' it is not where it needs to be. And that is the understatement of the day.'' Mr. Paulison, the FEMA director, acknowledged in a briefing this month that while progress had been made, his agency had not finished the task of retooling itself. ''We cannot let the deaths and the suffering of those Katrina victims go in vain,'' he said. ''We have to take those lessons learned and make sure that this organization, primarily FEMA, but the entire federal government, is capable of responding in a much more nimble and much more effective way.'' Ready to Roll At Camp Beauregard, a Louisiana National Guard training ground far from the vulnerable Gulf Coast, FEMA has set up a sprawling disaster depot. Load after load of bottled water, ready-to-eat meals, cots, tarps, blankets and sheets of plastic have been assembled this year, each movement of goods tracked by FEMA's new satellite system. But instead of holding the supplies at the centrally located camp as FEMA mostly did last year, the agency distributed them across the state, to sites including New Orleans and surrounding parishes hit hard by Hurricane Katrina. With these and other stockpiles -- at least twice the inventory dispersed before the hurricane last August -- FEMA officials say they have enough supplies to care for one million people for a week. ''We have moved the trailers by the hundreds,'' said Garrison Martin, the FEMA manager of the Camp Beauregard complex, watching as forklifts brought in more goods. ''We can meet the need if a disaster was to happen again.'' Mr. Martin and other federal, state and local officials in Louisiana have a palpable sense of urgency in preparing for another hurricane or other disaster. They have pieced together a regional response plan that has few precedents in American history. Federal officials say that if a major hurricane threatens the Louisiana coast this year, they will be ready before the storm to help move up to 80,000 people by bus and 61,000 by plane or train -- almost everyone in the region without cars, including tourists. Federal and state officials have also found shelters safely away from the coast for as many as 250,000 people. The Defense Department, at FEMA's request, has contracted with suppliers to deliver diesel fuel and gasoline in hurricane-prone states for generators and vehicles along escape routes. The Pentagon is also prepared to step in and help with rescues, medical evacuations, delivery of heavy equipment and road clearing, as well as to provide 15,000 to 20,000 active duty troops to maintain order and offer other assistance. The Department of Transportation is even paying for 200 buses simply to sit in the Gulf region this summer, just in case they are needed for evacuations. The most detailed planning involves caring for the sick, the elderly and the disabled, for whom the government and institutional failures last year proved most deadly. After the hurricane, residents of Maison Hospitalière, a nursing home off Bourbon Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, had to wait four days in the stifling heat until they were evacuated. Without air-conditioning, the temperatures climbed so high that two residents died while waiting for rescuers. ''Things will be different this year,'' said Andrew B. Sandler, the nursing home administrator. Now Mr. Sandler has a contract with a bus company that vows it will honor an agreement to move his residents if necessary, as well as a contract with a company that manages three nursing homes inland to accept his residents. And if his plans fall through, state and federal officials say they will step in to take care of them. Federal officials know that some havoc would be inevitable in an evacuation of New Orleans. But they are using every moment of this hurricane season to prepare to deal with another storm. ''Every day we have where we don't have a hurricane, we will be able to take it a little bit further,'' said Gil H. Jamieson, who is coordinating FEMA's efforts along the Gulf Coast. Untested in the Northeast Dr. Harvey Rubin's expertise is in infectious diseases, not disaster management. But from the top floor of a hospital at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Rubin had no trouble pointing out where catastrophes could unfold in Philadelphia. To the south, sandwiched among a residential neighborhood, the airport and three sports complexes, is a giant Sunoco oil refinery. It processes a highly flammable product and stores hundreds of thousands of pounds of hydrogen fluoride, an extremely toxic chemical used to make high-octane fuels. If the chemical was released into the air by an accident or a terrorist act, a poisonous, ground-hugging cloud could threaten hundreds of thousands of residents for miles away. To the east, behind office towers, are the city's historic icons, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall; beyond them is the container-ship port. All are considered possible terrorist targets. Philadelphia is not at high risk for a natural disaster, but like many other major metropolitan areas, it is vulnerable to industrial accidents and terrorist strikes. Yet when Mayor John F. Street ordered a review of how prepared the city was for a major catastrophe, the results were far from reassuring. ''We have done well, luckily, with the typical disaster,'' said Dr. Rubin, director of the University of Pennsylvania Institute for Strategic Threat Analysis and Response and co-chairman of the study. ''But the big catastrophe -- we have not been tested. It would not be smooth.'' Evacuation plans for the city, even if only part of it had to be cleared, are so unspecific that even some agencies expected to play a critical role do not know what to do, the report said. The city, which has 1.5 million residents, has few plans to evacuate the elderly or people without cars. Stockpiles of food and supplies would be sufficient for only about 15,000 residents, with few contracts arranged to quickly bring in large amounts of additional supplies. The police and fire emergency radio communication systems are unreliable on the underground sections of the city subway. The ambulance dispatching system does not allow city rescue crews to communicate directly with hospitals. So little thought, in fact, had gone into disaster planning that city officials had not even set up antiterrorist traffic barriers around the police headquarters, which also houses the 911 dispatch center. (Barriers have recently been installed.) Left to Fend for Itself The findings, issued in June, reflected conclusions reached the same month by the Department of Homeland Security and last month by the United States Conference of Mayors. ''Significant weaknesses in evacuation planning are an area of profound concern,'' the department's report said. The mayors' conference report noted that communications systems in 80 percent of the cities were not sophisticated enough to allow all public safety and rescue workers to talk to one another, a goal the study's authors said would take on average four years to achieve. Some states, including Florida, North Carolina and Texas, received decent grades in the Homeland Security Department survey, largely because of the frequent tests they face from hurricanes. Certain high-risk targets like Washington and New York also did relatively well, thanks to steps taken since 2001. Some measures FEMA has taken in the last year -- like establishing federal reconnaissance teams that can fly in and report back on conditions even if local communications networks are knocked out -- could compensate for some of the preparedness lapses. FEMA has also doubled, to 200,000 a day, its capacity to field telephone calls from victims who want to register for financial aid. Yet many aspects of the enhanced federal response effort are limited to particularly vulnerable areas, like southeastern Louisiana. Much of the rest of the country would have to fend largely for itself after a disaster until federal help could be mobilized, perhaps as much as 48 to 72 hours later. With most areas inadequately prepared, that could be precarious, federal officials and emergency managers acknowledge. ''Time and again, these factors exact a severe penalty in the midst of a crisis: Precious time is consumed in the race to correct the misperceptions of federal, state and local responders about roles, responsibilities and actions,'' the federal survey of states and cities warned. ''The result is uneven performance and repeated and costly operational miscues.'' Philadelphia officials have been commended for producing such a blunt report that identifies gaps in their preparedness. But for area residents like Theresa Jones, who lives near the oil refinery, and Charlie Tomlinson, who rides the subway, the city's vulnerabilities are worrisome. ''If something happens here, we are just cooked,'' Ms. Jones said. ''We will be fried chicken.'' Pedro A. Ramos, Philadelphia's top administrative official, said residents should rest assured that Philadelphia was moving energetically to fill the gaps in its disaster plan. ''You never know what you don't know until you go looking for it,'' Mr. Ramos said. But as a subway car pulled into an underground station near City Hall, Mr. Tomlinson said he could not help but wonder why it had taken the city so long to get serious about preparedness. ''You would have thought that now that we are five years past Sept. 11 that someone would have addressed this,'' Mr. Tomlinson said. ''It is a little scary.''

"A federal judge in Mississippi sided with home insurance companies yesterday and ruled that they did not have to pay for the flooding that destroyed tens of thousands of homes in Hurricane Katrina. Insurers have already paid $17.6 billion for damage to homes from Katrina that was attributed to wind only. But this was a victory for the companies, because they could have been forced to pay out untold billions more if they had been required to cover damage from flooding caused by the storm. Several hundred thousand homes were damaged or destroyed by Katrina. It was not a total victory, however. The judge rejected attempts by the insurers to cancel coverage for wind damage when it occurred in combination with the flooding. That aspect of his decision, in the first trial over disputed claims of damage from the hurricane, favored storm victims and could cost the insurers hundreds of millions of dollars. Now homeowners whose claims have been denied may have the opportunity to present proof in court that at least some of the damage resulted from wind -- which is the main protection provided by home insurance policies in hurricanes. For the couple who brought the lawsuit, Paul and Julie Leonard of Pascagoula, Miss., the ruling means that they will receive about $3,000 to cover damage to their home, rather than the more than $130,000 they had sought. But their lawyer, Richard F. Scruggs, said the ruling was ''going to open the door for recovery for thousands of Mississippi homeowners.'' Lawyers for both the insurers and the plaintiffs saw good news in the decision. ''We're gratified that the major provisions of the standard homeowners insurance policy were upheld,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. Mr. Hartwig said the issue of paying for combined wind and water damage ''will probably be the subject of further judicial review.'' Mr. Scruggs said he disagreed with the decision that exempted insurers from flood coverage in general. But he said the ruling against the insurers had ''so much upside for the homeowners on the Gulf'' of Mexico. Homeowners and the insurance industry had watched the case closely as the first test of whether insurers are responsible for paying for damages caused by both wind and water. The insurers had claimed their policies ruled out coverage for flooding. Lawyers representing homeowners argued that in selling home insurance with many references to windstorms and hurricanes, the insurance companies led customers to believe that any hurricane damage -- from wind or water -- would be covered. The ruling therefore upholds a longstanding practice of insurers of not covering flood damage, which is typically insured through the federal government. The ruling, by Judge L. T. Senter Jr. of Federal District Court in Gulfport, applied directly to Nationwide Mutual Insurance, which had been sued by the Leonards. Judge Senter presided over the trial as judge and jury. He is also presiding over nearly all of the hundreds of lawsuits that are pending in federal court in Gulfport over insurance claims from Hurricane Katrina. His ruling in the Nationwide case is expected to guide his handling of the other disputes. Hundreds of other cases are pending in state court. ''For other judges hearing these cases, this is obviously going to be the most important decision they look to,'' said Adam F. Scales, who teaches insurance law at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer who represents insurance companies, said that while many would see the verdict as a victory for insurers, ''Judge Senter has also laid the groundwork for homeowners to do very well in these cases.'' Judge Senter said Nationwide's home insurance policy was clear in its refusal to cover flood damage. But he said the section that asserted that Nationwide had no liability for either wind or water damage when they occurred in combination or within a few hours of each other was ambiguous. In earlier, less definitive rulings, Judge Senter found that similar language in the policies of State Farm and Allstate, which are fighting hundreds of their own lawsuits, was also ambiguous. ''The judge rejected the most extreme position offered by both sides,'' Mr. Scales said. ''The position that storm surge or hurricane flooding is covered was never very plausible. But it was just as implausible that if there is any water involved, the insurers don't have to pay anything.'' In his ruling yesterday, Judge Senter said that the wind damage was covered ''even if the wind damage occurred concurrently or in sequence with the excluded water damage.'' Judge Senter said most of the damage to the Leonards' home in Pascagoula was the result of flooding, and thus Nationwide was not required to pay the full amount the Leonards were demanding. Nationwide had paid the Leonards $1,661.17 for wind damage. Judge Senter said that, because of what he determined to be additional wind damage, they were entitled to another $1,228.16. ''We didn't bring home the full measure of damages for the Leonard family,'' Mr. Scruggs said. ''But they cleared a big path for all the other homeowners on the Gulf Coast.'' In the Nationwide lawsuit, Mr. Scruggs, representing the Leonards, asserted that his clients had been misled by their insurance agent. Mr. Leonard testified that the agent had told him that he did not need to buy flood insurance from the federal government. Mr. Scruggs argued that Mr. Leonard, a police lieutenant, had reasonably concluded that his home insurance policy provided everything he needed to protect him in a hurricane. But Judge Senter said that while he believed that the agent had advised against buying flood insurance, he did not agree that the agent had, in effect, verbally expanded the coverage of the home insurance policy to include flood damage. Nationwide said that it was ''very pleased'' by the decision. It did not comment on Judge's Senter's ruling that some of the language in its policies was ambiguous and that claims for wind damage could not be rejected merely because the damage had occurred in combination with flooding. The company said it would ''continue to adjust claims on a case-by-case basis.'' The ruling, it added, ''underscores just how important it is for all policyholders to carefully read and understand the terms of the coverage they purchase.'' The insurance industry had argued that a ruling requiring insurers to pay all flood damage would have meant that their policies or contracts could be rewritten by the courts, and might have led some of them to withdraw from the home insurance business."
"Betty Smith's cream-colored house near a highway overpass looked painfully vulnerable on Tuesday as Tropical Storm Ernesto approached, with half of its roof draped in blue plastic, the other half still stripped of shingles after last year's hurricanes. ''I think it'll be all right,'' Mrs. Smith, 66, said as the skies darkened and the first rain bands from the storm began to batter Miami-Dade County on Tuesday afternoon. With the slow-moving storm threatening strong winds and 5 to 10 inches of rainfall overnight, others were not as optimistic. Thousands of roofs in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties remain damaged from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2005, and officials urged the people who live beneath them to seek surer cover. ''We've implored people that have blue tarps to contact friends, family, neighbors and to ride out the storm someplace else,'' said Mayor Carlos Alvarez of Miami-Dade County in a news conference. Late Tuesday, the storm made landfall on Plantation Key, with maximum sustained winds near 45 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters said tropical-storm-force winds of at least 40 m.p.h. could spread through South Florida overnight, with heavy rains lashing the peninsula before the storm exited the state on Wednesday night near Daytona Beach. But a hurricane watch for South Florida was canceled at 8 p.m. Mike Brennan, a meteorologist with the hurricane center, said the storm's broad, disorganized center could mean heavy rain and winds for both of the state's coasts. When Hurricane Irene, a similarly slow storm, plodded across South Florida in 1999, it dumped up to 20 inches of rain in some regions. But Mark McInerney, another meteorologist at the center, said Tropical Storm Ernesto would probably not grow into a hurricane even if it moved into the Atlantic and toward South Carolina. ''Our best forecasts show it will reach real close but not make it,'' Mr. McInerney said. A spokesman for the South Florida Water Management District, which started dumping water from drainage canals into the Atlantic on Sunday in anticipation of the storm, said the canals had ''plenty of capacity'' to handle storm water runoff. ''We are ready,'' said the spokesman, Randy Smith. ''We have moved billions and billions of gallons of water out of the canals.'' Although engineers warned earlier this year that the aging dike around Lake Okeechobee, the vast, murky body of water west of Palm Beach, could collapse in a strong hurricane, Mr. Smith said dangerous flooding was not a threat right now because the lake was so low. The lake level is currently about 12 feet deep, he said, and the Army Corps of Engineers considers it unsafe at 17.5 feet. Although many people here did not bother boarding up their windows or putting on storm shutters, the Green Street Café in Coconut Grove was playing it safe. Aziz Momin, the manager, was putting up shutters and stacking tables, chairs and sofas behind the bars. ''I see lots of places with bigger glass than us, and they're not putting up shutters,'' Mr. Momin said. ''But we didn't want to take a chance.'' A few couples were sipping wine and nibbling at lunches. Scott Benesch, the director of equity research at U. S. Trust, an investment company, said he had spent the morning tidying the grounds outside his new house. Mr. Benesch moved to Florida from New York last month, he said, but had already learned some old tricks. ''I popped the coconuts out of my trees,'' he said. ''I didn't want them to become projectiles.'' With the rain expected to be intense, leaking roofs promised to be among the bigger problems presented by the storm. From 10,000 to 12,000 roofs of single-family homes in Miami-Dade County and 8,000 in Broward County were still covered with blue tarps that the Army Corps of Engineers provided after last year's storms, said Ron Book, co-chairman of the Partnership for Recovery, a public-private group created to help find housing for poor families after Hurricane Wilma. ''After every major rainstorm in July we had more horror stories of people's ceilings falling in and residences becoming that much more uninhabitable,'' Mr. Book said. ''I can't imagine that the situation tomorrow is going to be very pretty.'' In Lauderhill, near Fort Lauderdale, Teresa Lasley was hoping her home would withstand the drenching. She lost half the shingles on her roof last year, she said, and was still searching for a contractor ''who isn't charging an arm and a leg.'' A few blocks away, Susie Walker said she was still waiting for her insurance company to send a check for repairs to her tarp-clad roof. ''We have been trying to patch it up,'' Ms. Walker said. ''They estimated, but they didn't pay us like they were supposed to.'' Gov. Jeb Bush said 200 National Guard troops had been deployed and 15 shelters had opened in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties."
"South Floridians began hoarding gasoline and other emergency supplies Monday as Tropical Storm Ernesto threatened to strike here, possibly as a hurricane, Tuesday night or early Wednesday. Though it was too soon to know how powerful the storm might become after leaving Cuba and crossing the warm water of the Florida Straits, schools and courts announced they would close on Tuesday -- the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina -- and on Wednesday. Miami-Dade and Broward Counties prepared to open shelters, and Broward officials ordered a mandatory evacuation of mobile homes. Conditions were ripe for the storm to strengthen after leaving Cuba, forecasters said, with the strait's waters strikingly warm and vertical wind shear low. But the storm's dawdling journey across Cuba could weaken it so much that it would not have time to strengthen much before reaching Florida, they said. Before it was downgraded to a tropical storm, the storm briefly became the first hurricane of the season on Sunday. Even if it does not grow back into a hurricane, the forecasters said, the storm could inflict significant damage on parts of the state, with winds of up to 70 miles per hour. ''We can't pinpoint an exact place for landfall,'' said Jamie Rhome, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, ''but anyone in the cone should continue to prepare.'' The ''cone of probability'' for a strike, as predicted by the center, includes the entire Florida Peninsula, the eastern half of Georgia, most of South Carolina and a big chunk of North Carolina. Ben Nelson, Florida's meteorologist, said much of the state could see heavy rain and strong gusty winds. Gov. Jeb Bush said there were enough supplies for everyone. Among them, Mr. Bush said, was a record 295 million gallons of fuel on hand at state ports. ''There's not going to be a shortage, so people don't have to overreact,'' the governor said at a news conference in Tallahassee. ''They just need to make sure that they have enough fuel to take care of their families.'' Still, multitudes cleared stores of staple foods and parked in lines for gasoline that were hours long. More than a few honked impatiently or tried to cut in front of others. ''I know this is just what we have to do,'' said Gary Tarron, 49, a real estate agent who was in a line of at least 60 cars at a Hess station in North Bay Village. ''I had a half a tank, but I've learned from my mistakes. This year, people seem more aware. Last year there was no money and no gas.'' Mr. Bush and other state officials said that if emergency supplies like ice and water were necessary, they would probably have a minimal role in distributing them. ''Unless the storm strengthens significantly,'' said Craig Fugate, the state's emergency management chief, ''we think a lot of this will actually be handled by the retail sector and the local governments.'' At the same time, though, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it had about 600 trucks loaded with food, water, ice and tarps ready to send to affected areas."
"We spent countless hours and thousands of dollars over the past two years preparing for hurricanes, even installing a generator. After Wilma, lots of folks came to our home to use percolators, charge cellphones, etc. Many have done nothing to prepare for this hurricane season. What do we do after a power outage when they knock at our door at 7 a.m., Mr. Coffee in hand? (Keep in mind, we plan to continue living in this neighborhood.) Marilyn Cane, Plantation, FLa. You say yes to a neighbor's request to store his insulin in your refrigerator, no to recharging his electric toothbrush. That is, accept necessity, reject luxury and anticipate that saying no will provoke both understanding and resentment. I sympathize. We 284 million non-Floridians ask similar questions every hurricane season when you put in for public money to rebuild. Year after year. After year. While we are responsive to people in dire straits, we think it significant that many of you choose to live in a place called Hurricane Alley. As you observe about your neighbors, it is predictable that you'll face similar problems in the future. Wouldn't it be prudent to prepare? It may appear unseemly to rebuff someone knocking at your door, depleted iPod in hand (or you knocking at mine, toting a bushel basket to haul away money we'd hoped to use for our schools). You can't turn your back on suffering, but you can urge local officials to prepare. And cranky people like me can support national policies that free us from responsibility for repairing the beach houses of those who have a choice yet knowingly set up housekeeping on the slopes of a volcano just above a fault line in the plague-of-locusts district. Such policies can include zoning laws, insurance requirements and construction standards. Knowing how you feel about your neighbors, I'm sure I can count on your support. My father always told us kids that we were ''part Indian.'' After his parents died, his stories grew even grander. My brother took them seriously enough to apply and get in to grad school as an American Indian. As time has passed, this has proved to be untrue. Does he have an obligation to repay any grants or other privileges received? name withheld, Portland, Ore. Or to put it another way: should the sins of the fathers be visited on their very pale children? Your brother cannot be faulted morally for believing what his father repeated throughout your brother's childhood. It is your father who did wrong, in a small way, by indulging in a kind of ethnic boasting. But now that your brother realizes he committed fraud, albeit unintentionally, he should repay any ill-gotten gains. This would be simple enough had he received scholarships intended for Native Americans. Instead, he got an unwarranted leg up when he applied to grad school, and he cannot travel back in time and withdraw his application. What he can do is make amends by contributing to organizations that offer education aid to Native Americans. A word on being ''part Indian.'' When invoking ethnicity, universities are -- or should be -- concerned not with genetics but with culture, with life as it's actually lived. If a DNA test had shown your brother to be 20 percent Cherokee, so what? He did not live as a Cherokee. His Cherokee forebears did not affect his behavior. And so he ought not check the Cherokee box on any application. THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 8-06-06: THE ETHICIST"
"With the National Weather Service predicting a very active Atlantic hurricane season (the forecast, issued in May, calls for 13 to 16 named storms, 8 to 10 of them becoming hurricanes and an alarming 4 to 6 becoming ''major'' hurricanes), two major hotel companies are relaxing their policies on refunds. At the 16 Marriott resorts in 9 Caribbean and Mexican beach sites, guests holding confirmed reservations from June 1 to Nov. 30 will be offered full refunds or one-category room upgrades at the same hotel for reservations in the next 12 months in the event that a hurricane closes the airport or the hotel before they can get there. There are also provisions for those whose vacations are interrupted by a hurricane. Catherine Leitner, the manager of international public relations for Marriott, said that 2005's severe hurricane season was ''very challenging,'' and that Marriott wanted ''to make travel easier for our guests who might be deferring booking until the season has past.'' She said that hurricane-season bookings for the Caribbean and Cancun remained strong, despite the weather's service predictions of another above normal hurricane season. The Westin Rio Mar Beach Golf Resort & Spa in Puerto Rico has also announced a hurricane-season protection policy. The Rest Assured hurricane guarantee policy covers all guests and is in effect whenever an official hurricane watch or warning is in place in the area. Guests holding confirmed reservations are offered a one-category upgrade if they reschedule within one calendar year. Guests already in the hotel will not be penalized for an early departure and any unused portion of a guest's deposit will be refunded. Additionally, they have the option of rebooking the balance of any reserved nights. But anyone wanting to leave because of mere bad weather will not be able to use either program. Both are only for a recognized hurricane, in which the sustained surface wind is 74 m.p.h. or greater. IN TRANSIT"
"As the peak of the tropical storm season approaches, President Bush sought to assure the nation on Monday that his administration had learned the lessons of Hurricane Katrina and was ready to handle another epic natural disaster. But Mr. Bush sent the message with pictures, not words. In a daylong visit to Miami that the White House said was intended to spotlight ''economic growth and hurricane preparedness,'' Mr. Bush visited the National Hurricane Center, chatting in front of the cameras with scientists who track tropical storms but not taking any questions. In remarks to reporters and in a separate speech at the Port of Miami, the president made no formal mention of storm preparations, leaving it to the new director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, R. David Paulison, and the White House press secretary, Tony Snow, to convey the readiness message. ''People have learned a lot from Katrina in time to draw the lessons,'' Mr. Snow told reporters after the president's speech at the port, which touched on the economy, port security, immigration, free trade and the Middle East. The White House says it has vastly improved its communications capabilities and has fortified its stockpile of supplies since Hurricane Katrina. The number of disaster assistance employees has doubled to 8,000 from 4,000, and the supply of ready-to-eat meals has increased by 300 percent, to 770 truckloads from 180 before the storm -- enough food, Mr. Paulison said, to feed a million people for a week. '''I want to make this country proud of FEMA again,'' he said, ''and I think we can do that.'' Aside from the visit to the hurricane center, Mr. Bush's trip to Miami included a breakfast with Cuban-American leaders and a half-hour boat tour of the port facilities aboard the Gannet, a coastal patrol boat flying the United States flag, a blue flag with the presidential seal and the black P.O.W.-M.I.A. flag. Mr. Bush was joined at the breakfast at a bakery in Little Havana by his brother Gov. Jeb Bush. Resentment lingers here and throughout the Gulf Coast over the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. The director Spike Lee, who has criticized the White House, has made a documentary on the storm, ''When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts.'' It is scheduled to be broadcast on HBO in late August, to coincide with the anniversary of the hurricane. Mr. Snow, the press secretary, said he did not know if the president would watch the film. But Mr. Paulison said he might. ''I probably would, yes, if I'm not doing hurricane stuff,'' Mr. Paulison said, adding: ''I'm taking this very seriously. I'm not taking it personally.'' Mr. Paulison, who replaced Michael D. Brown after Mr. Brown's resignation amid public complaints over his performance, said he had been briefing the president regularly on hurricane preparedness. The most recent session was last Friday, he said, and included members of the president's cabinet. ''One of the things I talked about was the chain of command and how we're going to share information,'' he said, adding that the president ''wants to make sure that information flow is going to move like it should move, and not end up like we did with Katrina last year.'' The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 31, but experts say 80 percent of hurricanes occur during the peak season, which begins in August. At the hurricane center, the president suggested that the busy season would conclude at the end of September, prompting the director, Max Mayfield, to gently correct him. ''Actually, mid-October,'' Mr. Mayfield said."
"THE rich are not like us. These days, they spend a lot more time watching the Weather Channel. Inspired by the weird profit opportunities that natural disasters create, hedge funds have been piling into reinsurance, the business of insuring insurers, scrambling to find ways to offer the kind of reinsurance in shortest supply these days: property catastrophe reinsurance, specifically for Florida and the Gulf of Mexico coastal region. According to the Reinsurance Association of America, $23 billion in capital has been raised for new or existing reinsurers since Hurricane Katrina. Hedge funds and private equity firms have led the way in the $7.3 billion that has been pumped into Bermuda start-up companies and $3.6 billion in ''sidecars'' -- special-purpose entities through which hedge funds give additional capital to existing reinsurers. That compares with no new start-ups or sidecars in the 12 months before Katrina, says Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association. That hedge funds are suddenly reinsurance experts should be no surprise. Insurers and reinsurers try to create models to determine potential claims they may have to pay, and the companies price premiums accordingly. Having just suffered a one-in-100 kind of year, the insurance industry can justify increasing premiums to the stratosphere. At the same time, the statistical probability of another one-in-100 kind of year happening moves further away, the insurers reason. Premiums for the Gulf Coast are up 100 to 200 percent since the storms of 2005. Reinsurance companies, staggering from their 2005 losses, need more capital, and hedge funds, in search of high returns, have a lot of it. Hedge funds are also seeking returns from investments that are not tied to movements in the stock and bond markets. That desire for such uncorrelated returns has become more pronounced in recent months as traditionally uncorrelated assets have moved in the same direction as the markets. That unnerved a lot of money managers. Their response? High-risk bets on Mother Nature. The opportunity is the potential for over-the-moon returns. The risk is a total wipe-out. Three storms in 2005 cost the insurance industry $80 billion, making 2005 the highest catastrophic-loss year in history, according to Standard & Poor's. Yet those storms also made 2006 a year of grand opportunity. The future will be no different. Hedge funds may be able to model, or predict, many things better than others. The weather is not likely to be one of them, but the bet does make sense: if hurricane season comes and goes without any epic disasters, the hedge funds in reinsurance will have made buckets of money on record high premiums. If disaster strikes, their capital -- either in catastrophe bonds, sidecars or newly minted reinsurance companies -- will be gone, paid out covering claims. ''It's not a short-term investment. It's a long-term investment,'' said Mr. Nutter. ''They can sell, but they can't just walk away.'' Big names have marched down to Bermuda, the reinsurance capital of the world, and the Cayman Islands. Citadel, the $12 billion hedge fund based in Chicago that led the charge into reinsurance, set up New Castle Re late last year. Magnetar, founded by a Citadel alumnus, Alec Litowitz, founded Pulsar Re earlier this year. Highfields Capital Management, based in Boston, along with XL Capital, set up a sidecar called Cyrus Reinsurance, and Eton Park Capital Management joined a number of private equity firms in forming Ariel Reinsurance, based in Bermuda, in December 2005. Bankers say funds are looking at the sector with an eager eye. More recently, smaller players have expressed interest as well. According to Standard & Poor's, hedge funds are the biggest buyers of catastrophe bonds. Invented in the wake of Hurricane Andrew, the bonds are issued by insurance or reinsurance companies. They pay 5 to 15 percent on the coupons, and they return on the principal if the maturity runs out without a catastrophic event. Roughly $1.8 billion of catastrophe bonds were issued in 2005. Through mid-August, $2.5 billion have been issued this year. Ten reinsurance companies have been founded since Katrina, as well as 10 sidecars. The sidecars allow hedge funds to give capital to an existing reinsurance company, limiting the funds' exposure to past policies and allowing the hedge funds to get more of the profits as long as there is no catastrophe. Existing reinsurers have raised $12 billion as well. But the outlook is not all clear skies. History is filled with examples of insurance gone bust. D. E. Shaw and Eton Park Capital management were among the largest investors in the recapitalization last year of the Bermuda reinsurer PXRE. The company issued $375 million of preferred shares. In February, the company announced that its previous estimate of potential hurricane-related losses was not enough, and said it had to add another $281 million to $311 million to the tally. The stock slid to $4.05, from $12.40. Fitch Ratings has maintained a negative watch, in part because of ''Fitch's belief that PXRE has limited financial flexibility going forward.'' The stock closed yesterday at $3.87. And not all hedge funds are racing in. One manager said this week that his fund had been looking closely at reinsurance. He said he had renovated a number of houses and had never had one come in close to budget. That led him to question whether reinsurance estimates of catastrophic losses would be any different. INSIDER"
"Frail elderly residents who were evacuated from nursing homes in the Gulf States suffered more than the vast majority of those who were not moved during last year's hurricanes, according to a report to be issued today by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. The report is based on site visits and interviews with administrators and staff members at 20 nursing homes in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, all with emergency plans that meet the requirements of federal and state law. But it found that the plans had rampant deficiencies, especially in ensuring the safe and comfortable evacuation of residents with complex needs. All 20 nursing home administrators agreed ''that an evacuation can cause physical and mental stress on nursing home residents and consequently is not necessarily the best course of action,'' according to the report, which was requested by Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, the ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging. Of the 20 nursing homes examined, of 2,526 nursing homes in the Gulf States, 13 evacuated residents before the storms reached landfall, and 7 did not move their residents. All struggled during the storms, and two of the seven were eventually forced to evacuate because of uncertain water and power supplies and inadequate police protection. The homes that evacuated ahead of the storms had the most serious problems, mostly related to transportation. Buses that the nursing homes had contracted for were not available, so residents had to travel in borrowed vehicles that often lacked air-conditioning or broke down along the way. Food and water had to be rationed on trips that took hours longer than expected. Medications, oxygen canisters and incontinence supplies were left behind. Staffing for the arduous trip was often inadequate. Some residents were dehydrated and suffered pressure sores or urinary tract infections from the travel conditions. The report is the first federal effort to examine in detail the effectiveness of federally mandated emergency preparedness plans in nursing homes. The plans were tested under the most harrowing of circumstances: four deadly hurricanes in less than a year. The report was not intended to focus on the life-and-death decision on whether to evacuate residents, and it did not examine the health records of the patients. But, its primary finding -- that perfectly legal emergency plans, which 94 percent of nursing homes have, are silent or vague on scores of pressing issues -- highlighted flaws in evacuation plans. Most of the gaps in the plans were in this area. Of the nursing homes surveyed, some had no guidelines on deciding whether to evacuate, no instructions about how much food and water to bring, no method for assigning staff members to make the trip, no procedures for transporting medications, no suggestions on alternate evacuation routes if highways were clogged, no arrangements with a host facility and no plans for how and when to return. The report also found that the nursing homes could not get the help they needed from local officials because there were no formal partnerships. ''The entire evacuation process is problematical,'' said Ruth Ann Dorrill, one of the analysts who worked on the report. ''They are left in the dark to feel their way or they rely on impromptu thinking.'' The report recommends that 25 ''core elements'' of emergency preparedness be included in plans for the nation's 16,125 nursing homes that receive Medicare or Medicaid money. The list was cobbled together from various sources before the site visits. Investigators studied nursing home guidelines for several states, including Florida, considered state-of-the-art in hurricane response. They consulted professional associations with expertise in long-term care, interviewed professors of emergency management and gerontology and reviewed scholarly articles on related subjects. In addition to requiring that plans include certain elements, the inspector general, Daniel R. Levinson, has also asked that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates nursing homes, encourage more collaboration with state and local emergency officials. Administrators at many of the 20 homes that were visited complained about not getting the help they needed from those officials. The help they got, the nursing home administrators said, came from sister facilities, family members and churches or schools. Many academics and advocates for nursing home residents say the federal government must be more explicit about the components of an acceptable plan, not merely mandate that there be one. ''It is absolutely essential that a system be put in place up front, and the government must take the leadership role in that,'' said Alice H. Hedt, executive director of the National Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform. ''It is too much to expect that nursing home operators can make all these difficult decisions in a very short time and with a lot of stressors.'' In a written response to the report, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he concurred with the findings, and was already exploring how the regulations could be strengthened."
"Judah Hertz, a Santa Monica, Calif., real estate investor, has sometimes been compared to Larry Silverstein, the New York developer who signed a long-term lease for the World Trade Center just six weeks before the twin towers were destroyed by terrorists. Mr. Hertz entered the downtown office market here in late 2002, buying four prime buildings -- one-fourth of the inventory -- in the three years before Hurricane Katrina. Now some people associated with another outsider, the hotel magnate Laurence S. Geller, are calling Mr. Hertz a spoiler, saying he is threatening to undermine the only large downtown commercial development project that has been proposed here since the storm. Mr. Hertz said he had been unfairly cast as a villain by Mr. Geller's allies. In contrast to this city's devastated residential neighborhoods, the compact central business district along Poydras Street has mostly managed to rebound from the hurricane, despite water and wind damage. But three buildings in one pocket near the Superdome were hit by severe gusts, maybe even a minitornado -- the 1,184-room Hyatt Regency, the 26-story Dominion Tower office building and the New Orleans Shopping Centre -- and they have not reopened. In May, Mr. Geller, the chief executive of Strategic Hotels and Resorts, the real estate investment trust that has owned the Hyatt Regency since 1997, announced a plan to rehabilitate the hotel as part of an ambitious 20-acre project that would include a six-block park, public buildings and a jazz center. As originally envisioned, the park would replace the long-troubled mall, and municipal offices would move from the damaged City Hall to the 1989 Dominion Tower, the last office building to rise downtown. But the mall, the office tower and 3,000 parking spaces belong to the Hertz Investment Group. And Mr. Hertz, the chief executive, said he never had a written agreement to sell them to Strategic -- a fact not disclosed when the project was made public. Mr. Hertz said this was like claiming to buy a corporate office building and then accusing the owner of being a bad company for not selling it. ''I know it sounds crazy, but that's just what happened to me.'' As is usually the case, the dispute hinges on price. ''He's got something he thinks is more valuable than someone else does,'' said Mr. Geller, who has likened his $725 million project to the acclaimed Millennium Park in Chicago, where Strategic is based. ''He wants a high price -- and he wants his money now, far exceeding its current value.'' Strategic's broker, Michael J. Siegel, an executive vice president of Corporate Realty, a regional company, estimated the combined value of the shopping center, the office building and the garage at no more than $50 million, well below Mr. Hertz's valuation of more than $70 million. But Mr. Hertz said that rather than sell Dominion Tower, he intends to rent it to the city or find other office tenants. Mr. Hertz said Mr. Geller may just be stalling. ''I'm very surprised they think now that I was asking too much money,'' Mr. Hertz said. ''I believe he hasn't finished his deal yet. If it's not done, what's the point of making a deal with me at any price?'' New Orleans has experienced plenty of failed real estate projects over the years, and Mr. Geller's plan to create a tourist magnet, which he said would generate thousands of jobs and pump billions of dollars into the city's struggling economy, has met with some skepticism. He has committed $200 million of his company's money and insurance proceeds to the project, but acknowledges that even with capital from a variety of other sources, a $225 million gap remains. Not incidentally, the project would also improve the prospects for the Hyatt Regency, which was fighting for customers even before the hurricane because it is not near the French Quarter or the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Strategic owns 19 other luxury hotels. Mr. Hertz also seemed to face many challenges when he began buying office buildings along Poydras Street, beginning with the 27-story Poydras Center. The market, though stable, did not seem to offer much opportunity for growth, causing real estate specialists to wonder, ''What does he know that we don't know?'' said Greg Riera, a vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle, which manages two buildings on Poydras. ''But the price was right.'' Just before Katrina, Mr. Hertz bought the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company Building, a 36-story tower at 909 Poydras (one of the city's two best addresses) and the 32-story Texaco Center at 400 Poydras -- from Equity Office Properties Trust, the large Chicago REIT. Equity Office, which still owns one complex in suburban Metairie, has been streamlining its portfolio and getting out of markets without robust job growth. Richard D. Kincaid, Equity Office's chief executive, said that when his company bought the two buildings on Poydras Street in 1997, New Orleans was still a big regional oil and gas hub. ''But then company after company exited and consolidated in Houston,'' Mr. Kincaid said. ''There was not a lot of industry other than tourism and that doesn't generate a lot of jobs.'' Equity Office sold the buildings for less than it paid for them, Mr. Kincaid said. Mr. Hertz's leasing agent, Bryan Burns III, a senior vice president at Transwestern Commercial Services, described his client as a long-term investor. ''He's an entrepreneurial opportunistic buyer,'' Mr. Burns said. ''His horizon is not short term. He felt confident there would be substantial value enhancements.'' In the aftermath of the storm, the commercial office market has turned out to be one of the few bright spots in the city's economy. In the prime downtown buildings, occupancy stands at 91.2 percent, up from 86.8 percent before the hurricane, according to Equity Office. Rents are beginning to rise and landlords are regaining the upper hand in the marketplace, although the higher rents are being offset by increased operating costs, especially for insurance, said Mr. Siegel of Corporate Realty. ''Our office market has been flat for the past two decades,'' he said. ''If somebody had told me in October or November last year that we would have been at this point, I wouldn't have believed it.'' Much of that gain can be attributed to the closing of the 487,000-square-foot Dominion Tower, which shrank the prime office market to 8.8 million square feet. Four second-tier buildings are also not expected to reopen. But most of the city's major employers -- including Shell Oil, Entergy and Dominion -- returned, though usually with fewer workers. One downtown company, Chevron, is moving to the suburbs. Some of the demand downtown has come from government agencies, construction companies and engineering firms responding to the storm, but space is being leased at a slower pace than it was initially, said Brian Rourke, a broker with Latter & Blum, a local company. Ryan W. Sweet, an associate economist at Moody's economy.com, said Katrina had not generated the number of recovery-associated jobs expected after a hurricane because so much of the local population was displaced and may never return. The city's plight makes it all the more important to get the so-called Hyatt Jazz District built, with or without Mr. Hertz's cooperation, Mr. Geller said. He said the project's master planner, Thom Mayne, a Pritzker-Prize-winning architect, is working on new blueprints to reorient the project so that it does not have a dead mall in the middle of it. ''I will not let the city down because of one man's recalcitrance and belief that an asset is worth more than it's worth,'' Mr. Geller said. Square Feet"
"Rising ocean temperatures linked by some studies to tropical storms are very likely a result of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions, according to new research. The lead author of the new study, Benjamin D. Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory of the Energy Department, said the findings suggested that further warming would probably make hurricanes stronger in coming decades. But while environmentalists and some researchers have asserted that storms like Hurricane Katrina were already measurably stronger because of warming caused by humans, Dr. Santer said his study did not address that issue. The study was published online yesterday by The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers compared a century of observed temperature changes with those produced in more than 80 computer simulations of how oceans respond to natural and human influences on the climate. The simulations were generated on 22 different computer models at 15 different research centers. The simulations correctly mimicked the cooling caused by plumes from volcanic eruptions, which temporarily block the sun. At the same time, the authors said, the only warming influence that could explain the changes in the oceans was the buildup of heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases in the air. Earlier studies concluded that greenhouse gases from human activities were warming the oceans, but this analysis was the first to examine thoroughly trends in particular tropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that serve as nurseries for the destructive storms. Several climate experts said that while debate persisted about the role of warming in pumping up hurricanes, there was little doubt about the long-term trend should warming continue as projected. ''Even under modest scenarios for emissions, we're talking about sea surface temperature changes in these regions of a couple of degrees,'' Dr. Santer said. ''That's much larger than anything we've already experienced, and that is worrying.''"
"A year after the Oregon National Guard deployed troops to Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Oregon is finally expected to be reimbursed the full amount it paid its soldiers for the weeks they worked, emergency management officials in Louisiana said. For months, Guard officials in Oregon have sought $2.7 million above the $3 million they say the federal government has paid for the 2,100 Oregon troops who helped with hurricane relief. The discrepancy arose because Oregon pays some soldiers more than the federal government has agreed to reimburse those who respond to natural disasters. Mark Merritt, a consultant with the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in Louisiana, which is helping coordinate federal reimbursements, said late Wednesday that Oregon's request had initially been rejected because officials thought the additional money was a ''disaster bonus,'' not a stipend required under Oregon law. Mr. Merritt said officials still must formally review an itemized explanation of the reimbursement request that Oregon sent to Louisiana on Monday. A spokeswoman for the Oregon National Guard, Kay Fristad, said Oregon was told this week: ''The expenses appear eligible. That's all they've told us. We have no promise of payment at this point.'' Mr. Merritt said he knew of no other state that had such a policy or had made such a claim, ''and I've been doing this for 14 years.'' Guard units that went to the Gulf Coast typically remained under the authority of their state's governor. Because they were responding to a federal disaster, they were under a federal status called Title 32 and states have been reimbursed by the Department of Defense at a fixed rate. But since the 1990's, Oregon has assured lower-ranking Guard members who respond to natural disasters that they will be paid substantially higher, as if they were serving ''state active duty.'' The lowest-ranking Oregon Guard members would receive $169.72 a day under state active duty, according to the Oregon National Guard. Under Title 32, the soldier would receive $41.17 each day."
"A powerful hurricane churned up the western coast of Mexico on Thursday, raking coastal towns and tourist resorts with high winds and heavy rains but staying far enough offshore to prevent major damage. By evening, no deaths or injuries had been reported as a result of the storm. United States forecasters predicted Hurricane John would continue to lash the coast on its way toward the tip of the Baja California peninsula, where it was expected to make landfall on Friday morning. At 5 p.m., the forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm had weakened with top winds of 105 miles per hour, though they warned it could strengthen again. The eye was 240 miles southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. The authorities in the tourist areas of Los Cabos and La Paz were evacuating about 15,000 people from the coast to schools, churches and other sturdy buildings inland, while tourist hotels designated as hurricane shelters were herding guests into fortified ballrooms to weather the storm. ''Faced with this threat, nothing is enough,'' said José Gajón de la Toba, the director of Civil Protection for Baja California. ''But we are doing everything we can.'' Hundreds of foreign tourists raced to the Los Cabos airport to escape the storm, forming long lines for the last flights. The storm is expected to slam into the strip of resorts and golf courses between the towns of Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo. For much of the day, a hurricane warning was in effect for a 300-mile stretch of the Mexican Pacific coast, from the port of Lázaro Cárdenas north to Cabo Corrientes, which forms the southern tip of the bay at Puerto Vallarta. Puerto Vallarta experienced a clear morning but skies turned threatening in the afternoon, and, as evening fell, heavy rains came and officials monitored dangerously swollen rivers, the authorities said. In San Blas, the main coastal town in Nayarit state north of Puerto Vallarta, businesses closed, the port was shut and residents covered windows and barred doors, officials said. Four years ago another hurricane destroyed most of the town. ''The people already know what to do, and we hope there is no bad luck,'' said Jaime Mendoza, the chief of public security in the town. To the south, the state of Colima appeared to have escaped the brunt of the storm. City officials in Manzanillo said they had moderate rains and high winds, but not enough to damage buildings. Acapulco and Ixtapa, the tourist towns in neighboring Guerrero state, also came through the storm with only moderate flooding, news reports said. Most of the concern centered on the region of Los Cabos, the tip of the Baja Peninsula that has grown into a major resort center in recent years. Port authorities rushed to prepare for the storm, while soldiers, marines and police officers forced residents near the coast to go to shelters. The hurricane had reached Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale on Wednesday, but lost force on Thursday. It was forecast to veer west out into the Pacific Ocean after touching Baja California on Friday, and to deluge parts of Mexico's western coast with 6 to 10 inches of rain, meteorologists said."
"Tropical Storm Ernesto made landfall late Thursday as it drenched the coastline of the Carolinas, hovering just below hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of nearly 70 miles per hour. Officials in Brunswick County, the southernmost coastal county of North Carolina, reported sporadic flooding and warned of possible tornadoes, and the governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the storm. But residents along the coast said they were mostly just relieved that the storm would be well clear before Labor Day weekend. For the most part on Thursday, coastal residents of North and South Carolina did little more than pick up anything that might be blown away. Mac McLane, the general manager of the El Dorado hotel in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said he had received only two cancellations for the weekend and was fully booked for Saturday night. ''Killing the holiday weekend, that's everyone's big concern,'' Mr. McLane said. ''Labor Day is like our last big hurrah. A storm like this blowing in could just kill us.'' Danielle Izzo of Danbury, Conn., was buying a sweatshirt at a souvenir shop to fend off the chilly weather. ''I think it's actually kind of fun,'' Ms. Izzo said. ''We live in the north; we get blizzards. My biggest thrill is seeing the Weather Channel people down there because I watch them all the time.'' Sean Ream, 32, of Myrtle Beach, also shrugged off the storm. ''The pressure's not low enough for it to do anything,'' Mr. Ream said. ''All my friends are out surfing.''"
"What a difference a few weeks can make. As OPEC ministers prepare to meet here Monday, the question on their minds is not how high oil prices will rise, but how far they may drop. Crude oil prices have fallen more than $10 a barrel in the last month, driving down the retail price of gasoline and providing some relief for consumers. While energy prices remain high, they have not risen to the heights that many analysts had feared, in part because of a light hurricane season this summer, the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, and the fact that the United Nations has not imposed sanctions on Iran. While there is no sense of urgency about oil price increases, some members of OPEC are beginning to express anxiety about further price declines. Nigeria's representative, Edmund Daukoru, who currently holds the rotating presidency of the group, said Sunday, ''I am very concerned about the drop in prices. We do not know how much further they can go and we need to review that in depth.'' Others are more optimistic. Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, said on Saturday, ''Demand is very well satisfied -- you read the numbers, you see the inventories rising. I think the market is very comfortable and very well supplied. We are very happy with the situation.'' Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries account for 40 percent of the world's oil exports, and they have been pumping at maximum capacity over the last year in an effort to drive down prices. It is unlikely that the OPEC ministers will alter at Monday's meeting their current policy of keeping markets well supplied with oil. But some of them are beginning to think about whether to cut output next year, an effort that would be aimed at keeping prices from declining further. One consideration is that a sharp infusion of new energy supplies is expected to hit the market from producers outside of OPEC. The biggest increases are likely to come from African producers like Angola, from Russia and from Caspian nations, and from unconventional sources of fuel like ethanol, biodiesel or liquefied gases. ''OPEC will have to cut supplies at some point, it's a no-brainer, but not until new supplies come on the market,'' said Deborah White, an energy economist with Société Générale in Paris. ''There were forecasts for substantial non-OPEC supplies for 2005, but everything is running late and behind schedule.'' She added, ''The only thing OPEC is capable of doing is setting a floor for prices, but not a ceiling.'' Like most oil producers, OPEC's 11 members have struggled to catch up with rising demand in the last two years. For some, production has dropped because of armed conflicts, like those in Iraq and Nigeria; for others, lower production has stemmed from restrictive policies at home, as in Iran and Venezuela. Still, oil prices have dropped. Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Friday to their lowest level in five months. The light, sweet crude contract for October delivery closed at $66.25 a barrel. Oil markets seem to have evaded predictions that the price would rise to $100 a barrel, but they remain at the mercy of sudden production interruptions. The hurricane season is only at the halfway point, the United Nations may still agree to impose sanctions on Iran, and Nigeria's output remains crimped by violence in the Niger Delta region. Oil traders have recently been encouraged by signs that the physical market -- actual barrels that are traded -- is oversupplied, helping bolster fuel stockpiles in the United States to higher-than-average levels and helping to push prices down. Commercial stockpiles of crude oil and products are 6 percent higher today than they were last summer. Greg Priddy, an analyst in Eurasia Group's Global Energy practice, said: ''We've had two sets of factors moving in opposite directions: fundamentals are pulling the market down a little. But the political issues like Iran and Nigeria are still around.'' At a meeting in June 2005, OPEC set an official quota of 28 million barrels a day for all its members except Iraq, which has not had a production target for years. Since then, the group has met five times without changing its output goal. OPEC members are currently pumping about 27.8 million barrels of crude oil a day, 200,000 barrels less than the quota. With Iraq, the group's output is closer to 30 million barrels a day. As a group, OPEC failed to anticipate the rapid growth in consumption from China and the United States, an oversight that contributed to a sharp increase in energy prices. Production disruptions in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, have increased fears of supply shortfalls in the global energy markets. But just a few weeks ago, oil analysts and forecasters were issuing bleaker predictions still. The Atlantic hurricane season was expected to be as bad as last year's; Iran, a top oil producer, was defying the United Nations over a nuclear research program; and BP was forced to shut down a major field in Alaska because of a pipeline leak. Then there was a monthlong war in the Middle East, which sent oil prices spinning to their highest levels in three decades, almost $80. Gasoline prices soared in the middle of the driving summer season. But just as suddenly, the bubble seems to have deflated. So far, there has been only one major hurricane, compared with six at the same time last year, including Hurricane Katrina, which flooded New Orleans and shattered the offshore oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. The war between Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon stopped last month without escalating into a regional conflict. And the prospect of sanctions against Iran seemed further off Sunday, as Iranian and European negotiators appeared to make some headway in their discussions, which are also taking place here. Of course, oil prices have tripled in the last five years. But when adjusted for inflation, prices have yet to reach records from the 1970's, which would translate into more than $90 a barrel in today's prices. Regular gasoline averaged $2.68 a gallon last week, an 11 percent drop from last month, according to the Energy Department."
"Hurricane John, one of the strongest storms to threaten the Baja California peninsula in years, crashed ashore on the eastern tip of the peninsula late Friday and headed toward La Paz, the state capital. The eye of the storm whirled onto land with sustained winds of 110 miles per hour about 20 miles northeast of San Jose Del Cabo and moved north at 9 miles per hour toward La Paz, forecasters said. Officials in the resort towns of San Jose Del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas breathed a sigh of relief, as it appeared that the luxury hotels and golf courses along the coast would escape a frontal assault, though streets flooded and high winds toppled signs and sent metal gates flying. As the storm advanced on the area earlier Friday and on Thursday, residents boarded up their houses and tourists gathered in hotel ballrooms to wait it out. Most residents were determinedly calm, recalling Hurricane Juliette in 2001, which hovered over Cabo San Lucas, wedged between the ocean and the desert, for a couple of days. But Juliette was a Category 1 storm. John, though weaker than it had been Thursday night, was a Category 2 hurricane on Friday evening. Earlier in the day it shifted east, said the National Hurricane Center in Miami, and Cabo San Lucas was largely spared. The hurricane center called John a ''dangerous'' storm, warning that it could drop up to 15 inches of rain in some places and could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. In Los Cabos, on the southern tip of the peninsula, and in La Paz, officials evacuated as many as 15,000 people from ramshackle housing as the storm neared. Through rain, soldiers in areas at risk forcibly removed people who had refused to leave. Gilberto Amador, a taxi driver here, said during the day that he boarded up his windows the night before. ''I was out hammering at midnight,'' he said. Mr. Amador, one of the few people in this resort who was born here, said he had grown up hearing stories of a storm in the 1950's that had swept away the houses of local fishermen. Many tourists tried to leave Los Cabos on Thursday, forming long lines at the airport. Others, unable to get flights, decided to wait out the storm. Officials estimated as many as 10,000 tourists were in the region. Nick St John, 19, of Sarasota, Fla., spent the afternoon surfing as the waves grew more fierce. ''Right now, it's awesome out there,'' he said. ''It's the best time to go out.'' At the Villa del Palmar Beach Resort, Jorge E. Avilés, the general manager, monitored weather reports as he reviewed emergency plans. On Thursday, he had moved guests out of rooms facing the ocean, which would be most exposed to the hurricane's winds. ''Nobody cares about the ocean view today,'' he said."
"Standing just blocks from ground zero, C. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, backed away yesterday from his heavily criticized remarks about the slow pace of rebuilding at the World Trade Center site. But he declined to say he was sorry. Mr. Nagin, who is visiting New York, was asked at a news conference at Tribeca Cinemas if he wanted to make an explicit apology. ''I think I've already kind of been through that,'' he replied. But he added: ''I tell you what I will never do again is refer to that site as a hole. It's a sacred site that is presently in an undeveloped state. I'll leave it at that.'' Last Sunday, on a segment of CBS's ''60 Minutes,'' a reporter asked Mayor Nagin why so little debris, including long-abandoned automobiles, had been cleared from New Orleans neighborhoods devastated by flooding after Hurricane Katrina a year ago. Mr. Nagin replied sharply: ''That's all right. You guys in New York can't get a hole in the ground fixed and it's five years later. So let's be fair.'' His remarks were widely criticized as flippant and insensitive. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who joined Mr. Nagin at the news conference, said that the mayor's critics should keep the words in perspective. ''To those in the media that would concentrate on the intemperate remarks he made,'' Mr. Sharpton said, ''the people of New Orleans have gotten over the media calling New Orleans citizens refugees. So we all have a lot to get over what was said.'' In prepared remarks, Mayor Nagin said: ''New Orleanians and New Yorkers understand what tragedy is all about. We understand the difficulties in trying to recover from the tragedies.'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did not attend the news conference. Dennis M. Walcott, a deputy mayor who was there instead, said Mr. Bloomberg was attending the funeral of Firefighter Michael C. Reilly, who died last Sunday fighting a fire at a 99-cent store in the Bronx. Mr. Walcott said he had spoken with Mr. Bloomberg before the news conference. ''There is no issue between Mayor Nagin and our city and our mayor,'' Mr. Walcott said. However, visitors at ground zero, where more than 2,700 people died during the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, condemned Mr. Nagin's lack of apology when they were told what he had said at the news conference. John Foley, 38, a reinsurance broker from Glen Cove, N.Y., who works on Wall Street, said Mr. Nagin ''owes the people of New York and the people of the United States an apology.'' ''He's shown very poor judgment,'' Mr. Foley added. Glancing down at his 4-year-old daughter, Katy, born on Sept. 8, 2001, he said, ''She's the reason I wasn't at the World Trade Center.'' Matt Berkowitz, 26, a television producer from Philadelphia, said: ''It's just a political thing, not wanting to apologize and go back on his words. But what he said showed a lack of compassion.'' And Mark Schwaller, 51, a kitchen remodeler from Genesee Depot, Wis., said Mayor Nagin ''should be embarrassed.'' Ceeon Quiett, a spokeswoman for Mr. Nagin, said the mayor planned to visit ground zero during his visit. Accompanied by New Orleans economic development officials, Mr. Nagin is attending a two-day conference at Tribeca Cinemas to help attract business investment to New Orleans. Mayor Nagin, dapper in a dark suit, white shirt and yellow tie, seemed to suspect that the gathered reporters might not all be interested in the subject of economic development. Moments after getting up to speak, he said: ''We're going live, right? So I'm going to watch myself.'' He smiled, smoothed his tie, and said, ''I'm going to stick to my script this morning.'' One reporter, saying that ground zero really was ''a hole in the ground,'' asked, ''So what's so wrong about calling it what it is?'' A jocular Mr. Sharpton leaned toward the microphones and said, pointing first at the reporter, ''He said it,'' and then at Mr. Nagin, ''but he didn't!''"
"WHEN Lori and Jeff Cummings and their two teenage sons move into their new house in Fort Deposit, Ala., next week, high winds, escalating energy prices and concerns about mold and termites will not be among their worries. Their 6,000-square-foot neo-Classical-style house was framed with insulating concrete forms, known as I.C.F.'s, an alternative to traditional wood-frame or stick construction that has become increasingly popular as a way to build a strong, energy-efficient house. Two years ago Ms. Cummings, 43, a former consumer reporter for a PBS affiliate in Alabama, had just started researching eco-friendly houses when Hurricane Ivan tore through the state. Ms. Cummings's house in Greenville only lost power for a week, but her sister-in-law's house four miles away sustained $30,000 of damage, and nearby subdivisions were wiped out. After that, she said, ''I decided to look for not only energy efficiency but something that would withstand hurricane force winds.'' The Cummingses are among hundreds of thousands of Americans who have embraced the use of concrete in residential building in recent years. According to the Portland Cement Association, a trade group in Skokie, Ill., concrete homes made up 16.3 percent of the market for new construction in 2004, the last year for which data was available, compared with 3 percent in 1993. The use of I.C.F.'s -- interlocking blocks made of concrete sandwiched between rigid foam panels and reinforced with steel bars -- has risen 73 percent over the past five years, said Joseph Lyman, the executive director of the Insulating Concrete Form Association, a national trade group based in Glenview, Ill. If concrete houses do not seem to be transforming the landscape, it may be because it's hard to tell they are there. Ms. Cummings's house is finished in brick. ''You could use stucco or acrylic finish, or you could use stone or brick; you could use vinyl siding, clapboard, almost anything you could use on a traditional system,'' Mr. Lyman said. I.C.F.'s, which like other new concrete building systems first became popular in Europe some 30 years ago but caught on in the United States in the 1990's, offer significant protection from the elements. They are fire resistant and capable of withstanding 180- to 200-mile-an-hour winds, said Thad Tobaben, general manager of Tritex I.C.F. Products in Omaha, the block manufacturer Ms. Cummings used. (They also reduce sound to a whisper when used to frame interior as well as exterior walls, as they were in the Cummingses' house; Ms. Cummings said she was looking forward to no longer having to leave home when her husband plays the harmonica or when her sons practice drums and guitar.) Another relatively new concrete technology, a process called shotcrete, creates walls, floors and roofs with concrete shot from a pressurized feeder over foam panels and wire mesh. Michael Stone, a writer in Water Mill, N.Y., built a Mediterranean-style villa there using shotcrete at the suggestion of his contractor, Nicholas Alimanestianu of the Southampton Building Corporation. ''The idea of solid construction appealed to me,'' said Mr. Stone, whose 4,000-square-foot fortress-like house was completed in June. ''It has to do with the sense of permanence, and resistance against the weather.'' Concrete homes can also be built with a cast-in-place method using removable, temporary forms; precast or poured-on-site tilt-up concrete panels; or blocks of aerated concrete held together with mortar. Mr. Alimanestianu, who has been building high-end wood-frame houses in the Hamptons for more than 20 years, started exploring concrete methods four years ago. ''It's a much better way to go if you want security against hurricanes, termites, rot, aging -- all the things that go with wood construction,'' he said. The material has become more popular with people building homes in the Southeast and in coastal regions, including those rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. ''Those who are staying want a home they can rely on, and a concrete home is clearly a choice that a lot of people are looking into,'' said Jeremy Bertrand, the executive director of the Building Systems Councils for the National Association of Home Builders. But it is energy efficiency, not fears of high winds, that is the primary reason for concrete's increase in popularity, Mr. Lyman and others who work with the material said, particularly in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Minnesota, the states where it is most widely used. I.C.F.'s create ''a system that has virtually no air infiltration,'' Mr. Lyman said, resulting in tremendous energy efficiency. Houses with exterior insulating concrete form walls require 44 percent less energy to heat and 32 percent less energy to cool than comparable frame houses, the Insulating Concrete Form Association says. ''These homes are able to meet a lot of the green building guidelines and standards that are coming about,'' Mr. Bertrand said. A year and a half ago Matt Grivner, 33, a pilot, and his wife, Kimberly, 32, a registered nurse, built a house with I.C.F.'s in Woodbury, Conn. They spent just under $600,000 on the 3,000-square-foot fiber cement sided farmhouse, slightly more than if the shell had been wood. (According to the National Association of Home Builders, the cost of a house built with I.C.F.'s is 1 percent to 8 percent more than a wood-frame house.) ''You spend more for the house but less for heating and mechanical systems,'' said Jim Eggert, a contractor in Branford, Conn., who built the Grivners' house and has been using I.C.F.'s since 1996. The Grivners needed only one air-conditioning condenser to cool their home. ''It tends to stay cooler longer during the day,'' Mr. Grivner said, comparing the feeling to a basement without the dampness. In winter the thick walls are draft-free and retain the heat. But while energy efficiency is important to many builders, contractors say that growing concerns about hurricanes and other weather-related disasters are also feeding interest in concrete, particularly as insurers become more cautious. Mr. Grivner and other homeowners said they received a discount on their homeowners' insurance for masonry construction. David Hammarstrom, a spokesman for MetLife, said that a reinforced concrete shell is one of many things his company considers when underwriting a house. ''They would get preferential treatment over a nonreinforced home, other things being equal,'' Mr. Hammarstrom said, although he declined to offer specifics. But Mike Siemienas, a spokesman for Allstate, which earlier this year declined to renew policies for thousands of customers in catastrophe-prone areas, said that while having a reinforced concrete home could be beneficial in the insurance equation, it was not a guarantee of coverage. ''There is still a chance the roof could be blown off,'' Mr. Siemienas said. ''The structure may still be standing after the storm but there could still be significant damage to the home.'' Still, Chuck Vance, the manager of the Fortified program at the Institute for Business & Home Safety, an insurance trade association based in Tampa, Fla., whose mission is reducing property loss caused by natural disasters, said that reinforced concrete homes ''have a very good record being able to withstand heavy winds associated with hurricanes'' compared with stick construction. And in studies done by the Wind Science and Engineering Research Center at Texas Tech University to determine the suitability of I.C.F.'s for above-ground storm shelters, wood stud ''missiles'' fired under tornado conditions were unable to penetrate I.C.F.'s. (Although Ernst Kiesling, the civil engineering professor who conducted the study, pointed out the continued ''difficulty of protecting windows and doors and roofs.'') Jon Rufty, 52, a builder based in Cary, N.C., uses one of the steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete homes he built on Topsail Island as a beach house. ''In a strong wind down at the coast, a lot of times with a frame construction house you can actually feel it sway a little bit,'' Mr. Rufty said. ''In a concrete home, needless to say, it is just solid.''"
"Add this to the list of reasons real estate is cooling off in some of the hottest markets: soaring insurance costs. Along the coast from Texas to Maine, owners of apartments and houses are being charged huge increases in premiums -- in some cases more than 10 times what they paid last year. The price rises are part of continuing fallout from Hurricane Katrina. Insurance companies paid more than $57 billion to cover damage from the hurricane and three others last year. And faced with predictions of severe storms for years to come, they are charging higher premiums to try to insulate themselves from future financial damage. The price increases far exceed anything in the past, and consumer advocates accuse the insurers of price-gouging. But Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said, ''The escalation in the cost of insurance is a reflection of increased risk'' from future storms. The ripple effects are also being felt farther north, beyond the once-hot coastal markets in the South. Coverage costs have tripled in some cases on Cape Cod and have risen as much as 50 percent on Long Island. Real estate experts say the rising premiums have contributed to the fall in housing prices, which are also under pressure from rising mortgage rates and the inevitable cooling of a too-hot market. ''In the South, the insurance issue is having a meaningful negative impact on sales,'' said David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. ''It is less meaningful up the coast to the north, but insurance is definitely becoming a factor in sales there, too.'' The shock of higher premiums is being felt by people like Walker and Shirley Totty, who have lived for 11 years in a 36-unit building here overlooking a white-sand beach on Alabama's small stretch of Gulf Coast. Mr. Totty, a retired manager of an auto repair and tire store in Birmingham, said the insurance premium for his building had jumped more than 12-fold, to $429,182 annually this year, from $34,790 in 2005. His share of the new bill -- about $11,000, up from about $900 -- has created such a hole in his budget that he is trying to sell his condominium and move inland. ''If I stay here, I'm going to run out of money,'' he said. Not long ago, finding a buyer for an apartment on the Alabama coast, a popular area for second-home buyers, would have been easy. But Mr. Totty's property has been on the market at a price of $565,000 for three months and no one has even inquired about it. ''The market is full of fear because of the storms,'' said Larry Powell, a broker at Meyer Real Estate in Gulf Shores, Ala. ''When you start seeing the cost of insurance in the range we're seeing it, you start thinking: Is it worth it? Can I afford to be here?'' Farther north, insurance coverage costs have not risen so sharply, but coastal homeowners are paying for heightened hurricane fears another way. On Cape Cod and Long Island, for example, owners have been forced to take on a much larger share of the risk of hurricane damage through higher deductibles. Mike Chapman, sales chief in Boston for Hub International, a national insurance broker, said that premiums on many condos on Cape Cod had doubled or tripled. Deductibles, in some cases, jumped to $125,000 from $5,000. On Long Island, Alex M. Seaman, another Hub International broker, said prices were up 20 percent to 50 percent. For one condo building, he said, the annual premium had risen to $175,000, from $120,000, and the deductible increased to $50,000, from $2,500. The higher insurance rates are also scaring off real estate investors, who generally do not plan to live in the apartments they buy. Typically, their strategy has been to rent the apartment for most of the year to cover mortgage payments and other fees, perhaps use it for a few weeks of vacation, and then sell it for much more than they paid. But the higher insurance costs have forced investors to redo their back-of-the-envelope math. And for many, the numbers are not adding up. ''People were buying condos with the idea of 'cash flowing' them -- having them pay for themselves with rental income,'' said Kay Stephenson, a broker at Crump Insurance Services in Atlanta. ''But now you have the cost of insurance and you have to increase the cost of the rental, and people are just not able to do it.'' Here in Orange Beach, a resort community with a condominium-lined beach, and in its almost identical twin, Gulf Shores -- both directly in the path of Hurricane Ivan in 2004 -- it is impossible to tease out precisely the degree to which insurance costs have hurt sales. But they have clearly been a factor. Condo sales are down 71 percent in Orange Beach during the first eight months of 2006 compared with the similar period last year, down 58 percent in Gulf Shores and down 84 percent in Fort Morgan, a smaller beach town just west of Gulf Shores. That compares with a 10.5 percent drop in condo sales around the country and about the same in the South as a whole, according to the National Association of Realtors. In Florida, sales of individual homes have declined an average of 33 percent, and condominium sales are down 37 percent statewide. But in the cities of Daytona Beach and Naples, condo sales are down more than 50 percent from last year. ''Insurance is killing us,'' said Michael Dooley, president of the Florida Association of Realtors. The effect of higher premiums ''has stepped up big time in the last few months.'' Mr. Dooley, the managing broker of Illustrated Properties in Hobe Sound, Fla., north of West Palm Beach, said one customer for a $1 million home on a canal near the beach ''walked away from the transaction and a $6,000 deposit when he found out what the insurance premium was going to be.'' The policy on Mr. Dooley's own waterfront home is up for renewal in February and his agent has told him the annual premium will be $10,600, compared with $5,500 last year. Given the long-term predictions of more and stronger hurricanes in coming decades -- based on cyclical patterns of ocean currents and, to some extent, global warming -- many insurance experts say they expect the new, higher rates to become the norm, rather than the exception, even if no major storms occur in the next year or two. ''I don't think the price is going to go come down quickly, no matter what happens,'' said Ed Kiessling, a senior executive at Frank Crystal & Company, a national insurance brokerage firm based in New York. There are no real alternatives for homeowners. Policy makers in Washington have begun debating whether the federal government should share some of the burden of coverage for many kinds of disasters -- not just hurricanes, but also tornadoes, wildfires and earthquakes -- as it does now in terrorist attacks. But the industry is divided on whether to cede some of its risks and potential profits to the government, and Congress is far from voting on the issue, industry specialists say. In Alabama and other areas in hurricane territory, some condo owners have discussed pooling their money to insure themselves, but have found that raising such a fund can be even more painful than paying high premiums to insurers. While premiums on the houses of individuals have doubled or tripled, real estate and insurance people say the cost of coverage has risen much more steeply for condominium complexes, in part because their value routinely runs to the tens of millions of dollars and they represent a much higher concentration of risk for insurers than single-family homes do. Daniel Craven, a lawyer who represents more than 100 condo owners' associations in Orange Beach and Gulf Shores, said that premium increases were steepest on homes and apartment buildings built with wood, because they typically suffer the greatest damage in a storm. For concrete and steel buildings set on deep pilings, with lower floors used only for parking, insurance rates have generally doubled or tripled at the Alabama beaches. The last time homeowners experienced so steep a jump in insurance prices was in 1992, when premiums tripled or quadrupled in Florida after Hurricane Andrew tore across the state south of Miami. To win the approval of regulators for such increases in Florida and a few other states, the insurers told regulators that they had taken steps to avoid similar price shocks in the future, according to J. Robert Hunter, who served as commissioner of insurance in Texas in 1993 and 1994 and is now director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. ''They're either gouging now or they used erroneous assumptions then,'' Mr. Hunter said. At Fitch Ratings, which tracks the financial strength of companies, Jim Auden, a senior manager, said, ''They're trying to price to make an adequate profit.'' In 2005, the property and casualty industry reported an overall profit of $43.2 billion. Home insurers, despite their heavy losses along the coasts, reported slightly better than break-even returns for the year because of investment gains and profits elsewhere in the country. So far, there have been no major hurricanes this year, and Mr. Hunter said that if the season ended quietly, ''You're going to see such obscene profits, it's going to be shocking.'' In the meantime, John Miller is giving up on coastal living. After 15 years in Florida, Mr. Miller, a building contractor, has bought a house in the Carolinas and plans to move as soon as he can sell his house in Hobe Sound, near the Intercoastal Waterway. He said he was moving because of an accumulation of problems, including having to cope with more frequent hurricanes. But, he added, about 60 percent of the reason was insurance. ''You get sick of all this,'' Mr. Miller said."
"TO reach the executive suite of the Liberty Bank and Trust Company here, you first have to navigate a stretch of town that still lacks street signs. Finding an entrance to the bank's headquarters is another challenge. You have to circle behind the building, a six-story glass box that is still missing several windows, and -- as if there to work on the plumbing -- walk up a set of corrugated steel steps sandwiched between a Dumpster and an oversized air-conditioning unit. After traversing a bare room that smells of mildew and walking past three disabled elevators, you trudge up five more flights of steel stairs to reach the office of Alden J. McDonald Jr., the chief executive of this institution, which was the country's third-largest black-owned bank until Hurricane Katrina and floodwaters roared through New Orleans one year ago. Mr. McDonald and his staff count themselves among the fortunate, despite the general state of disrepair inside and outside their building. While their neighborhood wants for many basic amenities, including mail delivery and phone service, their company is one of the few enterprises back in business in the vast northeastern quadrant of New Orleans. And in a city where an estimated two in three businesses remain shuttered, Liberty is not only open but also turning a profit. Floodwaters still covered much of New Orleans last September when Mr. McDonald first agreed to allow a reporter to chronicle his efforts and those of his staff to resuscitate their battered bank. Working out of a beachhead that Mr. McDonald established in Baton Rouge just after the storm, Liberty seemed on the edge of ruin. Its long-term survival seemed in doubt. Liberty's most impressive accomplishment, like that of New Orleans itself, may simply be that it has regained some semblance of its old self in only 12 months. But Liberty is also like New Orleans and its ravaged economy in another crucial way: its recovery has a long way to go. Liberty faces enormous hurdles, chief among them the lingering doubts about the viability of large stretches of the drowned-out, predominantly black eastern half of the city, where Liberty's customers were concentrated and which is still largely in ruin. Liberty's success in helping black professionals and others settle the east established a large African-American homeownership class for the first time in the city's history. But that legacy, combined with the bank's backing of the city's small but growing ranks of black entrepreneurs, prompts concern among experts contemplating how well Liberty will fare if its carefully cultivated customers never return. Liberty's very success, it seems, presents the bank with its greatest challenge. HURRICANE Katrina delivered body blows to virtually every business along the Gulf Coast, but few were more devastated than Liberty. One year after the storm, only half of the bank's eight New Orleans branches are open, and one of those has limited hours. Flooding badly damaged five branches and looters stole $700,000 from several branches, according to Mr. McDonald. Floodwaters overwhelmed a one-story operations center, which housed its paper records, and putrid water sat for weeks on the ground floor of its headquarters in New Orleans East, destroying the building's electrical system and elevators. Wind damage and rain destroyed sections of the building's top floors. Insurance will offset some of those losses, but there is no compensating Liberty for the miseries visited upon its customers. Jobs disappeared as businesses closed and flooding destroyed or badly damaged the homes of roughly three-quarters of Liberty's customers -- and of most of the bank's staff, including Mr. McDonald. By some measurements, Liberty is doing astonishingly well. After posting losses of $3.4 million in 2005, its worst performance since opening its doors 34 years ago, Liberty reported a $2 million profit in the first half of 2006. ''We're feeling very hopeful about the future,'' Mr. McDonald said recently. Even so, Liberty has already slipped to fifth in a ranking of the country's largest black-owned banks, according to Creative Investment Research, a firm that tracks minority-owned financial institutions. ''Liberty seems to have done a remarkable job in a trying situation, certainly better than I ever thought possible,'' said William Michael Cunningham, an African-American who runs Creative Investment Research in Minneapolis. ''But my concern is with the health of the bank two years, three years out, especially with so many questions around the rebuilding.'' Will New Orleans truly come back, or is it destined to stand as a paler, less diverse version of its former self? There may be no better stand-in for addressing that question than this homegrown bank that, until Katrina, sparkled as a success tale, a black-owned institution in a predominantly African-American city that offered crucial service to sections of town historically underserved by mainstream banks. Alden McDonald awoke early on the Sunday before Katrina hit New Orleans last year. He planned to check on Liberty's various properties, ensuring that they had been properly secured, and then to join his wife inside the concrete fortress of the Hyatt hotel in the central business district, to ride out the storm. But Mr. McDonald, a native New Orleanian, changed his mind about staying as he toured the city. Listening to his car radio, he began to appreciate the might of Katrina. He phoned his wife, who checked them out of the Hyatt one hour after checking them in. The pair decided to retreat to the home of good friends in Atlanta. Then Mr. McDonald, like much of the world, hunkered down helplessly as he watched television coverage of his flooded city and tried hard to think about something other than retiring. ''My entire operation was under water,'' Mr. McDonald, 63, said. ''Which meant I had to go back and rebuild everything. I had to rebuild all systems. I had to rebuild all files. I didn't know how many of my customers would stay with me.'' He also did not know the fate of tens of millions of dollars that Liberty had lent to homeowners and entrepreneurs in the part of the city that locals referred to simply as ''the east.'' ''The only thing I could think of is, 'All of these people lost their real estate, which I had as collateral,' '' Mr. McDonald said. ''I knew I had insurance on a lot of it, but I still didn't know how much at the time.'' Sitting in his friend's home, he wondered if his bank's days as an independent institution were over. This bout of pessimism lasted two or three days, Mr. McDonald said, and over the coming months he was careful never to betray even a hint of doubt about the bank's future. He had been Liberty's chief executive since its founding in 1972, when its sole facility was a trailer in a sketchy part of town. He knew about hard times. After a few days in Atlanta, he started working on a survival plan that would quickly bring him to Baton Rouge. ''There were a lot of people depending on me to make this thing come back,'' he said. ''My staff. The community.'' Liberty had three outposts in Baton Rouge, 80 miles northwest of New Orleans, and two in Jackson, Miss., 160 miles due north. Those branches would prove crucial in the coming months, providing both ballast in unstable times and a base from which to operate. For the next six months, one of the Baton Rouge branches, a homely, spacious brick building missing a corner of its corrugated tin roof, served as the command post for Mr. McDonald and about 20 employees. Two of them, seated on beat-up borrowed chairs behind a pair of folding tables, served as Liberty's loan department. Four tables pushed together in the middle of a room accommodated a makeshift call center -- after BellSouth installed extra phone lines, nine days after the hurricane. Even after the bank set up a dozen phone lines to field calls, customers preferred driving to Baton Rouge from as far away as Houston and northern Louisiana, in order to meet in person with a bank employee. ''Basically it's everyone's job to deal with customers right now,'' Mr. McDonald said at the time, ''including mine.'' Customer service was one major concern right after the storm; reconnecting the bank to the global A.T.M. system was another. Unlike larger banks, which had operation centers around the country, and smaller ones, which tended to outsource data processing, Liberty housed its central computers in New Orleans, which was without electricity or working telephone lines in Katrina's aftermath. Mr. McDonald had prepared for the hurricane the same way he prepared for past storms, by creating several backup copies of the bank's computer records. Two employees got copies and Mr. McDonald sent two more via FedEx to a Pennsylvania company that handles the bank's computer operations during emergencies. But Mr. McDonald did not hear from either employee for more than a week after the storm, and Katrina interrupted FedEx's service for days. With customers scattered around the nation and desperate for cash, Mr. McDonald faced a tough choice: to lock out customers from A.T.M.'s and branches in the midst of the crisis and risk being cast as a Scrooge, or to allow them to withdraw cash and risk being ripped off because he temporarily had no way to determine how much money customers actually had in their accounts. Mr. McDonald chose the second option, permitting anyone with a Liberty account to withdraw up to $100, and then up to $500, per day. In the end, that cost the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars in overdrafts during the 10 days that Liberty's records were off the A.T.M. network. Mr. McDonald's next big worry was cash flow. The same floods that destroyed homes also wiped out jobs. That meant Liberty needed to brace for a steep drop in deposits and mortgage payments. Liberty, like many other area banks, gave both homeowners and its small-business customers until Jan. 1 to resume monthly loan payments -- depriving the bank of its two largest revenue streams for four months while it racked up a number of extraordinary expenses. EMERGENCY computer services were costing the bank more than $50,000 a month, so Mr. McDonald ordered a new computer system, despite its $500,000 price. He spent thousands of dollars dispatching boats to eastern New Orleans to assess damage and to retrieve computers and furniture for Liberty's temporary home in Baton Rouge. Once the floodwaters receded, he brought in emergency generators to keep air blowing through his headquarters to fight mold; filling the generators' fuel tanks cost $1,500 a week. Apartments in Baton Rouge for displaced employees cost thousands of dollars a month. ''I hate losing money,'' Mr. McDonald said in early October, six weeks after the storm. ''But everywhere I look I'm losing money.'' He had packed only a few short-sleeved shirts and one pair of slacks when he left New Orleans, thinking that he was leaving for a few days. Yet four weeks passed before he was finally able to take a day to relax in Baton Rouge and buy new clothes. ''Thank goodness I thought to bring four pair of underwear with me,'' he joked. A courtly man with a shock of wavy white hair and a bushy white mustache, Mr. McDonald is more animated than one might expect of a bank president. He laughs often, and, to underscore a point, will let his mouth hang slack-jawed. It would be a month after Katrina before he visited his home for the first time in New Orleans East -- a journey he took, he said, because ''my wife was bugging me to get stuff out of the house.'' Amid muck and mold, he found little to salvage in his home. At the end of each day, usually around 7 p.m., Mr. McDonald convened a small group in his office for what he called ''my daily crisis management meeting.'' Early on, the gatherings served as forums for sharing bad news. The new computer had arrived (cheers) but parts were missing (groans). New parts had arrived (huzzahs) but not crucial software components (more groans). Tasks that people thought might take a week or two, such as reviving the bank's Web site, ended up requiring a month or more. The daily financial updates were still more depressing. Before the storm, Liberty generated $150,000 a month in loan fees, but those funds largely evaporated in the first weeks after the storm because the bank was writing virtually no loans. The bank normally collected $70,000 in monthly charges from checking accounts -- but Liberty temporarily suspended this fee for most of its customers. These grim financial realities invariably caused people to ask Mr. McDonald how Liberty could survive. The bank had roughly $40 million in securities, an ample cushion against insolvency if Mr. McDonald could stabilize its finances. But the clock was ticking, and to raise much-needed cash, Liberty sold a portion of its securities at a $1 million loss. '''These are nervous times for the bank,'' said Norman C. Francis, Liberty's chairman, five weeks after Katrina. MR. McDONALD was largely alone in those first months after the storm. The bank's chief operating officer had resigned earlier that year to take a job in Detroit and Mr. McDonald had let his chief financial officer go shortly after the storm. Monthly board meetings continued, but directors had their own distractions. All but one had lost a home in the storm, and all had other responsibilities that needed attention. ''All of us had a lot going on,'' said Mr. Francis, the president of Xavier University, a historically black college in New Orleans that had been flooded. That was especially true for Mr. McDonald, who was appointed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin to the 17-member commission created last September to devise a blueprint for rebuilding New Orleans. ''Anything we do to get people back in town helps my bank,'' Mr. McDonald said at the time. If the first two months after the storm were about bailing water to keep a sinking bank afloat, the next six months were about reigniting Liberty's financial engines. Mortgage payments would restart after the first of the year, and the bank could once again count on a steady stream of fee income. But every week brought more closing of accounts by longtime customers, often because there were no Liberty branches near their new homes. The top priority during this second phase was to analyze the bank's loan portfolio and to gauge the likelihood of loan defaults. That meant figuring out who had adequate homeowner insurance and who did not. Those without flood insurance were likely to default on their loans and leave Liberty with largely worthless collateral: flood- and hurricane-ravaged homes and businesses. Analyzing potential defaults would have been fairly routine if the bank had access to its paper records, but the floods had destroyed those. So Mr. McDonald assigned a small team of people to track down individual borrowers. ''I can't even begin to tell you how many hundreds of hours we spent on that piece,'' he said. (In time, though, he will know the precise costs: he has asked his new chief financial officer to tally the figure so he can submit it with insurance claims.) IN October, Mr. McDonald opened a pair of branches in neighborhoods that were beginning to repopulate: the Garden District and the West Bank. Almost immediately, lines began to form as customers were eager to get on with their lives. By November, the precipitous drop in Liberty's deposits had stopped. ''People were increasing their balances rather than decreasing their balances,'' Mr. McDonald said. It was then, he realized, that his bank might make it. He might have been confident about the bank's prospects, but a large portion of his customer base still had no idea when they would move home, if ever. Working with lobbyists in Washington, he tried, unsuccessfully, to have Congress pass a law requiring the federal government to funnel a large portion of Gulf Coast redevelopment funds through smaller community banks like Liberty. He thought, too, about raising his profile nationally and catering to larger corporate depositors, like Aetna and American Express, which he already had as customers. In the end, ''Phase 2,'' as Mr. McDonald took to calling it, entailed doing what the bank always did -- selling its services to individuals -- but doing so with more creative flair. Earlier this year, Liberty repackaged certificates of deposits as Katrina Investment Deposits, or K.I.D.'s, which were nothing but C.D.'s offered at a below-market interest rate and wrapped in a feel-good package. Countless people had offered to help Liberty, and this was the financial vehicle it created to capitalize on that goodwill. Though he gave people a choice between interest rates of 2 percent and 2.5 percent, ''quite a few people chose 2 percent,'' Mr. McDonald said. (That rate was well below the 5 percent or so that a customer could have earned on a regular C.D. last spring.) Over the coming months, Liberty would sell $10 million worth of K.I.D.'s -- using the money to jump-start lending, its primary source of profits. To further bolster his flagging loan business, Mr. McDonald offered 100 percent mortgage financing and set in motion a plan to open loan centers in strip malls in other parts of Louisiana as well as Texas and Mississippi. ''I needed those fees,'' he said. ''I needed to get my interest income up.'' Liberty's staff was able to qualify enough people to approve $10 million in loans in less than three months. That amount exceeded Mr. McDonald's expectations, but it was still just a fraction of the $10 million a month that Liberty lent, on average, before Katrina. Today the bank is writing no more than $3 million a month in loans, Mr. McDonald said, and has stopped writing riskier, no-money-down loans. In time, Mr. McDonald would complain that while he took time every Monday to drive to New Orleans to attend meetings of Mayor Nagin's commission, the group never discussed the core issue of what to do about the city's most heavily damaged neighborhoods. To this day the city is without a coherent plan for the east. But his trips gave Mr. McDonald an excuse to drive through neighborhoods to see where people were returning. Those tours persuaded him to open two branches in January in Gentilly, a large, racially mixed area in the center of New Orleans. Other banks, including Chase and Whitney National Bank, a venerable local institution, have followed him into Gentilly. A visit to all three banks in mid-August found what seemed to be a brisk pace of business. But Mr. McDonald stressed that he was the first to open in Gentilly, and that move inspired envy in at least one rival. ''Right now I wish I had a branch in Gentilly,'' said Virgil Robinson Jr., the chief executive of Dryades Savings, a smaller black-owned bank based in New Orleans. An executive at Liberty until leaving in 1994, Mr. Robinson said his former boss had deftly negotiated that delicate balance between reopening a branch too early and waiting too long. ''We want to be back in the area early but not so early that we're the first one out there,'' said Mr. Robinson. ''There's protection in numbers.'' Mr. McDonald proved a trailblazer again in March, when he moved back into his headquarters in the east. When he is too tired to commute back home to Baton Rouge, he sleeps in a borrowed recreational vehicle. Viewed from the vantage point of the central business district or the French Quarter, the city and its business environment can seem to be in good shape. These areas have been repopulated, and businesses large and small have returned. Most of the city's hotels are open again, as are most of its major employers and its more popular restaurants and music clubs. Focusing solely on Liberty's branches in the western, predominantly white half of the city also might suggest that the bank's operations are more or less back to normal. But there appears to be relatively little forward motion in the city's eastern business corridors. In New Orleans East, for instance, home to 90,000 people before Katrina, maybe a half-dozen restaurants have opened. A few car dealerships are back in business, along with several gas stations and a giant Home Depot -- and Liberty. Mr. McDonald had anticipated that Katrina would translate into $10 million to $12 million in losses in the last four months of 2005. It ended up costing him half that much. When Katrina hit, Liberty was on pace to post a $3 million profit for the year. Instead, it lost $3.6 million. Some bright spots emerged. Only seven borrowers let their flood insurance lapse after taking a loan from Liberty; out of a $150 million loan portfolio, Liberty wrote off only $2 million last year. Most of those bad loans, Mr. McDonald said, were car loans or credit card debt. Like many other banks across the Gulf Coast region, Liberty is now flush with cash as people park large insurance settlements in their accounts while considering their next financial steps. This year has brought Mr. McDonald and his staff more good news. Based on results from the first half of 2006, he predicted that the bank would earn $4 million for the entire year. ''This is going to be the most profitable year in the history of this company,'' he said. Yet Liberty's buffed-up bottom line can be deceiving. A widespread lack of housing in New Orleans, Mr. McDonald acknowledged, has meant that the bank has fewer employees than it needs. Where he once had 160 employees, he now has 90. The shortage has kept expenses low, bolstering profitability, but the same shortage makes it hard to generate new revenue. Mr. McDonald wishes that he could hire more tellers, branch assistants, and loan officers and open a fifth branch in New Orleans, he said, ''except I'd have no one to staff it.'' ONE year ago, Liberty had 35,000 customers. Today it has 20,000 to 25,000, Mr. McDonald said. ''I know I have to get an exact count on that,'' he added, before letting his voice trail off. His half-staff bank, it seems, has other priorities. Elevator repairs alone will cost Liberty $350,000, and the bank has lost about $100,000 a month in rental income from tenants who once leased office space in its New Orleans headquarters but now have no immediate plans to move back home. Water, not wind, did most of the damage to Liberty, and it is still uncertain how much its insurers will cover. Mr. McDonald had business-interruption insurance, for instance, but he said it was not clear, even one year after Katrina, whether insurers would approve flood claims. ''Everyone is still struggling with insurance companies,'' he said. There is another question preoccupying anyone with a financial stake in the eastern half of New Orleans: Which parts of the city will come back and which will end up as forlorn, half-occupied neighborhoods without basic services? Mr. Nagin ended up ignoring his own commission's recommendation that New Orleans devote its limited resources to neighborhoods that can prove that a critical mass of their residents are returning. Instead, the mayor has encouraged people to rebuild anywhere they want in the city. Mr. McDonald's best guess is that only half the population of the east will eventually move home -- if that. Of the 150 families in his subdivision in New Orleans East, he knows about 10 families that are returning. He even counts himself among the undecided. From his sixth-floor office, Mr. McDonald has a perfect view of the mall next door. Its huge parking lot is empty, except for piles of debris, and its stores sit as ruined reminders of how much the east has lost and how little it has recovered. Mr. McDonald, meanwhile, intends to try to ''go to where my customers are'' by opening loan centers in strip malls and in places like Houston and some cities elsewhere in Louisiana and in Mississippi. ''Whenever you have obstacles,'' he says, ''you always have opportunities.''"
"High winds knocked down trees, created powerful waves and blew down utility lines yesterday, interrupting electricity to more than 200,000 homes and businesses as the remnants of Tropical Storm Ernesto swept through the region. Wind gusts of up to 35 miles an hour delayed some arriving flights at Kennedy International Airport for up to five and a half hours last night and for three hours at Newark Liberty International Airport on the busy Labor Day weekend, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. La Guardia Airport had no weather-related delays last night. On the last holiday weekend of summer, some beaches were virtually deserted except for a handful of intrepid surfers wearing wet suits enjoying 12-foot-high swells during a brisk, overcast day. Swimming was banned at several beaches on Long Island because of rip currents, according to The Associated Press. Ernesto was reduced to an area of rain over western New York State and the lower Great Lakes yesterday, after drenching Virginia and North Carolina with up to a foot on its run up the East Coast. The Associated Press reported that the storm caused flooding that forced hundreds of people out of their homes and at least four deaths were blamed on the storm in Virginia, and one in North Carolina. Flooding was still a problem yesterday in North Carolina, where the Northeast Cape Fear River was more than five feet above flood stage and not expected to crest until today, the National Weather Service said. The storm forced most play at the U.S. Open in Queens to be postponed until today, including matches involving Andy Roddick, Maria Sharapova and Andre Agassi. Some areas of Westchester County suffered flooding, but there were no reported storm-related deaths in the region. Several areas prone to flooding, including Broome and Delaware Counties avoided significant damage, law enforcement officials said. While only about one-quarter inch of rain fell on the city, according to the National Weather Service, the wind wreaked havoc. Umbrellas were turned inside out, cars on bridges swayed and at times, rain fell sideways and trees fell on cars. More than 60,000 customers lost power in New York City and Westchester County, with half of those outages in Westchester, said Martha Liipfert, spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison. By yesterday evening, about 40,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity, Ms. Liipfert said. In New Jersey, about 80,000 customers lost power at some point in the day, with most of those in the northern portion of the state. By last night, 27,800 homes and businesses remained without electricity -- all but 3,000 in the northeastern part of the state. The hardest hit areas were Teaneck, Bergenfield and New Millford, said Terry Moran, spokesman for a New Jersey utility company. In Connecticut, about 50,000 customers lost power, and on Long Island, about 34,000 customers, utility officials said."
"Hurricane John weakened to a tropical storm on Saturday, sparing the region's tourist resorts but spawning torrential streams that raced down mountainsides and blocked roads in the southern part of the Baja California peninsula. Two people who were reported missing after they were swept away by the waters were later found alive, officials said. The storm ''did not kill any of us,'' said José Gajon de la Toba, the director of civil protection for the state of Baja California Sur. The Los Cabos airport reopened by Saturday afternoon and American tourists who had waited out the storm in their hotels began returning home. But Mr. Gajon said that about 6,000 people were cut off in villages on the eastern coast of the peninsula near where the hurricane had made landfall. Rainwater swept down steep mountainsides to the sea and formed sudden rivers that flooded highways and made them impassable to all but heavy vehicles. Earthmovers cleared sand deposited by the rivers, and a few trucks made it through the water. The authorities planned to send two Mexican Navy helicopters carrying food and water to supply those villages late Saturday, Mr. Gajon said. Hurricane John had approached the peninsula on Friday as a Category 2 hurricane, one of the strongest in decades, but by Saturday afternoon, its strength had fallen and it was reduced to a tropical storm with winds of 70 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The storm was moving northwest along the peninsula and was expected to continue dumping rain over Baja California overnight and into Sunday before heading out over the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane center said. More than 5,000 people spent Friday night in shelters as the storm spared Los Cabos and passed over the state capital, La Paz, the area's largest city. In the poor neighborhood of El Zacatal, Valente Tamayo, 35, a mechanic, sent his wife and three children to a shelter set up in a nearby elementary school. He spent the night in a car that he was repairing, and took the family's clothes in with him to keep them dry. But during the night, the winds blew part of the roof off the family's two-room plywood house and the rain soaked their beds and their possessions. ''We'll just have to wait to see what happened and take them out to dry,'' said Mr. Tamayo's wife, Andrea Agude, 32. ''Then maybe the government will help us.'' There was scattered damage in San Jose del Cabo and La Paz, with trees, street signs and electricity posts downed by the winds, Mr. Gajon said. Electric service was being restored to La Paz throughout the day, he said."
"Hundreds of thousands of people in the New York region remained without power yesterday, with one utility saying it may take until Wednesday for its work crews to repair damage left by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ernesto. At its worst, more than 200,000 business and residential customers -- perhaps 800,000 people by the usual rule of thumb of four people to an account -- had lost power during the rough weather, but by yesterday afternoon a majority had had their electricity restored. Still hurting were parts of Connecticut and Westchester County, with more than 82,000 business and residential customers without power yesterday afternoon. A number of customers faced the prospect of at least another day without electricity. Consolidated Edison said power to some of its New York customers might not be restored until as late as Wednesday. Utility officials described a painstaking process of clearing storm debris and restoring electrical lines to return power to sometimes just one or two customers at a time. Utilities in New Jersey and Long Island reported several hundred customers still without electricity yesterday and said they would regain power by early today. In Weston, Conn., at St. Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church, the church was dark during the 11 a.m. Mass except for the flicker of candlelight and the sun filtering through stained glass. Todd Caporizzo, a church cantor, cleared his throat and announced, ''We have no power'' for the church organ, ''and will everyone just sing a bit louder?'' In New Rochelle, N.Y., nearly all of the businesses were closed at Main Street Plaza. The Verizon cellphone store managed by Yasser Reda, 49, was an exception. The store was dark, and Mr. Reda was sitting on the sidewalk outside the store in an office chair. He realized that with the power out in homes, people would need to recharge their cellphones from the cigarette lighters in their cars. In a day, Mr. Reda usually would sell three or four such chargers, priced at $30 each, but yesterday he sold 25. ''That's a lot for a Sunday,'' he said, smiling. In Larchmont, N.Y., on Boston Post Road, businesses were also closed, except for Villa Maria Pizza, which was doing a brisk business. Anthony Pecora, 37, the owner, was able to stay open with a gas-powered generator and a new $3,500 dough maker that can work off the generator. ''We've learned to live through'' power failures, Mr. Pecora said. As of 10 p.m. yesterday, Con Edison reported more than 36,000 customers still without power, principally in Westchester County but with 1,000 power failures in Riverdale in the Bronx and 140 on Staten Island. The utility said it had more than 300 work crews repairing the damage. Connecticut Light and Power also had 27,000 remaining power failures, mostly in Norwalk, Greenwich and Stamford, down from a peak of 54,483. In Rowayton, a coastal village that is part of the city of Norwalk, the storm had made a mess of the neighborhood around the home of Frank and Nancy Schlater. The electricity went out in the afternoon and the couple got by on Saturday night on electric lanterns. On Roton Avenue, an enormous tree had fallen and pulled down power lines, a century-old apple tree in Pinkney Park had been uprooted and lay on its side, and a fishing boat and a sailboat had been beached. ''This morning we walked to South Beach on Bell Island, and the whole road is just sand,'' Mrs. Schlater said yesterday. ''You would never know there was a road there.'' At Greenwich's Indian Harbor Yacht Club, six yachts, some as large as 50 feet, had broken from their moorings during the storm and smashed on the rocks, said David Foster, the club's general manager. ''Any shoreline community from Greenwich to Bridgeport has a big cleanup,'' Gordon Joseloff, Westport's first selectman, said yesterday. ''It was a devastating storm and probably the worst Westport has seen since 1992 when we had a nor'easter.'' The storm even took its toll on literacy. In New Rochelle, John Sotallaro, 60, who works in a construction-sales office, was watching television on Saturday afternoon when rain ended the Yankee game in the eighth inning, with the Minnesota Twins winning 6-1. ''I figured it was a good time to pick up a book,'' Mr. Sotallaro said, ''and then the power went out.''"
"Heavy rains destroyed homes, killed livestock and washed out roads through the middle of Baja California, officials said Sunday, as Tropical Storm John continued its advance up the peninsula. Nobody had died from the storm, but many were left homeless in the northern part of the state of Baja California Sur, which covers the southern portion of the peninsula. ''It has rained more than ever before in our history,'' said José Gajón de la Toba, the state's civil protection director. Mr. Gajón said it was still too early to estimate how many people had lost their homes in the storm. Many homes made of plywood and tar paper were flooded or destroyed. Crops were destroyed and cows, goats and sheep died in the storm, he said. President Vicente Fox was expected to visit the region and tour La Paz, a city of 150,000 where the storm did serious damage. Navy helicopters were to fly food and water to the most isolated regions. The state's highways were spared but local roads were ''in pieces,'' cutting off small communities, Mr. Gajón said. The hardest-hit regions of the state were the counties of Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé. The storm approached the peninsula from the southwest on Thursday as the strongest hurricane to threaten the region in recent memory. It spared the coastal resort of Los Cabos on Friday as it shifted to the east and its winds weakened as it traveled up the peninsula. Much of the state's telephone communication was cut off Sunday because the storm had damaged lines to the rest of the country. Electricity service and cellular phone service were out in much of the state. By Sunday night, the storm was still dumping rain on the arid peninsula and threatening flash floods. The United States' national hurricane center in Miami said that up to 6 inches of rain was expected, with as much as 18 inches in some places. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression on Sunday evening. By 8 p.m., centered 80 miles northwest of Santa Rosalía, its strongest winds had dissipated to 35 miles an hour. Forecasters said it would continue to move north along the east coast of Baja, bringing heavy rains to northern Baja and Southern California. The airport serving Los Cabos reopened Saturday and was jammed with tourists on Sunday trying to catch flights out of the beach towns, which remained shuttered. While the storm spoiled some vacations, it destroyed the homes of many employees at large hotels. The mayor of Los Cabos, Luis Armando Díaz, told The Associated Press that the hurricane had damaged homes and cut off the highway between his town and La Paz. The authorities reported flood waters had swept one man away in a car on Saturday in La Paz, but he was found alive hours later, clinging to a branch in the middle of a stream."
"Most insurance executives look at the lavish houses and condominiums along the Florida coasts and cannot help thinking: hurricanes, wreckage, financial ruin. But Ross J. Buchmueller sees opportunity. As most big insurers are cutting back coverage in Florida and other coastal states after a string of catastrophic hurricanes, Mr. Buchmueller has started a company offering policies that hardly anyone else wants to sell -- and at as little as half the going rates. His strategy, he says, is not as daring as it seems. By studying industry statistics, he has found that big, expensive houses have fared the best in hurricanes. And his company will sell only to owners of those homes. To be covered, a home must be worth more than $1 million. It must be fairly new, solidly built and equipped with the strongest shutters, or such high-grade windows that flying debris merely bounces off them. Mr. Buchmueller said that to further reduce his risk, sales in the first year will be limited to a few thousand policies and he will buy insurance from big international insurance companies, known as reinsurers, that will cover 75 percent of his potential losses. The cost of the reinsurance will sharply lower his profit. But Mr. Buchmueller, 41, has set up his company, Privilege Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange, as a nonprofit concern, owned by its policyholders. His reward, Mr. Buchmueller says, will come from a management fee, which should rise as the company grows and expands into a national business. Mr. Buchmueller has been quietly selling policies for several weeks and plans to announce the opening of his new company formally today. Some insurance experts say the venture may inspire other entrepreneurs -- or groups of property owners, like condominium associations -- to create similar arrangements. Doing so could help break the crippling pattern in which big, established insurers reduce coverage, and investors in new companies chase ever-higher premium prices. But others are skeptical. ''It's a creative approach,'' said Michael Koziol, a public policy specialist at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, a large insurance trade group, ''but like any new company, there's a certain risk. More new companies go under than old companies.'' Robert P. Hartwig, the president and chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said that even with insurance premium prices at a record high in Florida, they were still not high enough to offset all the potential damage that many weather analysts expect over the next decade or so. Mr. Buchmueller says his company will have considerably more capital than most Florida start-ups -- an estimated $45 million by the end of the year. And he says that he is confident that he has found a gap in the market where the going prices are higher than the actual risk. ''Everyone in Florida thinks they're paying too much for insurance,'' he said, ''and some of them are right.'' Florida has been hit by a number of hurricanes in the last few years. Insurers have paid billions of dollars in claims, and the price of coverage for homes in the state is the highest in the nation. Some people are paying almost as much for insurance as for mortgage payments. And every week, 15,000 homeowners in Florida are requesting bare-bones coverage from the state-run insurance agency because no one else will sell it to them -- at any price. In January, Florida's Legislature went into special session to deal with the insurance crisis and decided to force down prices for all companies, including Mr. Buchmueller's, by perhaps 20 percent. But many insurance experts say that if hurricane damage is heavy in the next few years, the state will probably have to make up for the price cut and possibly a lot more in claims costs by issuing bonds and passing on potentially enormous expenses to all policyholders. Florida regulators welcomed Mr. Buchmueller's company as a new source of coverage. They approved his plan in mid-January, and he has started selling policies through independent agents across the state. Mr. Buchmueller previously spent about 20 years working for the Chubb Corporation and the American International Group. Charles Kilvert, the owner of the Claude D. Reese insurance agency in Palm Beach, said the first question he hears is: ''Are these guys going to pay their claims?'' ''I tell them, 'These guys are top-flight industry insiders,' '' he said. ''And they're very conservative. Whereas the state allows an insurance company to take in $10 of premium for every dollar it's got for paying claims, these guys are coming in at less than one to one.'' One of Mr. Buchmueller's first customers, Ellis Kern, owns a two-story pale yellow Mediterranean-style home on a golf course several miles inland from West Palm Beach. Mr. Kern, a manufacturing executive, said he had been paying $15,175.86 a year for $1.2 million in coverage from a unit of Lloyd's of London. He is now paying $6,845 to Mr. Buchmueller's company for $1.7 million in coverage. ''Obviously,'' he said, ''the first thing was that there was a savings.'' But Mr. Kern said he was also drawn to the company by its business plan. ''They were limiting their risk, being selective in who they were taking,'' he said. Patrick Lacy, a manager at the Plastridge Insurance Agency in Delray Beach, said he had been talking to a homeowner who had been paying $32,637 for $2.8 million in coverage. From the new company, Mr. Lacy said, the same coverage would cost $18,812. Customers of the new company are required to make an additional one-time payment equal to half their first-year premium into a fund for paying claims. Even then, costs are often lower than before. At the end of each year, Mr. Buchmueller said, any company money left over from claims and other expenses is to go into holding accounts for the policyholders, from which they can collect if they decide to drop their coverage. In the meantime, putting money that would otherwise be termed profit into special accounts will add to the company's ability to pay claims and also provide tax benefits. The structure Mr. Buchmueller chose has been used by groups of professionals -- doctors, lawyers and architects -- and some industries, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, when coverage they need has become scarce and extremely high priced. One of the biggest, most successful insurance companies in the country, USAA, is organized along the same lines. But recent start-ups have been structured to yield high profits as quickly as possible. One quirk of Mr. Buchmueller's company is that his rates, as approved by regulators, are about the same or higher than those of other insurers catering to the rich, like Chubb. A big difference is that the others routinely refuse to sell new coverage. And the few companies willing to provide the coverage can charge much higher rates. ''It's like going to the butcher,'' Mr. Buchmueller said, ''and he tells you that rib-eye sells for $1 a pound. But you go to buy it, and you can't have it.''"
"Richard F. Scruggs, one of the country's most successful trial lawyers, made his first fortune in a case that hit close to home. He sued asbestos makers on behalf of workers at the shipyard in his hometown, Pascagoula, who had developed lung diseases. He made his second fortune with lawsuits against the tobacco industry, coming up with a winning legal strategy in Mississippi that he then applied nationwide. But his latest legal battle -- trying to force insurers to pay more for damage from Hurricane Katrina -- literally hit home. His white-washed house on Beach Boulevard, just 50 yards from the Gulf of Mexico, is gone. The house, with its columned entrance and sunny breakfast room, appeared in the movie ''The Insider,'' about a whistle-blower who helped Mr. Scruggs win a $248 billion settlement in the tobacco case. It was so badly mangled that it had to be bulldozed to the foundation slab. The loss made him a partner in grief with tens of thousands of residents along the coast of Mississippi. Many turned to him in their battle for insurance money in a fight that has become a financial and public relations nightmare for the insurance industry. Mr. Scruggs, 60, slim, often folksy and smooth as molasses in court, is using techniques that he honed in his earlier legal fights. He is arguing now, as he did before to such good effect, that he is fighting for the little guy who cannot stand up alone to big anonymous companies. ''These are not just legal wars,'' Mr. Scruggs said in a recent interview. ''They are public relations and political wars.'' The insurance companies counter that Mr. Scruggs has portrayed them unfairly and misleadingly. ''Mr. Scruggs has taken a tiny portion of the claims associated with Katrina and tried to paint the entire insurance industry with a brush of malfeasance,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, president and chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute. ''And that is an entirely incorrect characterization.'' Joseph Annotti, a spokesman for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, whose members provide 40 percent of the home insurance in Mississippi and the rest of the country, calls Mr. Scruggs an opportunist. ''People are looking for someone to blame and someone to pay,'' Mr. Annotti said. ''He's playing on that anger and people's raw emotions. On our part, we underwrite policies that go through strict regulatory approval. Every word is approved by the state regulator.'' The insurance dispute centers on two main kinds of damage in a hurricane: wind and flooding. People along the Mississippi coast say they thought their policies covered any type of hurricane damage. The insurers, with the backing of the courts, have insisted that flooding is not included. But in some cases insurers have also refused to pay when a house was wrecked by both wind and flooding -- and there, a federal judge has ruled, they were wrong. Flood insurance is sold by the federal government. But fewer than 20 percent of the coastal residents in Mississippi bought it. Insurers note that they have paid $41 billion for damage from Katrina, including $5.5 billion for homes in Mississippi. The insurers add that only 1 percent of their customers have taken them to court, but that amounts to more than 2,000 lawsuits in Mississippi and many more in New Orleans and elsewhere in Louisiana that are being dealt with separately. For months after the hurricane hit on Aug. 29, 2005, the insurance dispute in Mississippi was stalled. But in mid-January a Biloxi couple won a $1 million verdict against State Farm, the largest home insurer in the nation and in Mississippi. Less than two weeks later, Mr. Scruggs completed negotiations on settlements with State Farm worth at least $130 million, setting the pattern, many insurance experts said, for resolving hundreds of other cases and potentially providing hundreds of millions of dollars for rebuilding along the coast. Mr. Scruggs conceded he has used ''every trick in the book'' to gain advantage over the insurers. ''This is very personal,'' he said. ''This is about my family, my friends, the people I grew up with. I wake up at 3:30 every morning thinking of ways to get at this thing.'' In what some of his critics sniff at as unlawyerly decorum, he missed no opportunity to bash the insurers in newspaper and television interviews and press releases. He embraced two whistle-blowers who walked away from their jobs as claims adjusters, taking with them thousands of State Farm documents. Then he turned over the information to the attorney general of Mississippi, who began a criminal investigation. In his talks with State Farm, Mr. Scruggs regularly dropped the names of two of his clients -- his brother-in-law, Senator Trent Lott, and his friend, Representative Gene Taylor, who both lost houses to Katrina and had their claims rejected by State Farm. Both men have been leading efforts in Congress to eliminate the industry's exemption from antitrust laws and to strip the insurers of some tax benefits. Also, at their behest, federal investigators have been looking into some of the practices regarding claims payments that Mr. Scruggs has been challenging. [On Monday, Mr. Scruggs surprised State Farm by abruptly filing court papers to withdraw from the agreement he had engineered. But other lawyers said they thought Mr. Scruggs was merely maneuvering to force State Farm to agree to modifications requested by Federal Judge L. T. Senter Jr. to improve terms for policy holders before approving the deal. [State Farm said it had not been consulted by Mr. Scruggs on the move. But Phil Supple, a spokesman, said the company was ''still open to any reasonable and just proposal to put these issues behind us.'' [In a separate case, a jury in Gulfport, Miss., on Thursday awarded a homeowner $66,234, and State Farm settled the policy holder's claim for punitive damage for an undisclosed amount.] Mr. Scruggs began his career often defending insurance companies at a prestigious law firm in Jackson after graduating from the University of Mississippi Law School in 1976. Looking for more independence and more money, Mr. Scruggs said he persuaded his wife, Diane, to move back to Pascagoula, the hard-scrabble town where they both were raised. His first year on his own he tripled his income. ''I was not altruistic,'' he said. Not long after, he began handling the asbestos cases of workers at the Ingalls shipyard. ''Over time, I became aware of how they were being treated by their employers,'' he said. ''Like another consumable in the manufacturing process. Like a welding rod.'' Mr. Scruggs and several partners received $50 million for their work on the asbestos cases. He used the asbestos money to bankroll the litigation against big tobacco and has been using the tobacco money to take on other industries, like health care and now home insurance. Mr. Scruggs said his first objective in his latest legal battle was to help people get back on their feet. But he also wanted to tilt the balance of power in insurance more toward the customer. In hopes of getting stricter regulation, he has quietly begun campaigning to replace George Dale as commissioner of insurance in Mississippi and he is pushing insurers to rewrite their policies in plain English. ''The policies are designed to be ambiguous,'' Mr. Scruggs said. ''They can say, 'This is as clear as the nose on your face,' or, 'It doesn't mean that at all.' All this litigation has got people talking and realizing that these insurance companies really aren't in it for them. They're in it for themselves.'' Not so, the insurers say. ''There's no benefit in short-changing consumers,'' Mr. Annotti said. ''But you have to draw the line somewhere and say, 'Look, these were the terms of the policy.' '' Mr. Scruggs came to terms with State Farm in two phases. First, the insurer agreed to pay $80 million to 640 homeowners, many of whom had been originally denied any payment by the company. Then, State Farm agreed to reopen damage claims for up to 36,000 others. In that agreement, State Farm said it would pay at least $50 million. Some lawyers, who are pursuing separate cases against the insurers and who oppose the larger settlement, have raised suspicions that Mr. Scruggs drove a harder bargain for his initial clients, the 640 homeowners, than for the others. And there have been complaints from rival lawyers about potential fees of more than $46 million for Mr. Scruggs and the pick-up team of two dozen lawyers in his Scruggs Katrina Group. Mr. Scruggs, who has earned more than he says he could spend in 10 life times, said he got the best deal he could for all his clients and that the earnings of his group would rise as payouts to homeowners increase. He said he would never have signed off on a deal that slighted coast residents. ''It's important to me to be respected in your hometown,'' he said. ''Not to betray, or be perceived to betray, the people who got you where you are.'' Mr. Scruggs said that his own insurer, USAA, had paid him several hundred thousand dollars but that his claim was still not fully resolved. He was one of the few homeowners along the coast who bought federal flood insurance, and he said he was paid the maximum $250,000 on the house and $80,000 for some of the furnishings. As part of the settlements with State Farm, Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, agreed to end his criminal investigation of the company and drop it from a civil lawsuit that accuses most of the insurers in Mississippi of failing to live up to commitments in their policies. State Farm further angered Mississippians by declaring that because of an uncertain legal climate in the state, it would stop providing new coverage on homes. Mr. Scruggs said he was sure other companies would come in to pick up the slack. ''If this is the way State Farm is going to treat their trusted customers, then don't let the door hit them in the fanny,'' he said. The insurance companies may not like Mr. Scruggs. But if he wanted to run for office in Mississippi, now might be a good time. Outside the Beau Rivage Casino in Biloxi one morning, Michael Foster, a security worker, overheard a reporter on a cellphone arranging to meet Mr. Scruggs. ''He's good people,'' Mr. Foster said after the phone call ended. ''He's down to earth. If he tells you something, it's gospel.'' Less than a year before the hurricane, Mr. Scruggs bought a house in Oxford, Miss., the home of the University of Mississippi. He had already shifted his main office there. Since then, Mr. Scruggs, a former Navy pilot, has commuted to the coast in a corporate jet that he often flies himself. In Pascagoula, he stays in a boxy mobile home parked on the waterfront slab where Senator Lott's home once stood. He has sold his bare lot on Beach Boulevard, but he has not abandoned the coast. He is repairing storm damage to his late father-in-law's home, and plans to make that his Pascagoula home. It is about 100 yards farther back from the water than the home he lost to Katrina."
"IN one 24-hour period last week in New Orleans, now a small city of 200,000, six people were murdered. Last year's total of 161 murders probably made New Orleans the deadliest city in the United States by a significant margin. I suppose it was only a matter of time before the violence touched my life directly. Last Thursday morning I received a call from my friend Kittee. ''I have awful news,'' she said, and then, very quickly: ''Someone broke into Paul and Helen's house. Helen was shot and killed. Paul was holding Baby Francis and was shot three times. He's still alive. Francis is O.K.'' Paul Gailiunas -- Dr. Paul, I call him -- had been my physician for several years at the Little Doctors Clinic, a health center for poor people that he founded in Treme, one of America's oldest black neighborhoods. I had started to see Paul after my previous doctor mocked one of my colleagues about our work representing people on Louisiana's death row. When I met Paul through a friend, I asked him directly, ''Are you in favor of the death penalty?'' He responded, with a smile, ''Eh, I'm Canadian,'' clearly feeling that was answer enough. And it was, coming from the founder of our local chapter of Food Not Bombs and the front man for the Troublemakers (a band whose songs celebrate Emma Goldman and the idea of universal health care) in such a lighthearted tone that it would scarcely have alienated the most ardent conservative. Helen Hill was Paul's perfect match -- a kind and generous woman who made award-winning animated films and taught art and filmmaking to children, adults, anyone who was interested. She'd spent much of the last year restoring reels of 16-millimeter film on which she had drawn by hand, and which had been damaged when their house took four feet of water during Hurricane Katrina. She had a new film under way, inspired by discarded hand-sewn dresses, made by an elderly New Orleanian, which Helen had found in the trash after the woman's death. The film interwove the story of the old woman and her dresses with Helen's own flood-torn life, which took her, Paul and Francis to Columbia, S.C. -- Helen's hometown, where she will be buried today -- for almost a year. Helen had longed to return to New Orleans, despite Paul's concern that crime and potential hurricanes made it too dangerous for their family. So Helen campaigned, sending Paul's friends in New Orleans blank postcards, addressed to Paul, for us to write and mail to him. In mine, I pleaded with Paul -- ''We need you'' -- the way I do with anyone who is thinking about leaving, coming to, or even just visiting New Orleans. After what I am sure was a flood of similar cards, Paul relented. I saw Paul and the baby a day after their return to the city, at a parade on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Francis had on a little railroad conductor's hat, a T-shirt depicting a cartoon love affair between red beans and rice (the New Orleans Monday lunch classic), and a little sign pinned to his back, in Helen's hand: ''New Orleans Native. I Got Back Yesterday!'' The day of the anniversary was solemn but optimistic. Everyone still had a can-do attitude. Paul, for one, could help make the city's people well and improve health care for the poor. Helen could make art depicting the city's life. Others could rebuild schools, demand better levees, reconstruct their homes. It still felt as if our grassroots efforts, along with some real help from a government finally forced to make good on its obligations, could create a more just, fair and safe city. It might have been naïve, but it really seemed possible. After wandering this beautiful, falling-over city the afternoon after Helen's murder, forcing myself to remember why I love it here so much, I came back to my garden and picked flowers, those hardy few that had weathered the recent cold. I put them in a vase, wrote out the verses to Edna St. Vincent Millay's ''Dirge Without Music'' -- ''I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground / So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind'' -- and drove to the couple's house, which my wife and I had recently visited for Helen's open studio. On the steps leading up to their old shotgun house I set down the poem and the vase, just feet from where Paul had been found by the police, shot, bleeding, holding his baby. On the way home, I stopped at my neighborhood bar to try to eat something. A picture of Paul and Helen, followed by one of the baby, appeared on the television in the corner. Oh, my God. The bartender was kind. She asked me whether I knew them, and talked to me about her fears living with her new baby in a city with no functional schools, no real plan for redevelopment, and spotty or nonexistent basic services. The TV news switched to a weather report: torrential downpours were expected to dump half a foot of rain overnight. I drove home in the twilight and arrived uneasy and restless. Remembering the coming rain, I resolved to make myself useful to my block by digging out a sewer so backed up that the street -- on high ground by New Orleans standards -- floods at even the hint of rain. I had done this many times before, having realized that my innumerable calls to the city were in vain. I pried up the 100-pound cast iron cover with a shovel and then shimmied it from side to side until I had the two-by-four sewer open. It was full to the top with debris. I shoveled out the leaves, dirt, Popeye's cups and other garbage until the small brick rectangle was as clean as it was a century ago, when New Orleans first created this drainage system. Then I set to work on clearing the cylindrical drain -- about as wide as a hubcap, at the bottom corner of the cleaned-out basin -- so that the rain could find its way into the city's sewers, away from our houses, cars and belongings. I got down with a small shovel and burrowed through the muck until it seemed to open at the other side. Reaching in, though, I could feel that beyond the drain lay more dirt and leaves, packed hard. Indeed, it became clear to me that the whole sewer line running beneath the street was solid with waste, impenetrable to arms and shovels -- that my street would flood again that night. The problem, I realized, is bigger than me. I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.

"State Farm, the biggest home insurer in the nation, is in the final stages of settling hundreds of lawsuits over its payments for homes wrecked by Hurricane Katrina along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, lawyers briefed on the talks said yesterday. The settlement of 639 lawsuits for $80 million could be the first step in resolving a bitter legal battle between homeowners and their insurers that had threatened to drag on for years and has already slowed Mississippi's recovery since the storm in August 2005. As part of the proposed deal, which other insurers are expected to adopt, State Farm has agreed to review and possibly increase payments to as many as 35,000 additional homeowners. In some cases, these homeowners received only a few thousand dollars for homes along the Mississippi coast that suffered major damage or were destroyed. The talks do not apply to homeowners in New Orleans and the rest of Louisiana. State Farm, under the tentative accord, would provide an average of about $125,000 to homeowners who filed lawsuits, although the payments would range from as little as about $2,000 to about $2 million. The treatment of those cases would serve as a guide for increasing payments to any of the 35,000 homeowners who request a review of their claim, according to lawyers privy to the details. Similar settlements with the dozen or so other insurers in Mississippi could provide hundreds of millions of dollars for recovery along the coast. It would also close a painful chapter in the public relations history of the carriers who have been portrayed by opposing lawyers as coldhearted in refusing to pay for much of Katrina's devastation. ''This is an opportunity to change public perception,'' said Randy Maniloff, a lawyer in Philadelphia who represents insurance companies, and who has not been involved in the talks. The heart of the dispute in Mississippi as well as in Louisiana has been over the coverage of flood damage. Flooding was far worse in Katrina than in most previous hurricanes. The insurers argued successfully in Mississippi that their policies did not provide coverage for any kind of flooding. But Judge L. T. Senter Jr., of Federal District Court in Gulfport, Miss., rejected the argument by insurers that if any flooding damaged a house, the insurers then had no responsibility for any other damage caused by Katrina's high winds. More than 2,000 homeowners in Mississippi alone filed suit against their insurers. Under terms of the tentative settlement, State Farm would pay at least $50 million for claims that were previously closed, and some lawyers say the cost for State Farm could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, depending upon how many homeowners requested their files be reopened and the extent of damage to their houses. A similar deal with other insurers could lead to an estimated 100,000 other closed claims being re-examined, lawyers briefed on the talks said. Insurance experts said State Farm's willingness to engage in settlement talks should not be interpreted as a concession that it did anything wrong. They said a final agreement would almost certainly say, in effect, that State Farm was neither acknowledging nor denying objectionable practices. Further, they said, State Farm would not want to set precedent on future payments for flood damage from hurricanes. ''They're willing to settle,'' said Gary S. Thompson, a Washington lawyer who represents individual and commercial policyholders, ''because they know they would have to go through a long, arduous journey examining each and every claim.'' That could take years, some lawyers said. In the meantime, State Farm's reputation would be further battered and, facing any jury drawn from the ranks of Mississippi's hurricane victims, State Farm could easily ''lose most of the cases,'' Mr. Thompson said. Jury selection began yesterday in federal court in Gulfport for the first trial against State Farm over Katrina damage. That case, which was not part of the settlement talks, was filed by Norman and Genevieve Broussard. Only the foundation slab of their home in Biloxi remained after the hurricane. State Farm refused to pay their claim, saying all the damage was caused by floodwaters. The insurers have already paid $5.2 billion for damage to homes throughout Mississippi for Katrina and $10.3 billion for damage in New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana. To close the deal, State Farm wants the approval of Mississippi's attorney general, Jim Hood, and the state's insurance regulator, George Dale, lawyers close to the talks said. As a condition of the deal, these lawyers said, Mr. Hood would be required to drop a criminal investigation into State Farm's handling of claims as well as a civil lawsuit against State Farm and other insurers. In a statement late yesterday, Mr. Hood said: ''I am working day and night attempting to get our coastal residents a fair shake in the insurance litigation.'' He added, ''It would not help our negotiations to disclose any details at this time.'' Lee Harrell, a deputy to the insurance commissioner, would not comment on the talks but said that the regulators consistently monitored insurance agreements to make sure that they were fair to both policyholders and the insurers. Phil Supple, a spokesman for State Farm, acknowledged that the insurer had been in settlement talks but he said that a final agreement had not yet been reached. ''At this point,'' he said, ''we have no settlement.'' He said State Farm would absolutely like to settle the cases: ''We see it in the best interest of policyholders, the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and State Farm.'' Richard F. Scruggs, who has been leading a team of about a dozen lawyers against State Farm, said that talks toward a settlement began early last fall and that he hoped to see a final agreement this week. ''All the details are finalized,'' he said. The last element, he said, was the approval of the attorney general and the insurance commissioner. ''We are awaiting,'' he said, ''a decision from the state officials who have helped craft the settlement.''"
"In a move that is expected to jump-start rebuilding along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, State Farm Insurance said yesterday that it had reached an agreement with state officials to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to owners of homes along the coast that were wrecked by Hurricane Katrina. The agreement settles lawsuits filed by 640 homeowners and allows thousands of others to reopen damage claims that State Farm previously closed. Insurance executives said they expected the outlines of the deal to be adopted by other carriers. The agreement does not apply to New Orleans, where the failure of the levees left much of the city underwater for days. Lawyers and insurers say no similar settlement talks are in progress there. For State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer and the biggest in Mississippi, the settlement allows for ''a just, speedy and efficient resolution,'' as a spokesman, Phil Supple, put it. It would also remove a major public relations headache. While State Farm and the other insurers may have had some strong legal arguments, they have been widely perceived as insensitive. In many cases, residents whose houses were reduced to concrete slab foundations received just a few thousand dollars in payments. Some received nothing. Under the settlement, 300 homeowners who lost everything will receive their full insurance coverage. Mississippi officials said 1,000 others would receive at least half, with the opportunity to negotiate for more. ''A lot of people on the coast are going to see money in their pockets sooner, rather than have to go through a long, drawn-out process of court proceedings,'' Mississippi's insurance commissioner, George Dale, said yesterday. The core of the dispute was whether the damage to the houses was caused by high winds or surging floodwaters as Hurricane Katrina swept across the coast on Aug. 29, 2005. The insurers said their policies covered only wind damage. But in many cases, they also refused to pay for damage caused by a combination of wind and water. The settlement does not affect the terms of coverage in the insurers' policies, but some insurance experts said they expected that the carriers would ultimately rewrite their policies to specifically bar coverage of damage from storm surges. In the settlement talks, which began last fall, State Farm insisted that the Mississippi attorney general, Jim Hood, drop a criminal investigation of the company's handling of storm damage claims. It also demanded that he abandon a civil suit against it and other insurers. The final sticking point in the agreement had been over the framing of a few sentences that would end the criminal investigation. Mr. Hood convened a grand jury last week that began hearing evidence. The two sides reached agreement in a meeting yesterday afternoon in Jackson, the state capital. Then lawyers for State Farm and Richard F. Scruggs, who represents hundreds of storm victims and played a major role in drafting the settlement, flew to Gulfport on the coast, to seek the endorsement of Judge L. T. Senter Jr., the federal district judge overseeing most of the insurance disputes. Judge Senter had suggested that he would like to see a global settlement, and some participants in the talks said the first money could begin to flow to storm victims as early as next week. Under the agreement, State Farm will pay an initial $130 million and perhaps several hundred million more by the end of the year, depending on how many policyholders requested that their claims be reopened. About 35,000 homeowners along Mississippi's 70-mile-long coast are eligible. Among the homeowners who will benefit from the settlement are Senator Trent Lott and Representative Gene Taylor, both of whom lost their homes in the storm and were denied payment by State Farm. Since Hurricane Katrina struck, the insurance companies have paid $5.3 billion for damage to more than 330,000 homes in Mississippi and $10.3 billion for nearly a million homes in Louisiana. They have raised rates sharply because, they say, the risk of severe storms has increased. They have also refused to renew many policies in vulnerable areas. The settlement disclosed yesterday is expected to have minimum effect on the cost of coverage. State Farm got a vivid picture of the hostility toward it in the first jury trial a little more than a week ago. Judge Senter abruptly declared that State Farm had failed to prove its case and the jury quickly came back with a decision requiring the company to pay $2.5 million in punitive damages to a couple in Biloxi who lost everything in the storm. The judge also awarded the couple the full value of their insurance policy: $223,000. State Farm had maintained that it owed them nothing. Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer at White & Williams in Philadelphia who represents insurance companies, said yesterday that it was clear that the bad publicity had been a big factor in State Farm's decision to settle. ''They spent 80 years building up a brand,'' he said, ''and the adverse publicity from these lawsuits has been clearly doing damage to the brand. It just flies in the face of their portrayal of themselves as good neighbors.'' Indeed, according to people close to the talks, it was State Farm that first suggested a settlement in a telephone call early last fall to Mr. Scruggs, the lawyer. Mr. Scruggs, who came to prominence by filing lawsuits against the tobacco industry, reached an agreement in principle with State Farm two weeks ago. But Mr. Hood, the state attorney general, and Mr. Dale, the insurance commissioner, expressed reservations. Both officials said they wanted to make sure that homeowners got the best possible deal. Mr. Dale, though, said it was also important that any agreement not be overly burdensome for the insurance companies. Mr. Scruggs, whose home in Pascagoula was destroyed along with those of many neighbors, said that resolving the coverage dispute had been ''the most personal and most difficult'' work in his 30-year career. He has not settled with his own insurer. But for his work on the settlement, he will share as much as $46 million with lawyers from half a dozen firms -- to be paid by State Farm on top of its payments to homeowners. In the agreement, State Farm said it would pay $80 million to settle the 640 lawsuits and to reopen, at the request of homeowners, up to 35,000 other claims. The insurance company agreed to pay at least $50 million more on the previously closed claims. Participants in the talks estimated that State Farm could pay a further $250 million to $600 million, depending on how many people reopened claims. For the 300 homes that were swept away, State Farm agreed to pay the full insured value. Those homes were insured for $69,700 to $2.34 million. The owners of the 340 other homes, with varying degrees of damage, are to receive an average of $124,400. In the review of closed claims, homeowners may accept a new offer from State Farm or insist on binding arbitration in hopes of receiving more money. Storm victims are also free to ignore the settlement and file separate lawsuits against State Farm. But few are expected to do so."
"A federal jury ordered State Farm insurance yesterday to pay a $2.5 million penalty for refusing to cover damages to a Mississippi couple's house that was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina, throwing into question settlement talks intended to resolve hundreds of lawsuits filed after the 2005 storm. The eight jurors in Federal District Court in Gulfport, Miss., reached a unanimous decision yesterday less than three hours after Judge L. T. Senter Jr. ruled that State Farm failed to prove that the damage to the house in Biloxi had come from surging floodwaters and, thus, was not covered by the homeowner's policy. Lawyers for the homeowners, Norman and Genevieve Broussard, had argued that the house was knocked off its foundation and torn apart by high winds -- a hazard covered as a fundamental part of home insurance coverage -- and that a wall of water driving in from the Gulf of Mexico had scattered the debris. In a statement from the bench, Judge Senter said that State Farm had presented no ''legal or arguable reason for refusing to pay the plaintiffs' claim,'' Bloomberg News reported. The judge then ordered State Farm to pay the full value of the policy, $233, 292, and told the jury to determine whether the insurer should pay punitive damages and, if so, how much. The homeowners had sought $5 million in addition to their coverage. Yesterday's decision was the first by a jury in a sprawling dispute that sprang up after thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and the insurers were accused of narrowly interpreting coverage and vastly underpaying claims. More than 2,000 lawsuits have been filed. The verdict came as State Farm acknowledged it had started settlement talks with 639 other homeowners in Mississippi. The Broussard lawsuit was not included in those discussions. Those talks continued yesterday amid signs that progress was being made. But, lawyers following the talks said the midafternoon announcement of the $2.5 million verdict was like a lightning strike -- captivating, but not immediately easy to interpret. A spokesman for State Farm, Phil Supple, said the insurer was ''surprised and disappointed'' by yesterday's decision. ''We believe the expert testimony'' of State Farm witnesses ''supported a different result,'' Mr. Supple said, adding that ''an appeal of the decision is likely.'' Mr. Supple acknowledged that State Farm had been sued after it had refused to pay the Broussards anything for their loss. After Hurricane Katrina, State Farm and other insurers balked at paying claims, arguing that much of the damage to houses was caused by flooding, which is not covered by a typical homeowner policy. Many insurers also contended that if any damage to a home had come from water, it nullified the basic coverage for wind damage. Judge Senter agreed in a ruling that the insurers were not obligated to pay for flood damage. But he said that when both wind and water damaged or destroyed a house, it was the burden of the insurance company to prove how much of the loss was because of water and pay for any wind damage. A clerk for Judge Senter said in a telephone interview from Gulfport that experts for State Farm acknowledged in court documents that some damage to the Broussard's home had come from wind. But, he said, ''they did not offer evidence during trial'' showing how much of the damage was from water and how much from wind, as Judge Senter had required. Ultimately, he said, the judge ruled that State Farm was liable for all the damage because the insurer had not provided enough evidence ''the jury could use to segregate'' the wind from the water damage. A lawyer for the homeowners, William C. Walker, said he was ''very pleased with the verdict.'' But he and his partner, Jack Denton, said they had other similar cases pending before Judge Senter and, Mr. Denton said, they did not want to say anything further that might jeopardize them. State Farm would not comment on the impact of the verdict. But lawyers who have been following the talks said they expected strong reactions from the participants that could accelerate the negotiations or to blow them apart. Gary S. Thompson, a Washington lawyer who represents policyholders, said the decision could ''cause all insurers involved to consider seriously a global resolution of all pending claims'' rather than face the chance of heavy punitive damages and critical headlines. The verdict, Mr. Thompson said, could also lead to settlement talks in Louisiana, where hundreds of homeowners have sued insurance companies and no negotiations have yet been reported. But one lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the decision a ''very unsettling'' and ''potentially destabilizing event'' that could drive State Farm from the bargaining table. The jury decision could also lead policyholders to conclude that instead of settling they should hold out in the hope that a jury would award them millions of dollars in punitive damages, said Randy Maniloff, a lawyer in Philadelphia who represents insurance companies. Many lawyers and insurance executives have said in interviews that a settlement by State Farm, the largest insurer in Mississippi and the nation, would probably lead other insurers to follow suit. That would potentially bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the hands of homeowners to start rebuilding. A settlement would probably yield less money than many homeowners thought they could get from a jury, but with the huge number of pending cases, it could be years before they got their day in court. The Mississippi attorney general, Jim Hood, has filed a civil lawsuit against State Farm and other insurers and had began investigating possible criminal charges against State Farm for the way that it handled claims. As a part of the settlement of the 639 lawsuits brought by Richard F. Scruggs and about a dozen other lawyers, the attorney general's lawsuit and criminal investigation would be dropped."
"A grand jury in Mississippi began hearing testimony yesterday on possible criminal charges against State Farm for its handling of claims after Hurricane Katrina, people close to the proceedings said. The start of the grand jury proceedings in the marble circuit courthouse in Pascagoula, on the Gulf Coast, raised new questions about efforts to settle hundreds of lawsuits filed after the storm in 2005. Early last week, State Farm and other participants in the settlement talks said they were close to an agreement that could put hundreds of millions of dollars into the hands of policyholders along the coast who have been waiting for insurance money to begin rebuilding. Several participants in the talks said State Farm wanted to reach agreement before a grand jury began hearing evidence on whether it ordered adjusters and independent engineers to file paperwork that would lead to underpayments to homeowners. As part of the agreement, State Farm was insisting that Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, drop a criminal investigation into the company's handling of claims and call off the grand jury, which would decide whether there was probable cause to return an indictment. But the talks were jolted last Thursday by decisions by a federal judge and jury in Gulfport that awarded a couple in Biloxi $2.7 million, mostly in punitive damages, in a separate lawsuit against State Farm. Lawyers opposing State Farm said they feared that the insurer, the biggest in Mississippi and the nation, would break off the talks. The next day, however, State Farm was back at the table with trial lawyers and Mississippi officials. The negotiations gathered speed throughout the long holiday weekend, and some participants thought an agreement might be announced as early as Tuesday. But, according to several participants, Mr. Hood refused to sign off on the deal. That enabled the grand jury to be seated in Pascagoula. It also meant that another of State Farm's conditions was not met: A requirement that Mr. Hood also drop a civil lawsuit against it and other insurers. When the grand jury began hearing testimony yesterday, participants in the talks said, State Farm lawyers seemed on the verge of ending the negotiations. But in a brief interview late yesterday, Phil Supple, a spokesman for State Farm, said that the insurer continued ''talking with all parties'' and remained optimistic a settlement could be reached. As for the grand jury proceedings, Mr. Supple said State Farm ''is cooperating fully with the attorney general's grand jury investigation.'' He would not confirm reports that one witness had been Terry Blalock, State Farm's senior claims executive in Mississippi. In late summer, two independent adjusters provided evidence to Mississippi officials that they said supported claims of impropriety against State Farm. The two adjusters contended that State Farm destroyed large numbers of documents related to their payments for Hurricane Katrina damage. State Farm has insisted that it did nothing wrong. An aide to Mr. Hood said late Wednesday that he was in a meeting and could not speak with a reporter. Lawyers and others who have been following the settlement talks and the claims disputes with insurers along the Mississippi coast, where tens of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed by high wind and surging floodwaters, said several witnesses went before the grand jury yesterday."
"DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER was president and global warming was unheard of in 1960 when Congress authorized a massive storm-protection project for an 83-mile stretch of Long Island's South Shore, from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point. Now, after decades of false starts and shelved plans, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has completed a study for the project and is discussing alternatives for proceeding with a long list of government agencies. What may emerge would be the largest shoreline resculpturing project undertaken in this country, costing hundreds of millions of dollars yet still incapable of protecting barrier islands and the South Shore mainland from devastation should a monster hurricane strike, officials involved with the project say. The project would be designed to last for 50 years, and the Army Corps and others are grappling with how much they should factor in the rise in sea level projected by many experts because of global warming. Work would probably not begin until 2010, 50 years after it was first authorized. The study now looks only at water levels over the past century. But that may change, the corps said, and the study could be expanded to consider the environmental and economic impacts of a storm in the class of Hurricane Katrina and what is now seen as the higher probability of such a storm's striking Long Island. While building a towering seawall the entire 83-mile length would be all that could help in severe storms, no shoreline armoring is on the table. At its most aggressive limits, the project would move mountains of sand, build dune lines, broaden beaches, jigger with inlets and set policy for what to do when breaches open in the barrier islands. The plan will also most likely call for reinforcing houses and other structures in flood-prone areas, removing them or moving them to safer ground. All the efforts will be to reduce storm, erosion and flooding damage to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in a 71-square-mile area reaching as far inland as Montauk Highway and Sunrise Highway. Clifford S. Jones of the corps' New York district office, who is the reformulation project manager, said a yearlong process of reaching consensus on the best way forward had begun. He said the public would get its first inkling of what may be in store at meetings toward the end of this year or soon after. ''We are winnowing down the alternatives to come up with something the corps, the state, the federal agencies, Suffolk County and the towns and villages can all agree on,'' Mr. Jones said. ''And that's going to be a huge effort.'' The corps was accused of failing to build levees properly in New Orleans, where flooding and ruin after Katrina in 2005 have changed how the corps will proceed with future projects. Corps officials will seek broad public support and scrutiny of a final plan for Long Island's South Shore. They will also submit that plan and the studies supporting it to an outside agency, which has yet to be selected, for an independent technical review. The study -- formally the Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study (the ''reformulation'' is from a plan rejected in 1978) -- calculates impacts from postulated storms and hurricanes and the protection that a variety of projects could provide. The project area, entirely in Suffolk County, encompasses ocean and bay shores and some 70 percent of Long Island's ocean beaches. It includes the 26-mile Fire Island National Seashore and its summer communities; parts of the Towns of Babylon, Islip, Brookhaven, Southampton and East Hampton; and incorporated villages. On Fire Island, no plan can be approved without the consent of the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the National Park Service and its Fire Island National Seashore. In the past, the corps, the Fire Island summer communities and the seashore have had very different views on what is best for the beaches. A ''vision statement'' that the seashore regards as a road map for any project calls for natural processes like shifting sand to be unimpeded as much as possible and for dune and long-term beach replenishment to be minimized. The seashore is also determined that no project be tailored to benefit property owners who want their houses protected. Michael T. Reynolds, the seashore superintendent, said ''there will be a variety of trade-offs that will need to be made, with winners and losers both.'' The Fire Island Association, a property owners' group, will want assurances that the project will protect the beaches fronting summer communities. Doing that, it argues, will be cheaper than paying to remove houses. Traditionally the federal government pays about 65 percent of the cost of shoreline projects. The state, Suffolk County and local governments would split the rest. If agreement can be reached on what to do along the entire 83 miles of shore, another challenge will be financing, said Representative Timothy H. Bishop, a Democrat from Southampton. ''That fight will be difficult,'' he said, ''and it's difficult to know what other fiscal realities we may be facing.'' Mr. Bishop said he did not expect an appropriation before 2010. ''If we're still in Iraq then, that may well have an impact,'' he said. Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat of Dix Hills, said he had assurances that the corps would release a preliminary draft by the end of 2007 and a proposed final action plan by the end of 2008. ''We are beginning to see the light at the end of a 40-year tunnel,'' he said, ''but like all dark tunnels, you don't know what you have got until you come out.'' SHIFTING SAND"
"Over the years, many people have tried to simulate the winds of hurricanes and measure the effects. They have set up model wind tunnels. They have used the equivalent of airbags to simulate wind gusts. They have even used jet engines. But according to Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University, it can be difficult to get real-life results if your wind tunnel is so small you have to scale buildings down to the size of a birdhouse. ''You can't scale gravity,'' Dr. Leatherman said. ''You can't scale shingles and learn about how they are failing.'' So he and his colleagues are ''bringing the hurricane into the lab,'' as he put it, with an array of two fans, each 17 feet in diameter with a 1,000-horsepower-plus motor. The machine also has a water feature, to reproduce the effects of storm-driven rain. Financed by the State of Florida, the equipment can produce 120-mile-per-hour winds -- the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. The goal is to use the machine to determine with precision how buildings fail during storms. Scientists have long drawn conclusions about storm survivability by surveying wreckage and noting which buildings fell and which stood. ''But when you see a building that's torn apart,'' said Dr. Leatherman, who has done such surveys, ''you can't always see why it failed.'' At a weather conference last month in Nassau, Bahamas, Dr. Leatherman said he and his colleagues hoped to use the fans to see which components in a typical house fail first, how the failure of one component affects the stability of others, and what kind of retrofitting would improve things. At the conference, he played a film showing the effects of the fan array on a modest house: As the fans started to whir, shingles flew off the roof, windows shattered and the door blew open. ''We put tape on the windows,'' he recalled. ''That was useless. Wind flow blew the windows out. It started blowing furniture around. We ran it with the water on: at 10 minutes at 100 miles per hour, the paint was bubbling. A couple days later we came back and there was mold all over the place.'' With additional financing from RenaissanceRe, a reinsurance firm in Bermuda, Dr. Leatherman is hoping to create a six-fan wall of wind, to simulate even more devastating effects."
"When people worry about the effects of global warming, they worry more about hurricanes than anything else. In surveys, almost three-quarters of Americans say there will be more and stronger hurricanes in a warming world. By contrast, fewer than one-quarter worry about increased coastal flooding. But as far as the scientific consensus is concerned, people have things just about backward. There is no doubt that as the world warms, seas will rise, increasing the flood risk, simply because warmer water occupies more space. (And if the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets melt, the rise will be far greater.) It seems similarly logical that as the world warms, hurricanes will be more frequent or more powerful or both. After all, they draw their strength from warm ocean waters. But while many scientists hold this view, there is far less consensus, in part because of new findings on other factors that may work against stronger, more frequent storms. ''Global warming is as real as it gets,'' Richard A. Anthes, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, said last month at a weather conference in the Bahamas, where most of the conversation focused on hurricanes. But as for its link to hurricanes, Mr. Anthes said, ''I don't think it's been proved conclusively.'' In a consensus statement issued last year, the World Meteorological Organization said it was likely that there would be some increase in hurricane wind speeds in a warmer world. But the organization, which is the United Nations weather agency, noted that decades-long periods of high and low hurricane activity, unconnected to any climate change, had been recorded before. (Climate experts say a period of high activity began in 1995.) Also, measurement techniques have greatly improved in recent decades, making it difficult to compare data and detect trends. So as the annual hurricane season begins on June 1, scientists are pressing on a number of fronts to learn how hurricanes form and move, what factors limit or expand their lethal potential and how to tell with greater precision when and where they will strike. Perhaps the best known proponent of the idea that warming and hurricanes may be connected is Kerry A. Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His conclusion that the total power released in Atlantic and western Pacific hurricanes had increased perhaps by half in recent decades, reported in 2005 in the journal Nature, is one of the most discussed ideas in the debate. He is not alone. Last year, researchers led by Carlos D. Hoyos of the Georgia Institute of Technology analyzed the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms, the most powerful, and concluded that their increased frequency since 1970 was ''directly linked to the trend in sea-surface temperature,'' which is increasing. They reported their findings in the journal Science. Other experts challenge the idea that a warmer world means more and stronger storms. For example, researchers at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Miami have been studying how vertical wind shear -- the differences in wind direction or speed at different altitudes -- can inhibit hurricane formation. In work reported last month in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers said that in a warming world, wind shear in the Atlantic would increase, possibly enough to cancel out the hurricane-forcing effects of warmer water. Last week, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts reported in the journal Nature that periods of frequent storminess had occurred in the past, even though things were cooler than they are now. They also concluded that wind currents were a crucial factor. But even these researchers call the question open. ''This doesn't settle the issue,'' said Gabriel Vecchi, the lead author of the wind shear study and a research scientist at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, in Princeton, N.J. In February, researchers led by James Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin, recalibrated recent and early satellite data on hurricanes using information from the National Climatic Data Center, a NOAA archive in Asheville, N.C. They concluded that hurricane frequency had increased, but only in the Atlantic, possibly because temperatures there are chronically just about warm enough for storms; so even modest warming makes hurricanes more likely. But when Christopher W. Landsea analyzed historical records of hurricane activity, he concluded that satellite observations and other new techniques had increased scientists' ability to detect major storms, skewing the frequency data. Dr. Landsea, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, reported this conclusion this month in EOS, an electronic publication of the American Geophysical Union. This kind of he-said-he-said debate often leads people to dismiss a subject as one about which nothing will ever be known with confidence. In fact, the give and take is an example of the way scientists tug and haul at their own and others' findings until a consensus takes shape. In the current debate over global warming and hurricanes, the problem is relatively new and the data are hard to obtain and analyze. For example, atmospheric researchers are wrestling with an enormous amount of new data as they study factors that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the hurricane's characteristic eye and the bands of wind and rain that howl around it. They hope to use the data to better predict how strong hurricanes will be when they strike land. But the effort is complicated by the way storms gain or lose strength as they move over warm or cool water, and by the way their structures evolve. The researchers studied the movement of air, moisture and heat energy as a hurricane's inner eyewall degrades, and the way an outer band can move in to replace it. Baseing their conclusions on aircraft, satellite and ground observations during Hurricanes Katrina, Ophelia and Rita in 2005, the researcher, led by Robert A. Houze Jr. of the University of Washington, reported their eyewall findings in the journal Science in March. Forecasting storm tracks is easier, because they are generally determined by large-scale wind patterns that are relatively easy to observe by satellite and aircraft. But the ease of prediction is relative. Forecasters still worry, many of them obsessively, about the difficulty of providing landfall forecasts with few false alarms, in time for escape from threatened areas. One question meteorologists and climate experts can answer quickly is an obvious one: What happened to the hurricane season of 2006? Viewed from the perspective of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, it was a bust (or a boon). Not a single hurricane struck the United States. But last year a persistent Bermuda high, sitting unusually far out in the Atlantic, and air currents from an unexpected and quick-forming El Niño system, which developed in the Pacific in August, diminished the storms' potential to strike the United States. As a result, it felt like a year with no storms, even though there were only slightly fewer named storms than average (9 instead of 11), about as many became hurricanes as on average (5 instead of 6) and, as in an ordinary year, 2 hurricanes with winds of more than 111 miles per hour, the standard for Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. This year, we will probably not be so lucky, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said at a news conference last week. They said they expected 13 to 17 named storms this season, 7 to 10 of them hurricanes and 3 to 5 of them major storms. The first of the named storms, Andrea, formed off the southeast coast in mid-May, more than three weeks before the season's official start. No matter what happens this year, and no matter how the debate over global warming and hurricanes is resolved, there is wide agreement that residents of the East and Gulf Coasts can expect harsh treatment from storms, possibly for decades. So even scientists who disagree on the hurricane-and-warming question agree that people should be discouraged from putting themselves in harm's way. In a statement issued at this time last year, Dr. Anthes, Dr. Emanuel, Dr. Landsea and other researchers said the main hurricane problem facing the United States was ''the ever-growing concentration of population and wealth in vulnerable coastal areas,'' much of it subsidized by federal insurance and other programs. ''We are optimistic that continued research will eventually resolve much of the current controversy over the effect of climate change on hurricanes,'' the scientists added. ''But the more urgent problem of our lemminglike march to the sea requires immediate and sustained attention.'' This idea is nothing new. The United States Commission on Ocean Policy made the point in its 2004 report, and many scientists have long advocated for more and better coastal hazard mapping, building restrictions and other steps to discourage development in high-risk areas. But as several NOAA officials noted at their news conference last week, 53 percent of Americans live within 50 miles of a coast. The polling data on public perceptions about global warming were presented May 5 in a conference at the John F. Kennedy School of Government by Robert J. Blendon, executive director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program. The conference focused on looming crises in which governments and other institutions seem unwilling to act. But anyone who listened to the NOAA news conference last week might be forgiven for concluding that it is already too late. Although Gerry Bell, a lead forecaster at the National Hurricane Center, and Xavier William Proenza, the center's director, pointed with obvious pride to the agency's ever-improving forecasting ability, and agency officials cited new disaster-planning efforts, they and others acknowledged that even the best forecasts could do little to prevent property damage in a major hurricane. Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, said people living in vulnerable coastal areas should stockpile enough food and water to last at least 72 hours. ''Your state and federal responders -- they will not be there instantly when a hurricane arrives,'' he said. Correction: June 2, 2007, Saturday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the possibility that global warming could lead to an increase in hurricanes misstated part of the name of an organization that studies hurricane formation. It is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, not ''Oceanographic.''"
"Stand atop any levee in the New Orleans area, and one question will offer itself, unbidden, to the mind: Is this pile of dirt tall enough to stand up to the next storm? The answer is complex, and a wary city has been waiting to hear it. After the New Orleans hurricane protection system failed under the onslaught of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Army Corps of Engineers rethought the way it assesses hurricane risk. It devised new, flexible computer models and ran countless simulations on Defense Department supercomputers to help it understand what kind of storms the region can expect, how the current protection system might perform against them, and what defenses will be needed in the future. Skeptics say the corps has bitten off more than its supercomputers can chew. And in fact, the effort to produce what the corps calls its risk and reliability report has long passed its original deadline of June 1, 2006. Last week, its publication was delayed yet again, into mid-June. If all goes as planned, the color-coded maps and tables in the report will also help residents know whether their living rooms are likely to be wet or dry in the storms to come -- and even whether they want to commit to staying in their city or pull up stakes. Ed Link, director of the official corps investigation into the levee failures and a professor of engineering at the University of Maryland, said that while ''everyone's frustrated with how long it's taken, especially us,'' the agency would deliver the report only ''when we have confidence that it's the right information.'' ''Misinformation is a whole lot worse than no information,'' Dr. Link said. The new methods employed by the corps have already been adopted by the other government agencies most interested in hurricanes and flooding: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the National Flood Insurance Program and will use the data in its flood maps. It is the first time all three agencies have agreed on a common method of assessing such risks for the Gulf Coast. Eventually, Dr. Link suggested, it may be used by all of them nationwide. The corps has all but completed the initial work of patching the damage done to the network of levees, floodwalls, gates and pumps. But as some work continues, there has been a lull in moving on to the next major step: raising the level of protection to meet the challenge of a 100-year storm, the kind of hurricane that might have a 1-in-100 chance of occurring in any given year. The new report will provide the estimates of the kind of storms that could be expected at intervals of up to 500 years, and the damage and flooding they can be expected to produce. And it will help to develop proposals for protection systems against the strongest storms. The report is an important prelude to the design process. Walter O. Baumy Jr., the chief of the engineering division for the New Orleans district of the corps, said the agency had not been sitting around waiting for the report, but had been designing structures for the next round of building based on the best estimates available. If necessary, he went on, the designs will be altered ''when those numbers get finalized.'' Col. Jeffrey A. Bedey, commander of the corps' Hurricane Protection Office in New Orleans, said the extra time had allowed the corps to learn from the mistakes of the past. ''There's a tremendous opportunity,'' he said, ''to show this isn't the same old corps.'' No one disputes that the old way of doing business did not work. The New Orleans levees and floodwalls were built to withstand a hypothetical storm called the standard project hurricane, a model developed with the Weather Bureau beginning in 1959 and based largely on data drawn from previous storms. The standard project hurricane was a hypothetical construct that may have been the state of the art at the time, but is ''very simplistic'' by today's standards, Dr. Link said. The old model was limited by the shortage of data on older storms and is essentially a static set of values, Dr. Link said, adding, ''You pull a hurricane out of a box and you stick it down at landfall.'' That did not show the complex behavior of a real storm, which produces surge and waves that have profound effects on coastal areas in the days before it actually hits land. After Hurricane Katrina, an outside panel from the American Society of Civil Engineers pushed the corps to come up with a new system based less on history than on the broader range of statistical probabilities -- the kind of tools commonly used today to determine, for example, how a building will fare in an earthquake. ''Without a statistically valid approach'' to evaluating risk that goes beyond the old methods, the panel wrote to the corps in March 2006, ''no rational hurricane protection system can result.'' The chairman, David E. Daniel, president of the University of Texas at Dallas, said the effort ''may well represent the most complex risk analysis ever undertaken for a major metropolitan area.'' The work has been done under the supervision of Donald T. Resio at the corps' Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg, Miss. Dr. Resio, a computer scientist with a sunny, professional air, works in the ephemeral world of code and screens in a place that has its roots in soil, steel and concrete. He had been working on long-term risk assessment projects with NOAA and FEMA and academic and industry experts when the storms came, and he approached the leadership of the corps and offered to adapt the work his team had been doing to the urgent task at hand. ''I went to headquarters,'' he recalled, ''and said, 'If you want this done right, this is how it can be done.' '' He recalled saying something else as well: ''I told them, 'It's difficult; it's tedious.' '' Since then, he said, ''we've been burning 80-, 100-hour weeks for so long we've lost track of them.'' The model uses chains of computer programs, each feeding into the other some of the data from historical storms and hypothetical future storms, setting up ranges of intensity, size, path, forward speed and other variables. These factors, blended together, produce data on the kinds of wind, storm surge and waves that can be expected to strike the shore, and how much rain can be expected. All of those elements of the model are then applied to the digital re-creations of local geography and the man-made structures of the region. Now, Dr. Resio said, ''we have come miles this year in our understanding of hurricane behavior and hurricane probability in the Gulf of Mexico.'' Dr. Link said the group had found, for example, that storms in the Gulf do not behave randomly and come to shore anywhere, but are likeliest to follow certain sets of paths -- with New Orleans getting more than a random share of storms. And though much hurricane analysis relies on the handy Saffir-Simpson scale of storm strength, the size of a storm can be as important as its intensity in producing surge and waves. Despite its destructiveness, Katrina was just a Category 3 storm when it hit Mississippi, with winds that hit New Orleans only in the range of Category 1 or 2, but because it was more powerful when it was farther out in the Gulf, it generated a battering surge near 30 feet in some areas. Most important, Dr. Link said, the new method lays the groundwork for finding the best way to protect a coast, and moves away from the old habit of evaluating projects largely on the basis of cost-benefit analysis. He added that the model was flexible enough to incorporate new information in the future, as global climate change affects hurricanes. The biggest remaining question about the effort, however, is whether it will be accurate. Much of the delay has come down to attempts to reduce the levels of uncertainty throughout the series of calculations. Robert S. Young, a coastal geologist at Western Carolina University, said the project, while worthy, would not succeed because there is still precious little data on the behavior of storms in the Gulf. Given the variability of nature, he said, devising a predictive model ''is nearly impossible.'' ''All of the modeling and prediction they're doing is just guesswork,'' he went on. ''I'm not sure that is better than nothing.'' Orrin H. Pilkey, an emeritus professor of geology at Duke University, said ''undue confidence in these models'' could lead to a false sense of security about the hurricane protection system. Dr. Link acknowledges that it is hard to come up with meaningful data but says it is important to try. ''You can wring your hands and say, 'Woe is me!,' '' he said, or ''use the best projections that you can and try to inform yourself.'' The dispute is familiar to anyone who works in the world of complex computer modeling. Francine Berman, director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center, said the data should be rich, the model should be accurate and the computer should be powerful to provide truly useful information that can be validated. ''At the end of the day, a bad model is just interesting math,'' she said. ''These complex models are incredibly hard to get right. The first time out, it's very unlikely that you're going to get an accurate enough model, but you have to start with the best representational model you can come up with and iteratively improve it over years, decades -- even centuries.'' An enormous amount of the recent work of the risk and reliability team has been translating the data into a form that the average person can understand. Donald E. Powell, President Bush's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding, said in an interview that he tells corps officials, ''Put it in language my mama can understand.'' But the ultimate message is likely to be that despite the billions of dollars being spent to improve hurricane protection for New Orleans, it remains a city in the cross hairs for dangerous storms. Dr. Daniel, the University of Texas at Dallas president, said, ''It doesn't take a sophisticated risk analysis tool to say it's a risky place.''"
"Over the last 5,000 years, the eastern Caribbean has experienced several periods, lasting centuries, in which strong hurricanes occurred frequently even though ocean temperatures were cooler than those measured today, according to a new study. The authors, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, say their findings do not necessarily conflict with recent papers asserting a link between the region's hurricane activity and human-caused warming of the climate and seas. But, they say, their work does imply that factors other than ocean temperature, at least for thousands of years, appear to have played a pivotal role in shaping storminess in the region. The study compared a 5,000-year record of strong storms etched in lagoon mud on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques with data on ocean temperatures and climate and storm patterns. The analysis is being published today in the journal Nature. The Woods Hole team found that stormier spans, including one from 1700 until now, were associated with a relative paucity of El Niño warm-ups of the tropical Pacific Ocean and also with periods of heightened monsoon intensity in West Africa. El Niño episodes tend to change wind patterns in ways that weaken Atlantic Ocean hurricanes, and Africa is a nursery for storm fronts that can drift westward and develop into hurricanes. Storm records extracted from sediments on the Gulf Coast by other scientists, and near New York City by the Woods Hole team, show a similar pattern, implying that the shifts from quieter to stormier times are not just a local phenomenon, the authors said. Jeffrey P. Donnelly, the lead author, said the findings pointed to the importance of figuring out an unresolved puzzle: whether global warming will affect the Niño cycle one way or the other. More intense or longer Pacific warm-ups could stifle Atlantic and Caribbean hurricanes even with warmer seas, Dr. Donnelly said. ''Warm sea-surface temperatures are clearly the fuel for intense hurricanes,'' he said. ''What our work says is that without sea temperatures varying a lot, the climate system can flip back and forth between active and inactive regimes.'' He added that a disturbing possibility was a warming of waters while conditions in the Pacific and Africa are in their hurricane-nurturing mode. ''If you flip that knob and also have warming seas,'' Dr. Donnelly said, ''oh boy, who knows what could happen?'' Judith A. Curry, an atmospheric scientist at Georgia Tech, said the new study, together with other recent research on warming and storms by her and others, added to a picture of rising risk and lagging government action on reducing vulnerability of coastal populations in the Atlantic and Caribbean hurricane zone. ''The bottom line is that we are in an unusually active period of hurricane activity, as a result of a combination of natural variability and global warming,'' Dr. Curry said. ''Analyses have been done, plans have been put on the table, but nothing seems to be happening.''"
"The tornado that suddenly destroyed Greensburg, Kan., earlier this month was another reminder of why Americans need to be concerned that so much of the National Guard and its equipment is now deployed far from home -- in Iraq, Afghanistan and along the Mexican border. Fortunately, Kansas still had enough Guard members for rescue and cleanup in a town of less than 2,000 people. But if the next disaster is a Category 5 hurricane, a terrorist attack or a nationwide flu epidemic, we fear the Guard will not be ready. Congress needs to speed its efforts to rebuild the Guard's capacity. While more federal money cannot bring Guard members back home, it can accelerate the replacement of lost equipment and pay for disaster response training. The National Guard is America's primary first response force. It can be mobilized quickly. It is under the command of state governors. And unlike federal military forces, which are not supposed to engage in local law enforcement, it can step in smoothly where needed to preserve public order. But because the Army is so overstretched, more than 25,000 National Guard troops are now serving in Iraq, and that number is expected to rise significantly as part of President Bush's troop buildup. Nearly 5,000 are in Afghanistan and roughly 6,000 are stationed along the Mexican border. Because of equipment left behind in Iraq and Afghanistan, domestically based Guard units have only 40 percent of the equipment they need for disaster response. Nearly 90 percent of stateside Guard units are rated less than fully ready because of equipment and training shortfalls. In the days immediately after 9/11, Air National Guard fighter jets provided extra air cover over New York, and units from the District of Columbia National Guard helped out in Washington. But that was before Iraq. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, roughly 35 percent of the Louisiana National Guard, and 40 percent of the Mississippi contingent, were in Iraq. Federal troops and Guard units from other states helped fill the gap. But it's not hard to imagine situations where waiting for out-of-state responders will cost lives, particularly if a disaster also hits neighboring states. In a year when Congress will be authorizing more than half a trillion dollars in national security spending, there is no excuse for keeping the National Guard on perilously short rations. Editorial"
"THE recent heavy storms that left downtown Manville, N.J., under 10 feet of water; filled the basements of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; and flooded rivers and downed power lines in Connecticut may have provided a glimpse of our future. Climate change is accelerating, and the prognosis for the region is alarming, as it is for the rest of the world. No matter how effectively we begin to curb our greenhouse-gas emissions now, we are destined to see significant climate changes because these gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time. We cannot delay planning for the environmental and human calamities that lie ahead. All over the world, according to the 2007 scientific report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ''it is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent.'' But we need look no further than our own backyard to find evidence of warming. Since 1950, average summer temperatures in New York City have increased by seven-tenths of a degree per decade, but for the last 20 years, by more than two degrees per decade. By the middle of this century, with both temperature and humidity rising, the regional climate will resemble that of today's Maryland, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. And by 2100, if greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase at the present rate, New York's heat index could resemble that of northern Georgia, with 60 or more days above 90 degrees and 25 days at over 100 (we now average just two days over 100 a year). Average sea temperature off our coast has risen by more than two degrees since 1979, and by 2100 it will be four to eight degrees higher. These rising water temperatures will likely lead to stronger and more damaging storms. In 1954, when Hurricane Carol passed over Long Island and hit Connecticut, the tidal surge at New London was 10 feet high. Many scientists feel it is only a matter of time until a truly devastating hurricane makes a direct hit on New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. Nicholas K. Coch, a hurricane expert at Queens College, predicts that a Category 3 hurricane (the strength of Hurricane Katrina when it hit Louisiana) making landfall just west of the Hudson River Estuary would result in a greatly amplified storm surge, owing to the piling up of coastal waters in the almost right angle formed by the New Jersey and Long Island shores. Surge levels would rise to 20 feet at the Statue of Liberty and more than 26 feet in Jamaica Bay. This would cause extensive flooding of the New Jersey shore, Staten Island and Lower Manhattan, the Rockaways and Coney Island, southern Brooklyn, much of Queens, part of Long Island City and Astoria, and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and continue on to the Westchester shore. Rising sea levels will only intensify such storm surges. In the past 100 years, while the global sea level has risen by four to eight inches, water levels in New York Harbor have risen by about a foot, and they are expected to rise five more inches by 2030. Without any controls on greenhouse-gas emissions, the sea level could rise as much as three and a half feet by 2080, Columbia University scientists estimate. These predictions and actual experience are already depressing property values in low-lying areas and making it more difficult for some homeowners in flood-prone areas to get insurance. As climate change progresses, the economic impact will only increase. Facing up to climate-driven perils will require comprehensive regional planning. We might consider, for example, ceasing government payments for storm damage to buildings in flood zones. This would gradually reduce and ultimately eliminate housing from the shoreline in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. If we were to replace the housing with restored wetlands and woodland parks at the water's edge, it would help stabilize the coastline. New sea walls in Lower Manhattan might help protect the city from the high waves created by future hurricanes. We don't presume to know all of the precautions that will be required, nor their priority and timing, and no one else knows either. What is needed is an international institute, centered in New York, where leaders of the world's great cities along with urban planners, environmental scientists, economists and various other experts can put their knowledge together to prepare for future climate change. We must begin to imagine what may happen, and start investing now, to keep the region safe for this century. Op-Ed Contributors George R.

"Some of the most celebrated levee repairs by the Army Corps of Engineers after Hurricane Katrina are already showing signs of serious flaws, a leading critic of the corps says. The critic, Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said he encountered several areas of concern on a tour in March. The most troubling, Dr. Bea said, was erosion on a levee by the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation canal that helped channel water into New Orleans during the storm. Breaches in that 13-mile levee devastated communities in St. Bernard Parish, just east of New Orleans, and the rapid reconstruction of the barrier was hailed as one of the corps' most significant rebuilding achievements in the months after the storm. But Dr. Bea, an author of a blistering 2006 report on the levee failures paid for by the National Science Foundation, said erosion furrows, or rills, suggest that ''the risks are still high.'' Heavy storms, he said, may cause ''tear-on-the-dotted-line levees.'' Dr. Bea examined the hurricane protection system at the request of National Geographic magazine, which is publishing photographs of the levee and an article on his concerns about the levee and other spots on its Web site at ngm.com/levees. Corps officials argue that Dr. Bea is overstating the risk and say that they will reinspect elements of the levee system he has identified and fix problems they find. The disagreement underscores the difficulty of evaluating risk in hurricane protection here, where even dirt is a contentious issue. And discussing safety in a region still struggling with a 2005 disaster requires delicacy. Hurricane season begins again next month. The most revealing of the photographs, taken from a helicopter, looks out from the levee across the navigation canal and a skinny strip of land to the expanses of Lake Borgne. From the grassy crown of the levee, small, wormy patterns of rills carved by rain make their way down the landward side, widening at the base into broad fissures that extend beyond the border of the grass. Dr. Bea, who was recently appointed to an expert committee for plaintiffs' lawyers in federal suits against the government and private contractors over Hurricane Katrina losses, said that he could not be certain the situation was dangerous without further inspection and that he wanted to avoid what he called ''cry wolf syndrome.'' But, he added, he does not want to ignore ''potentially important early warning signs.'' He praised the corps for much of the work it had done since the storm, but he added that the levee should be armored with rock or concrete against overtopping, a move the corps has rejected in the short term. Another expert who has viewed the photographs, J. David Rogers, called the images ''troubling.'' Dr. Rogers, who holds the Karl F. Hasselmann chair in geological engineering at the University of Missouri-Rolla, said it would take more work, including an analysis of the levee soils, to determine whether there was a possibility of catastrophic failure. But he said his first thought upon viewing the images was, ''That won't survive another Katrina.'' Dr. Rogers worked on the 2006 report on levee failures with Dr. Bea. John M. Barry, a member of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East who has also seen the photographs, also expressed worry. ''If Bea and Rogers are concerned, then I'm concerned,'' he said. Mr. Barry, the author of ''Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America,'' said it was important to seek balance when discussing the levees in the passionately charged environment of New Orleans since the storm. ''I don't want anybody to have any false confidence'' in the system, he said. ''On the other hand, if things are improving, people need to know that, too. And things have been improving.'' After being informed of the safety questions, Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, prepared a letter to send today to the corps commander, Lt. Gen. Carl A. Strock, asking whether the work by the corps was sufficient to protect the levee system. At the corps, Richard J. Varuso, the assistant chief of the geotechnical branch of the district's engineering division, said that some erosion could be expected after a levee was constructed. ''If it rains, we get some rutting,'' Mr. Varuso said, adding that as vegetation grows in, the levee ''heals itself.'' Walter O. Baumy Jr., the chief of the engineering division for the New Orleans district of the corps, said the new levees were made with dense, clay-rich soil that would resist erosion. Although the stretches of the St. Bernard levee that were still standing after the storm are composed of more porous soils dredged from the nearby canal, Mr. Baumy said a reinforcing clay layer on top some 10 feet thick would keep the fissures from reaching the weaker soils. Still, he said that ''we will take a look at this'' and that the corps would make repairs where necessary. Dr. Bea, who wrangled with the corps last year about construction standards on the same levee, countered that recent work in the Netherlands suggested that clay-capped levees with a porous core, which are common, were prone to failure in high water. Another official who viewed the photographs, Robert A. Turner Jr., the executive director of the Lake Borgne basin levee district, east of New Orleans, said he was concerned, but not necessarily alarmed, about the rills toward the crown of the St. Bernard levee, calling them a common sight on new levees in the area. Mr. Turner said he was more concerned by the images of larger ruts toward the base of the levee, and said of the corps, ''We're just going to keep on them.'' Mr. Turner said the corps had been responsive to issues raised by local officials. ''They're out there trying to prove to everybody under the sun that they built everything correctly,'' he said. ''That is a big departure from the way the corps used to operate pre-Katrina,'' he said, but added: ''They got so much negative publicity before, they can't afford to do it wrong. They've got to do it right.''"
"The severe drought in South Florida had an upside for state water management officials who took advantage of the low water levels in Lake Okeechobee and began giving the lake bed a good cleaning. At an almost record low of 9.2 feet, the lake's water level exposed areas where oozy and polluted muck sediment containing decomposed organic matter had accumulated, covering most of the lake bed at depths of more than a foot. Officials from the South Florida Water Management District brought in bulldozers and dump trucks to several sites around the lake on Thursday to scrape the muck and expose the natural bottom in an effort to promote the regrowth of submerged aquatic vegetation and shoreline marshes, which had been suffering since the active 2004 hurricane season. The hurricanes that hit the state in 2004 and 2005 stirred up the muck, keeping sunlight from plants and lowering water clarity in the 730-square-mile lake. In just one site, water management officials expect to take about three months to dredge out 500,000 cubic yards of muck from 800 acres of lake bed. ''This is the silver lining to a drought condition,'' said Susan Gray, Lake Okeechobee program director at the South Florida Water Management District. ''It's a mixed blessing because we have to deal with the drought, but in terms of the lake itself, it's beneficial.'' The removal will also improve fish habitat by exposing the sandy areas that fish need to lay their eggs, Dr. Gray said. Earlier this month, the agency's governing board approved more than $11 million for the project, which is expected to remove a total of 3.8 million cubic yards of muck and 280 tons of phosphorous. The excavated material will be encircled by a berm along a nearby canal before its disposal is coordinated with local landowners who have expressed interest in using it, Dr. Gray said. The agency conducted a similar muck-removal project during the 2001 drought, when the lake's water level dropped below nine feet, the record low. Florida is facing one of its worst droughts ever recorded, with 41 inches of rain having fallen across the southern half of the state over the last year, more than 10 inches below the average."
"State and local governments in Gulf Coast areas devastated by the 2005 hurricanes will no longer be required to pay 10 percent of the cost of repairing their roads, schools and other public works, under a provision of the emergency war spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday night. Louisiana officials had said that the need to cover some of the repair costs themselves, instead of having the federal government assume all costs, was significantly slowing their recovery efforts. They praised Congress for making the change, which they estimated would save the state and its affected communities at least $775 million. Mississippi will also benefit from the change, to a lesser degree. The Bush administration had earlier opposed lifting the requirement, but after long and intense negotiations with Congress over the much larger provision financing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the president signed the bill yesterday. ''We are thrilled,'' Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said in a telephone interview. The exemption, Ms. Blanco said, will particularly help local governments crippled by the storms. In addition to the direct financial advantage, the waiver will reduce the paperwork that local governments must complete to get federal financing for infrastructure, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. That in itself will save some money, and will also hasten rebuilding. ''This definitely puts the foot down on the accelerator in terms of speeding up the recovery,'' Mr. Kopplin said. Under a law enacted by Congress in 1988, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can pay for 90 percent of infrastructure repairs after significant natural disasters. The requirement that state and local governments match that by paying the other 10 percent was intended to prevent fraud and waste by giving them a financial stake in their own projects. Louisiana intends to use money freed by the new waiver to help shore up its federally financed program helping homeowners rebuild their houses. That program, called the Road Home, is facing an eventual shortfall of about $2.9 billion, according to state estimates. More families have applied than the state anticipated, and have qualified for higher-than-expected grants. New Orleans has been counting on the waiver to help pay for its own rebuilding plan. Mayor C. Ray Nagin issued a statement yesterday saying the city was very pleased with the exemption, which he called critical to recovery. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, had made a concerted effort to get Congress to waive the 10 percent requirement. Ms. Landrieu was able to get a waiver included in a previous version of the war spending bill as well, but that measure was vetoed by President Bush because of its troop-withdrawal timetable. Although the federal government eliminated the payment requirement after past disasters like Sept. 11 and Hurricane Andrew, the administration refused to do so after the 2005 hurricanes, arguing that it had given Louisiana enough federal money to cover the local governments' share of the costs. But Louisiana officials said that this money came with significant strings attached and that qualifying for it put a huge regulatory burden on overwhelmed local governments, which have applied for federal assistance for about 20,000 projects so far. States and localities also said they simply did not have the money to put up a 10 percent match. The waiver is not the only help that the newly enacted law affords the gulf region. The measure also includes $1.3 billion for repairs to levees along the Mississippi River around New Orleans, and permits the federal government to forgive repayment of disaster loans made to the communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In addition, it provides for grants for various recovery programs in the region, including one to recruit teachers in Louisiana and another to fight crime by helping New Orleans pay for more police officers and prosecutors."

Now comes a book version for children 11 and up -- or, as the cover puts it, ''Adapted for a New Generation.'' Adapted how? For starters, this book is better organized than the original, with a table of contents, chapter headings and an index -- useful features that the adult edition lacked. It is also about 40 percent shorter. Much of what has disappeared is Gore himself; his autobiographical musings are gone, replaced by a brief introduction. Fair enough: Readers who barely remember the 2000 election will care more about Gore's message than about the personal journey that led him to spread it. What remains is most of the ''good parts'' of the movie: enough geoscience to explain the basics of climate change, and a travelogue of parts of the world where global warming either poses a threat or (Gore suggests) has already taken hold. The beleaguered polar bears are here. So are shrinking glaciers in Switzerland and atop Mount Kilimanjaro, New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and deteriorating coral reefs. The main culprit is carbon dioxide; the solution, a grab bag of technical fixes. ''We have everything we need to begin solving the climate crisis,'' the book concludes hopefully. The science, as far as it goes, is well supported, but some foibles remain from the film. Gore pegs recent hot spells and extreme weather like Hurricane Katrina to global warming a lot more confidently than most climate scientists are ready to do. Many experts suspect that the recent run of hot summers is due to global warming combined with an upward swing in natural temperature fluctuations. A swing back could cool things off for a while, even as overall warming continues. Gore is also mighty optimistic about the ease of reining in humanity's appetite for carbon-spewing combustion. The big question, however, is whether the book's intended audience still needs it. The DVD of the film is required viewing in many schools. Politicians, news editors and curriculum developers are piling onto the green bandwagon. The next generation has plenty of inspiration; what it needs now is nuts-and-bolts information for school reports and debates. Who is doing the science, and where and how? How do researchers analyze satellite data and computer models? What is likely to happen in the near future? This book doesn't tackle those questions, but someone must. Information abounds in Joseph B. Treaster's book ''Hurricane Force,'' but it goes down so smoothly you won't notice. The story starts in the path of Hurricane Katrina, which Treaster covered in August 2005 as a correspondent for The New York Times and witnessed as it struck downtown New Orleans. ''I watched as a dangling traffic light shot across an intersection like a bullet pass, then swung back on its tether,'' he writes. ''Nearby, windows shattered and glass sprayed down on the sidewalk like lethal snow.'' A Florida native and a veteran of a dozen hurricanes, Treaster knows his subject. He explains how hurricanes originate as fragile combinations of swirling, moist air and warm ocean water, how they change character on coming ashore, what makes them so capricious and deadly and, finally, how disaster agencies plan for their arrival. Scientists are the heroes of the early chapters. Meteorologists from the National Weather Service track storms from command posts inside concrete bunkers. Some fly straight into them to drop instrument canisters, crossing into the eye of the hurricane -- ''a place of powerful beauty,'' as one researcher describes it. Later, the spotlight shifts to emergency planners, aid workers and victims. Treaster also tells his exciting ''how I got the story'' story: driving into New Orleans on the eve of the storm's landfall, shadowing the police chief, listening to overwhelmed 911 operators and interviewing residents as the city flooded. The dozens of photographs and some well-chosen maps mesh with the text. There are no how-it-works diagrams, but the writing is so vivid that readers won't miss them. A hurricane is ''a roaring natural turbine'' wrapped around ''a flexing double column of air -- like a rumpled sleeve within a rumpled sleeve.'' Its path over land zigzags ''in a windshield-wiper effect.'' It's no surprise that Treaster's annotated list of references (a welcome extra) includes fiction by Joseph Conrad and Jack London. Readers will finish this book fascinated but probably content to keep their distance. Despite better forecasts and hurricane-proof building techniques, Treaster makes it clear that when a big storm wheels ashore, the best place to be is somewhere else. ''Unless I'm reporting on a storm,'' he concludes, ''you won't find me trying to reason with hurricane season.''

"After touring empty homes that still bear the scars of Hurricane Katrina, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that bureaucratic red tape was ''strangling people'' trying to rebuild here, and proposed steps to speed money to current and former residents of the city. Most of Mrs. Clinton's ideas involved waiving or streamlining federal rules for distributing relief money, chiefly through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that require multistep paperwork, matching dollars or specific purchases. The senator, a New York Democrat seeking her party's presidential nomination in 2008, has also proposed legislation to make FEMA an independent, cabinet-level agency. Some of Mrs. Clinton's ideas, like eliminating a rule that states and cities provide a match to federal emergency dollars, were the sort that community leaders have pushed for some time, and she drew applause from residents who met with her to express frustration about the pace of recovery here. ''I am embarrassed by our failures as a nation; this administration has really let our country down,'' she said. ''Let's cut this red tape. It's strangling people.'' Mrs. Clinton also took a glancing shot at Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, a Republican who she said was not working hard enough with Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, on hurricane issues. ''She has been waging a lonely battle,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''She hasn't had much support from her counterpart; let me just lay it on the table here.'' Calls to Mr. Vitter's offices were not returned last night. At one point, Mrs. Clinton visibly bristled after walking through the home of Gerard Washington, in the Broadmoor district, and hearing him tell of being ripped off by contractors and strung along by government relief programs. Broadmoor is one of the areas that benefited from the fund-raising efforts led by former President Bill Clinton and the first President Bush. ''I'm counting on you as president to come through for us,'' Mr. Washington told Mrs. Clinton outside his half-rehabilitated home. She replied: ''I'll help you as president; count on it. I'm not going to stand for stuff like this. It makes me furious.'' They shook hands, and Mrs. Clinton departed, saying, ''God bless you.'' Mr. Washington was one of several African-American city residents who said they planned to vote for Mrs. Clinton for president. The most common reasons given were her well-publicized support for hurricane recovery efforts, and her political partnership with Mr. Clinton; several voters said they were excited by the idea of his returning to the White House."
"How likely is it that a major hurricane will strike Miami this year? Or Galveston, Tex.? Or the Outer Banks of North Carolina? It's impossible to say with certainty. But weather forecasters are predicting a busy hurricane season between now and the end of November, and are urging coastal residents to be prepared. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of as many as 7 to 10 hurricanes, with three to five with major destructive force -- Category 3 storms (like Katrina) or worse. Atmospheric scientists at Colorado State University have made a similarly worrisome forecast, predicting nine hurricanes, with five ranked, at a minimum, as Category 3 storms with sustained winds of 111 miles per hour or greater. They added that there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the United States this year. While predictions are just that, predictions, historical data can offer perspective. The National Hurricane Center in Miami used such data to calculate ''return periods'' for hurricanes along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts. Forecasters estimated how often, on average, a major hurricane of Category 3 strength or greater would pass within 75 miles of selected coastal communities. The map, below, shows what they found. CHRIS CONWAY The Basics"
"From the vantage point of towns like this, Florida has become the Blue Roof State. Six months after the first of four hurricanes blasted through, thousands of roofs are still in need of repair or replacement, and even the ubiquitous blue tarps protecting them are succumbing to the elements. Some of the roofless have grown restless, scanning repair guides on the Internet for do-it-yourself guidance; others have turned creative. In Pensacola, where Hurricane Ivan hit on Sept. 16, desperate sorts are patching their roofs with used billboard material donated by an advertising company. Robert Switzer, a vice president of the company, Lamar Outdoor Advertising, said the company was offering several thousand billboard ads, made of thick vinyl, to homeowners whose tarps or blue sheeting were deteriorating. ''Imagine a McDonald's sign up on your roof, or Coca-Cola or Budweiser,'' Mr. Switzer said. ''It's something different.'' Florida has about 4,000 licensed roofing contractors, which may be enough in a normal year but not after violent storms sheared shingles, punched holes and sometimes blew off roofs in wide swaths of the state. In Pensacola, Vero Beach and dozens of other towns hit by up to three hurricanes, homeowners who signed contracts with roofers last fall are still waiting for the jobs to begin, partly because of a shortage of shingles and other supplies. ''It's been madhouse,'' said Richard Pepin, president of the Ray Roofing Company in West Palm Beach. His customers are still waiting up to five weeks just for an estimate. ''There's got to be a bigger demand than I've ever seen, and I've been roofing here over 30 years.'' Indian River County, which endured Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in September, issued more than 6,300 re-roofing permits from September through January. Charlotte County, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Charley on Aug. 13, issued 13,958 from August through December, and Orange County, which three hurricanes passed through, gave out 24,135 permits for roof work from mid-August through January. But even with contracts signed and permits pulled, roofers can often do only preliminary repairs because it takes so long for shingles to arrive. Steve Munnell, executive director of the Florida Roofing, Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors Association, said his members were still waiting five or six weeks from the time they ordered shingles to delivery. ''If a customer is not too particular about the color they might be able to get it quicker,'' said Mr. Munnell, whose group represents 575 roofing contractors. ''But we think it'll be at least a year before we see a lot of the tarps go away.'' Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency provided blue plastic sheeting for 143,000 storm-damaged roofs last fall -- in addition to 500,000 smaller tarps that local governments gave out -- the program ended in November and many homeowners have complained that the material is leaking or shredding. Some, like LaDonna Alcott of Pensacola, could not afford new roofs yet even if contractors were available. The shortages of supply and labor have driven up costs and stiffened deposit requirements, several roofers said. ''It's $4,700, so I just have to keep the tarps up to keep any rain off,'' said Ms. Alcott, 75, who said she had no insurance and needed to save money for the roofing job. ''I need to delay this as long as I can, and then maybe it will be a little easier to get a roofer.'' In other Panhandle neighborhoods, the billboard material is making for some curious roofscapes. The leaky roof of Dana Morris, a lawyer from Gulf Breeze, is now shielded by an advertisement for the yellow pages and another for a concert by the rock band Kiss. ''I've never been a real big Kiss fan, but I guess it could be a lot worse,'' said Mr. Morris, 30. ''If it was an ad for erectile dysfunction I would really be up a creek.'' Mr. Morris said contractors in Pensacola could find so many big, lucrative jobs in Hurricane Ivan's aftermath that they had little incentive to bother with smaller ones. ''They've got more work right now than God,'' he said, ''so to try to get one of them to bother with your little house is a trick.'' Stephen Bischoff, president of Vero Beach Roofing, said storm-damaged regions were crawling with contractors from out of state who were not licensed to work in Florida and scammers who took people's money and ran. Gov. Jeb Bush signed an executive order last fall allowing licensed roofers from other states to work here until May as long as they met certain requirements, like paying Florida workers' compensation rates. But Mr. Bischoff and several other roofers said many of the newcomers were not complying. ''People will take a deposit, start the work and then never come back,'' he said. ''We're going to see a lot of roofing here that we'll have to go back and redo, way after all this is done.'' Adding to the problem are well-intentioned homeowners who want their roofs back so badly that they try to make repairs themselves, even if they barely know a hip from a ridge from an eave. ''There have been comments made that anyone can put a roof on,'' Mr. Bischoff said, rolling his eyes, as one of his crews tackled a holey roof in a neighborhood of large houses here. ''You've got to be kidding me.'' William Watson of Orlando took his chances. Over Christmas vacation, he did some research and clambered up to patch his own roof using tar paper, nails, clamps and roofing cement, known to Mr. Watson as ''that black goo stuff.'' Mr. Watson, a business consultant who said his insurance policy would not cover the $1,500 in damage to his roof, said he hoped his amateur repairs would last a few years while he saved for a new one. ''It's not pretty, and I'm sure it wouldn't pass inspection,'' he said, ''but what's the alternative?'' A few miles away, Jewell Johnson was still waiting for a roofer to return her calls, even as her blue tarp shredded and the pieces snowed onto her neighbor's lawn. Since August, she said, she has gone up and down the list of roofers in her phone book, only to be met with busy signals, answering machines or receptionists saying, ''We can't do it.'' The storms loosened the shingles on Ms. Johnson's roof, she said, and the wood underneath is wet. ''Oh, heavens, it's a mess,'' said Ms. Johnson, who is retired. ''I have been calling since last August, and I can't find anyone.'' In Pensacola, some homeowners are receiving aid from religious organizations, which have sent skilled volunteers from around the country to help re-roof and rebuild. ''The Mennonites, the Latter-day Saints, they are our labor force,'' said Dick Appleyard, a trustee of Rebuild Northwest Florida, a private nonprofit group helping repair homes in the Panhandle. ''Some of them will be here two to three years.''"
"It is a safe guess that all of Florida was ready to relegate 2004, with its freakishly active hurricane season, to the history books. But Deltona was especially eager. The town, a sprawling bedroom community between Orlando and Daytona Beach, suffered through three of the state's four hurricanes and still has plenty of blue-tarped roofs and disfigured trees to prove it. A week before the first storm, six teenagers and young adults were bludgeoned to death with baseball bats in a quiet neighborhood here, a crime that was provoked, investigators said, by the disappearance of a video game system. Then, on Dec. 13, a sinkhole began opening along a busy thoroughfare, possibly an aftereffect of the hurricanes and their pounding rain. This sinkhole, a quintessentially Florida phenomenon that is now 225 feet wide and 50 feet deep, brought sightseers, traffic nightmares, more unwanted publicity (''Next up: A plague of locusts, frogs, hail and lice,'' a columnist for The Orlando Sentinel quipped) and new longing for a fresh start. ''It's crazy, the things that have happened here,'' said Larry Amos, walking back to his home after watching crews plug the sinkhole with truckloads of sand -- 1,282 truckloads, to be exact -- on Wednesday. ''The storms, the big murders and now the big sinkhole right in the middle of the road there. It's time for something nice.'' Deltona was meant to be nothing but nice when the Mackle brothers, developers who built an empire designing inexpensive communities for northern transplants throughout Florida, created it in the 1960's. Brochures circulated in Chicago, Cleveland and other chilly cities said Deltona, its name a hybrid of Daytona Beach and DeLand, another nearby city, offered ''everything for zestful living.'' A yellowed newspaper clipping at the Deltona Arts and Historical Center shows throngs of visitors arriving on charter flights from New York and St. Louis for a glimpse of the land they had bought sight unseen. ''Mackle Brothers is bringing the property owners to Deltona to dispel rumors that they're selling swampland in the Central Florida area,'' the caption read. Then, as now, people moved here for the affordable housing (initially as low as $6,960 with $210 down and $43.11 in monthly mortgage payments) and the weather -- generally warm and sunny but, unlike in South Florida, occasionally crisp enough to remind them of the sweetest autumn days back home. Advertisements bragged of Deltona's meandering streets, sandy terrain and many small lakes, but those have proven troublesome as the city's population has grown to more than 80,000. Poor drainage has led to serious flooding, and the city is now building an expensive system for controlling storm water. Traffic bottlenecks have forced several road-widening projects, including on Howland Boulevard, where the sinkhole appeared in the middle of one expansion. Gerald Brinton, the Volusia County engineer, said the sinkhole was probably thousands of years in the making but was precipitated by the hurricanes, which saturated the ground. The gaping hole, which within minutes swallowed trees, chunks of sidewalk, a utility pole and a blinking roadside message board, was probably the largest to appear in Central Florida since 1981. A sinkhole in Winter Park, outside Orlando, consumed a three-bedroom house and five Porsches from a repair shop lot that year and created a 350-foot-wide lake. Because of its geology, Florida gets more sinkholes -- caused by the dissolution of underground limestone by acidic rainwater -- than any other state. The region around Deltona is especially plagued by them, Mr. Brinton said, adding that many of the small lakes visible from the air over Orlando were in fact old sinkholes. But if the Howland Boulevard sinkhole was somewhat predictable for Deltona, the murders in early August were anything but, people here said. The four men charged in the crime broke into a house on Telford Lane late at night and used aluminum bats to kill six people sleeping inside, prosecutors say, because one victim had not returned an Xbox video game system to one of the killers. ''They were just bad eggs, that's all,'' Mr. Amos, 62, who moved to Deltona from New York seven years ago, said of the accused, who have pleaded not guilty to the crime and await trial. Lloyd Marcus, president of the Deltona Arts and Historical Center, took it upon himself to do some public relations for his city in the last days of 2004, writing to a local newspaper about how some residents recorded an album to raise money for a man who had been in a serious accident. ''I can't tell God he's unfair,'' Mr. Marcus said, ''but I do think a lot more positive things are happening here that go unnoticed.'' Mayor John Masiarczyk, who said he was playing hooky on Thursday afternoon to work on his storm-pummeled yard, said 2005 would be a year of rebuilding, replanting and, he hopes, reprieve. ''We could use your kind thoughts,'' he said. Deltona Journal"
"EXTREME WEATHER A Guide & Record Book. By Christopher C. Burt. Cartography by Mark Stroud. Illustrated. 304 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. Paper, $24.95. THE sky is falling, temperatures are more extreme, tornadoes ravage the land, Buffalo is probably buried in snow at this very moment, and it is flooding somewhere in the world. Hailstones the size of pumpkins -- yes, pumpkins -- may be pummeling Bangladesh right now. Your town's temperature may hit a record high today. Or maybe a record low. Or your temperatures may reach a record high and a record low in a single 24-hour period. It happens: not necessarily at the same time all over the world -- that's a disaster movie scenario -- but pretty much every year there is a spate of appallingly anomalous weather somewhere, convincing most of us that the weather is changing, and for the worse. In 2004, Florida was pounded with a record four hurricanes in a single season, a disaster that cost 117 lives and destroyed 25,000 homes. In early January, five days of torrential rains in California triggered mudslides that killed at least 10 people. The same storm brought blizzard conditions to North Dakota, where the wind chill dropped to 50 below. And while it was more a geological event than a climatological one, a magnitude-9 earthquake off the north coast of Sumatra generated a tsunami that has, to date, killed some 150,000 people. Christopher C. Burt, the author of the excellent and addictive ''Extreme Weather: A Guide & Record Book,'' strives to put all this in context. He reminds us that, eons ago, the earth experienced some mind-boggling temperatures: there were glaciers in Wisconsin, and palm trees littered northern Canada. That's climate, of course, not weather. Weather happens in the short term, and we humans haven't been keeping reliable records all that long. ''In the United States,'' Burt writes, ''weather records have been maintained by the official weather services since about 1870. In the 50 preceding years, records were kept intermittently by individuals and by some institutions, including the Smithsonian Institution.'' The figures we have ''represent only a fraction of human experience with weather,'' but may be used as a ''yardstick'' to determine climatic trends. By this yardstick, the weather is not becoming more extreme. Burt, who was born in Manhattan in October 1954, during New York's most severe hurricane on record, was a protégé of the weather historian David M. Ludlum and studied meteorology at the University of Wisconsin. The man is obsessed with violent weather in the pleasantly dotty, accuracy-infatuated manner of someone in the throes of elucidating a lifelong passion. And while extreme weather fascinates him, Burt himself seems to have no desire actually to experience it. He lives in Oakland, described as ''a city of unremitting weather dullness.'' (Earthquakes, apparently, have no dominion over his imagination.) Burt spends but a single page on global warming. ''There is little debate over the fact that over the past 25 years or so global temperatures have risen significantly, and the trend has escalated since 1990.'' Why? Well, he points out that many weather stations have been moved from cities to nearby airports, where acres of asphalt radiate more heat. Some weather stations, previously in the countryside, have been absorbed into urban areas, which are warmer in the winter. Still, deserts are expanding, glaciers are melting, and Burt is obliged to note that ''recent studies'' indicate that an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ''is inextricably associated with global temperature change.'' How hot can it get? The weather station near Furnace Creek, Calif., in Death Valley, located 282 feet below sea level, records an average daily high of 115 degrees and a low of 87 degrees during July, making it the hottest location in North America and ''perhaps the hottest place in the world.'' Oddly, I found myself rooting for Death Valley in the worldwide temperature sweepstakes. The valley hit 134 degrees on July 10, 1913. That's the warmest temperature ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, and is exceeded only by a reading of 136 degrees recorded in Al Aziziyah, Libya, and a ''questionable'' reading of 135 degrees in Algeria. The coldest reading in the United States was 79.8 degrees below zero at Prospect Creek, Alaska, on Jan. 23, 1971. Fort Yukon, Alaska, averaged 48.4 below zero during December 1917, the coldest American month on record. The coldest major city in the lower 48 is Minneapolis-St. Paul, where it hit 41 degrees below zero in January 1889. I am proud to point out that the lowest temperature ever reliably recorded in the lower 48 was in my home state of Montana, where it was 70 below at Rogers Pass on Jan. 20, 1954. I am also perversely proud of the fact that, on Jan. 14-15, 1972, the temperature in Loma, Mont., rose 103 degrees -- from 54 below to 49 above -- the greatest temperature change ever recorded anywhere during a 24-hour period. Burt's book is full of tables listing your state's highs and lows, its precipitation and snowfall records, but ''Extreme Weather'' also provides concise explanations for many of the odd and extreme phenomena he describes. For instance, I suspect many Americans may share my delight in the fact that our nation arguably experiences more severe thunderstorms than anywhere else on earth. Burt explains that this is a result of our unique geography: warm, unstable air from the subtropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold, dry sub-Arctic air sweeping down from the north. Unlike Europe or Asia, America has no mountains running east to west to separate these antagonists. This country is made for lightning storms and torrential rains and heavy floods and hailstorms. In fact, the largest American hailstone ever measured -- a veritable volleyball, seven inches across -- fell in Aurora, Neb., in June 2003. It's disappointing to learn this was not the largest authenticated hailstone in the world. That honor belongs to the Gopalganj district of Bangladesh, where, in 1986, a stone weighed in at 2.25 pounds. ''Its diameter,'' Burt says, ''was not reported, although anecdotal evidence points to stones the size of 'pumpkins.' '' THERE are appendixes at the end of ''Extreme Weather,'' giving city and state snow, precipitation and temperature records. What's remarkable is that almost every place in America seems to hold a record for some bit of exceptional weather. You probably live in, or near, the wettest or the driest place, the windiest or most calm area, the coldest or the hottest place or the one most prone to tornadoes or hurricanes. Something happened where you live: something either fierce or strange or wondrous. For example, a dust storm over Illinois on April 11, 1902, lifted an immense quantity of dirt into the air. Winds pushed this dirt east, where it was sucked into storm clouds, and the next day it rained mud in New York. Burt's book explores killer floods, swirling dust storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, snow and windstorms, as well as ''mud rains'' falling over New York. The weather in some places is extreme in its very lack of extremity. Honolulu is the major American city that exhibits the least extreme absolute range of temperature, which is 43 degrees (52 degrees to 95 degrees). I suspect the locals rarely feel as though the sky were falling. Perhaps there are some who, after spending another predictably perfect day in paradise, occasionally wish that it would. Tim Cahill is the author of nine books, including ''Lost in My Own Backyard: A Walk in Yellowstone National Park.'' He lives near the Yellowstone Plateau, the fourth-coldest region in the United States."
"Who could think of running 26.2 miles at a time like this, when much of what belonged in the air has crashed to the ground? Until Aug. 29, St. Charles Avenue, with its streetcar lines and elegant mansions, provided a lush running path. Even after more than a month of cleanup, the boulevard remains a canvas of Hurricane Katrina scrap art, littered with twisted awnings, tree limbs, the stench of discarded refrigerators, drooping wires and even windblown Mardi Gras beads, broken strands of this city's DNA. Audubon Park is tidier, but there appears to be less shade after Katrina's unartful pruning. City Park is a dead zone of brown, fractured trees. Barbed wire and tree trunks barricade a southern entrance. Tad Gormley Stadium, site of the 1992 Olympic track and field trials, bears a watermark about four feet, the drained and abandoned running track coated with a white film. Along a popular path at the lakefront, broken yachts are stacked like sandbags against a storm that has yet to arrive. Summer heat persisted into autumn, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew discouraged training at the coolest hours. Yet the weather has finally eased, the curfew has been rolled back, the water is drinkable and the runners are returning in small groups, passing each other with small waves of recognition and accomplishment. More than 40 runners from the New Orleans area are still scheduled to participate in the New York City Marathon on Nov. 6. Daniel Zamora evacuated to Jackson, Miss., ahead of Katrina, lost two weeks of training to a sinus infection and bronchitis, and did not have electricity in his Uptown home for a month. But a family friend lent her house so he could train for two weeks on the Mississippi River levee in nearby Destrehan, La. ''The ambience is different,'' said Zamora, 54, who works as a personal assistant and has run 58 marathons. ''The faces are sad. But why not keep running? I want to be positive and strong. I want to keep on going.'' Many have had to go to extravagant lengths to maintain their training. Tim Everard, 51, lost water and power at his home in Lacombe, La., north of Lake Pontchartrain, and spent 20 days in hotels. Since late September, he has been doing what running he can on the helipad and stairs of an oil rig in Angola in West Africa, where he works 28 days on and 28 days off. ''Running is my No. 1 hobby, which allows me to enjoy my No. 2 hobby: drinking beer and eating,'' Everard said in an e-mail message. It is impossible to know how many runners from New Orleans will reach the starting line on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Lives have been blown over like trees, people have scattered, training routines have been interrupted. Twenty-two local runners have officially withdrawn, gaining automatic entry into the 2006 New York City Marathon, but some still on the entry list say they do not intend to compete. Pam Congemi, 36, has run New York three times, but she is an eighth grade teacher, and classes are just resuming at Salem Lutheran School in the suburb of Gretna. With so much time missed, she cannot in good faith leave her students for four or five days to run a marathon. Even so, she judges herself harshly, perhaps too harshly, as a quitter. Somehow, she cannot muster the same defiance after a natural disaster that she felt in New York after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ''I keep beating myself up,'' Congemi said. ''Why don't I feel I can do this? I guess because it's my home this time. After Sept. 11, I felt that strong pull. So many had dropped out. Everyone was afraid. But I ran. This was, 'In your face, bin Laden; you didn't scare me.' Katrina is not quite the same.'' For other runners, the resilience of New Yorkers after Sept. 11 offers hope that New Orleanians may possess the same elasticity after Katrina. Bruce and Geri O'Krepki, both 45, have run marathons in all 50 states. They lost dozens of trees on their property in Hammond, La., north of Lake Pontchartrain. Several pines became unwanted tenants in a guesthouse. The O'Krepkis intend to run New York as an act of renewal. They both grew up in the Lakeview section of New Orleans, and the breach at the 17th Street Canal flooded what used to be Bruce's paper route. ''This trip to New York is like moving on, life keeps going,'' Bruce O'Krepki, a real estate investor, said. ''We're waiting for New Orleans to get off the mat and back on its feet.'' Some on the New York entry list have been caught in brittle indecision. Thomas Barnhorst and his wife, Nicole Gemmell, canceled four days after Katrina struck, then asked to be reinstated. Re-entry was granted, but when reached by phone on Oct. 3, the couple had returned to their home in the French Quarter to discover that it had been looted. ''It's pretty depressing,'' Barnhorst, 35, said. ''Our door was kicked in. I'm not sure what I'm going to do about the marathon. I could do it, but I don't know that I will.'' The couple later withdrew again. Katrina could not have struck at a more disruptive time for marathoners planning a fall race. September is a grueling month for training, with endurance runs building to 20 miles. Darren Whitcomb, an emergency room physician, hung in as long as he could. Finally, the 80-hour weeks at West Jefferson Medical Center in the suburb of Marrero, with rationed food and water, and the five-hour commutes to see his dislodged family in Houston, prohibited any meaningful distance training. ''I just didn't have the energy to do a long run,'' he said. His withdrawal was particularly stinging for another reason. Nov. 6, race day, is his 38th birthday. Whitcomb said he would try to run the Mardi Gras Marathon, still scheduled here for Feb. 5. The sight of a runner in New Orleans can still be jarring to some. In late September, a reporter jogged through the French Quarter and down Elysian Fields Avenue near dusk, only to be stopped by a truck driver who asked, ''You O.K.?'' He apparently feared the jogger was running from something instead of simply running. And perhaps it is best not to dwell on whether running shorts and a T-shirt provide reckless protection in these enter-at-your-own risk days in New Orleans, where cleanup crews are wearing masks, gloves and long sleeves. At the request of an emergency medical worker who saw her running amid the debris on the Jefferson Parish side of the 17th Street Canal, Leigh Ayn Drye of Metairie was inoculated against tetanus and hepatitis. She sometimes feels more like a hurdler than a runner, leaping glass and nails and other flotsam, but she persists in her running and plans to go to New York. ''Some people eat or drink,'' said Drye, 35, who said she ran the Boston Marathon, finish to start and start to finish, in 8 hours 20 minutes last April. ''I run.'' In Katrina's wake, running has provided comfort, camaraderie, a sense of routine, a way to assess a city's damage and spirit for renewal. Patrick Melancon, 39, a New Orleans architect, teetered on withdrawing from New York, but indolence and despair added 5 or 10 pounds to his lean frame, so he began training again and intends to run the marathon. ''I didn't know where my friends were, I didn't know the status of my projects, and the city I love was obliterated,'' Melancon said. ''Any one of those would have been a jolt, but together they put you in a web of depression you can't get out of. With these extreme highs and lows, running keeps you centered, although centered is a relative term.'' Andrew Lilly, 29, a law clerk and organizer of the Catch 22 Track Club, withdrew from New York. He had lost his peak fitness and worried that he would be far from his personal best of 2:41. It also seemed audacious to run through neighborhoods while people were returning to find their homes destroyed. But he reconsidered, and decided to run as a sign that ''New Orleans is still here.'' Lilly petitioned the New York Road Runners, which operates the race, and was granted entry with about 10 running partners. They include Daniel Simpson, 29, a certified public accountant from Arabi in neighboring St. Bernard Parish, where floods destroyed his home and the homes of his sister, his parents and his grandparents. As he and his wife evacuated to Atlanta, then Houston, Simpson said, running has allowed him temporary release each day from his displacement and given him patience for a long-term recovery. ''After finishing my first marathon, I know I have the endurance to do anything,'' said Simpson, who has run 12. ''Surviving a hurricane, and getting your life back together, doesn't happen overnight. It's a long haul. You have to persevere, keep moving, the same as in running. Eventually you get through it. If I wasn't a runner, maybe I wouldn't have the same outlook.'' Fifty-five miles southwest of New Orleans, in Houma, La., Brenda Means has maintained her training even though Katrina damaged her patio and a fence, and Hurricane Rita warped her wood floors. New York will be her first marathon, and though a lack of electricity replaced her careful carbo-loading with a temporary diet of chips and dip, running has provided constancy and solitude. This was particularly urgent when her home was filled on some days with 17 or 18 displaced relatives. ''It has kept my sanity,'' said Means, 40, who manages an orthodontia practice. ''It gives you something to do besides looking at the boarded-up windows and warped floors.'' In New York, she plans to wear a shirt with a special message. She has an idea: Running to the Big Apple from Katrina. MARATHON"
"The Red Cross's failure to provide an accurate tally of the hurricane evacuees living in hotels, thus grossly overstating the cost to the government, could further undercut its efforts to reassure the public that it has adequate systems to account for the $1.2 billion it has collected for the relief effort. Even before the housing mistake, the organization was struggling to overcome complaints from hurricane victims and its own volunteers working in the Gulf Coast area that it had been slow to respond, bureaucratic and disorganized. State regulators and the group's former president have also criticized the organization as lacking transparency and accountability. Red Cross officials ''said two or three days ago that they are going to have to redouble their efforts to make their $2 billion target for fund-raising, and this kind of news certainly isn't going to help them with that,'' said Paul C. Light, a professor at the Robert Wagner School of Public Service at New York University. The Wagner School does surveys of public confidence in charities, and 43 percent of those who responded in July said they had a great deal of confidence in the Red Cross, while only 6 percent said they had no confidence in it. In another survey of about 1,000 people completed on Sunday, 38 percent reported a great deal of confidence in the charity, while 10 percent reported none. Professor Light said that the shift was statistically significant and that confidence in charities over all had remained the same. The scale of the relief effort for Hurricane Katrina has dwarfed the organization's previous missions. Among the complaints is that debit cards it distributed were faulty. Long lines formed at its disaster assistance centers, and people reported waiting hours to get through on its toll-free telephone lines. Local officials said it seemed unable to track its own operations. Vernon Jones, chief executive of DeKalb County, Ga., which became a temporary home for some of the displaced, said the charity needed more automated systems. ''It's a matter of using technology to automate their processes,'' Mr. Jones said, ''which would help cut down on fraud and improve their ability to know what they're doing.'' Red Cross officials said no amount of technology would have helped avoid the problems. The hotel mistake was a flaw, they said, in a new reporting process required by the government that had to be carried out quickly. ''We ended up miscalculating this one figure,'' said Armond T. Mascelli, vice president for response operations, ''but people across the country still ended up having housing and our other services.'' Mr. Mascelli said the Red Cross was installing computer and telecommunications systems that would link all its chapters and allow it to adjust depending on the demands of a disaster. It also uses satellites to broadcast data when telephone and cellular lines are down. ''A lot of difficulty we're now finding in disasters is that when you lose infrastructure, you don't have a lot of things we take for granted in our daily life, like computers,'' he said. The disclosure that the Red Cross had overstated the number of people living in hotels came as no surprise to some who have monitored the organization. ''The experience of the New York attorney general's charity bureau with the Red Cross post-9/11 led me to conclude that the organization has serious accountability problems,'' said William Josephson, a lawyer who led the bureau during that time. Mr. Josephson faulted the organization's 50-member board. ''The nearly 900 chapters, with 30 seats on the board, effectively control it, a classic example of the tail wagging the dog,'' Mr. Josephson said. ''The president of the United States appoints 12 members, 7 of whom are cabinet secretaries, but how much time can they devote?'' By law, the Red Cross files its financial statements with the Department of Defense, which told the New York state attorney general's office that it audits KPMG, the organization's auditor, but not the charity itself. Lt. Col. Rose-Ann L. Lynch, a spokeswoman for the department, said she could not say how extensive its audit was. Dr. Bernadine Healy, who resigned as president of the Red Cross following the Sept. 11 attacks over policy differences with the board that included her efforts to improve accountability at the chapters, has said that financial mismanagement at the chapters led her to mistrust the organization's internal and external auditors. ''Their approach to disasters has not significantly changed, and they are not prepared for disasters of today and tomorrow,'' she said. ''It's all about cots and food.'' In a brief telephone interview last month, Tim Holmes, the Red Cross's internal auditor, said he had quit to settle a family estate and had no plans to return to the organization. STORM AND CRISIS: THE CHARITY"
"Budget cuts have cost the Army Corps of Engineers crucial scientific expertise that might have helped it to prevent levee failures in New Orleans and to do a better job restoring the city's battered flood protection system, members of a panel of prominent outside experts said. ''The corps is, right now, stretched very thin,'' said Raymond Seed, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and a lead investigator on a team exploring the levee failures. ''They are really struggling.'' Members of the team said the corps's problems were so pronounced that its earliest efforts to patch five levee breaches were inadequate and had to be redone after an urgent appeal by outside engineers. Two teams of outside investigators have been looking into the failures of the levees: one from the American Society of Civil Engineers and a second made up of experts from Berkeley and other institutions. The second group is financed by the National Science Foundation. The investigators have traveled to New Orleans to examine the levees directly, working with the corps and engineers from Louisiana State University. The National Science Foundation group expects to produce a preliminary report next month. Dr. Seed and colleagues said the corps might not have recognized longstanding soil problems beneath the levees at two New Orleans canals that left the floodwalls vulnerable to forces of wind and water from Hurricane Katrina. Levee failures at those canals flooded much of the city. ''They still have good people -- what they have is less of them,'' Dr. Seed said. ''It strikes me as potentially dangerous over the long term.'' The reasons for the decline, he said, include budget cuts for the corps and a shift away from the enormous construction projects of the past toward more environmental restoration. The broad government push to privatize functions of government has also contributed to the problem, Dr. Seed said, noting that some functions once handled by the corps, like soil boring and testing, are now conducted by contractors. He compared the corps to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was criticized as losing expertise because of budget tightening after it was shifted into the Department of Homeland Security. Dave Mraz, program manager for Bay-Delta Levees at the California Department of Water Resources and a civil engineer not associated with the investigative panel, agreed that the corps had lost some of the competence that made it possible to spot problems in the complex and murky world of soil analysis. ''Now they let out the job and the contractor supervises, and they supervise the supervision,'' Mr. Mraz said. ''It doesn't give you the same feeling for being out there on the ground and addressing the problems in real time, and it doesn't give you the expertise you need when you're getting yourself into trouble.'' Donald L. Basham, chief of engineering and construction for the corps, acknowledged that it had gradually given up its own drilling rigs and crews for soil boring, but he said that ''we have still kept the expertise in house'' to control the quality of those operations. ''We have not completely contracted out the technical expertise,'' he said, adding that the corps still had the ''boots on the ground, dirt under the fingernails'' exposure to issues. The levees of New Orleans suffered more than a dozen breaches because of the hurricane, and most involved water coursing over the tops of levees and floodwalls and scouring away the supporting earth on the other side, leading to collapse. In general, the corps maintains that the flood protection system of New Orleans was simply overpowered by a storm that exceeded the forces it was designed to withstand. Questions of levee construction are most pointed in the failures at the 17th Street and London Avenue Canals, which showed no sign of being overtopped. In an Oct. 11 letter to corps officials, Dr. Seed wrote that the failures at those levees were clearly the result of unstable soil. That contention is supported by documents that emerged from a legal dispute in the 1990's over work by a local contractor, Pittman Construction. In the lawsuit, the company alleged that the corps had not provided it with enough information about problems with the soil along the 17th Street Canal. Efforts to build concrete caps and segments of floodwall along the canal were complicated by shifting soil, the company said. The Oct. 11 letter from Dr. Seed also described post-hurricane problems with the levee patches made by the corps, which were riddled with sinkholes. He described them in an interview as ''melting in place.'' The corps has reworked the patches, and Dr. Seed said he was satisfied with the repairs. But he said the initial work had troubled him. ''It's pretty spooky stuff,'' he said. Robert Bea, a Berkeley colleague of Dr. Seed, said the goal in raising an alarm about problems within the corps was to seek the best protection for New Orleans in the future. ''Our motive behind this is not blame and shame,'' Mr. Bea said, ''but to find out why these things happened so when we do go forward we won't make the same mistakes.'' The most important goal will be to ensure that the corps has enough financing to do the job well, said Mike Parker, a former assistant secretary of the Army. Mr. Parker left office in 2002 after he testified that the administration's financing request for corps projects was too low. Little has changed since then, said Mr. Parker, a former congressman. He estimated that full financing for the current corps should be $6.5 billion a year, about $2 billion more than the amount spent. ''We know what needs to be done,'' Mr. Parker said, ''and then we turn around and don't fund it.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE LEVEES"
"President Alfredo Palacio's attempt to convene a 100-member constituent assembly to write a new constitution was blocked by his political opponents, further weakening his shaky hold on power. Electoral authorities rejected his request, and opposition lawmakers then called for his resignation, saying he had overstepped his powers because only Congress has the power to change the Constitution. Mr. Palacio, who has no power base in Congress, took office in May, when protests forced out President Lucio Gutiérrez. Juan Forero (NYT)"
"Christopher N. Smith was caught by surprise when Hurricane Charley crashed ashore here last year, buckling and tearing at his nearly 100-year-old cypress and pine house and destroying much of this little Gulf Coast town. ''In my opinion,'' Mr. Smith said Thursday afternoon, ''it was too late to evacuate. We figured it was best to stay here.'' After the first of half a dozen windows blew in, though, the Smiths realized they might die in the storm. Yet with forecasters saying that Hurricane Wilma was bearing down on Punta Gorda and the rest of the western coast of Florida, the Smiths, along with their 5-year-old daughter, Isabella, were staying put, at least for the moment. Across southern Florida, tens of thousands of people, from Key West and up the coast as far as Sarasota, had already begun evacuating. Seven hurricanes have hammered Florida in the last 14 months, and residents know what the storms can do. Still, for others, the warnings about Hurricane Wilma have been too broad and fluctuating. Many residents cannot decide what to do. ''We're keeping an eye on it,'' Mr. Smith said. ''If it really looks like it's coming in here, we could leave on a moment's notice.'' On a picture-perfect day, with a bright sun, clear blue skies and a mild, cooling breeze, it was easy to understand the hesitation. Less than an hour away, couples were strolling past sea gulls on snowy white sand on Siesta Key, a small island on the gulf in Sarasota County. Molly Johnson was jogging behind a stroller, her daughter Ruby aboard. ''Right now, it's so iffy,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''I'm just living life like normal.'' Forecasts first called for the storm to hit Florida's west coast on Saturday, but it is now expected on Sunday. Thousands of tourists were evacuated Thursday from Cancun and Cozumel, which is expected to take a direct hit from the storm on Friday. Tom and Jen Hayes flew in to Sarasota on Thursday morning from Asheville, N.C., for a Saturday wedding on the beach at Siesta Key. ''We called our friend,'' Mrs. Hayes said of the bride-to-be, ''and basically she didn't give us an option.'' They had planned to take a taxicab to their hotel, but changed their minds. ''We got a rental car, and we'll try to outrun it if we need to,'' Mr. Hayes said. In Tallahassee, Gov. Jeb Bush warned that Hurricane Wilma was ''a dangerous storm'' and urged Floridians to prepare. ''Many, I am sure,'' the governor said, ''will compare this storm to Hurricane Charley and think, 'Well perhaps it may not be as strong a storm as Hurricane Charley, so therefore we don't have to worry about it as much.''' But, Mr. Bush said, ''You do.'' Hurricane Wilma reached wind speeds of 175 miles an hour on Wednesday, and forecasters described it as the fiercest storm they had ever seen. The winds dropped to 145 m.p.h. on Thursday, but forecasters said they expected the storm to strengthen as it moved into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, then possibly diminish somewhat before striking Florida. Ben Nelson, the state meteorologist, said the hurricane could create storm surges up to 15 feet high that could devastate stretches of the coast, where thousands of houses and condominiums line the beaches. By Thursday afternoon, Hurricane Wilma was about 400 miles from Key West. Tourists were ordered out of Key West on Wednesday, and Mayor Morgan McPherson said he planned to make evacuation mandatory for everyone on Friday. ''The sentiment among the forecasters is that this hurricane is so erratic that it appears to have a mind of its own,'' Mr. McPherson said. ''They are not exactly sure where it is going. ''It is imperative,'' he said, ''that people heed the warning and evacuate. With the size and magnitude of this storm, if you wait until it is on top of us, it will be too late.'' On Wednesday night in Key West, some went to the St. Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Church to pray and light votive candles. The saint ''has always protected us,'' said Christina Todd, who has lived in the Keys more than 10 years. ''She will make sure we are safe.'' Up the coast, by midday, a solid line of cars was creeping north along Interstate 75 as thousands of residents headed out of harm's way. ''Why wait?'' asked William Davidson, a retired firefighter, as traffic stalled south of Sarasota. Mr. Davidson was at the wheel of a pickup truck, towing a 16-foot fishing boat, followed by his wife, Darlene, in their Chevrolet. They live in Port Charlotte, which was heavily damaged last year by Hurricane Charley. ''After Hurricane Charley,'' Mr. Davidson said, ''this is freaky.'' On Fitzhugh Avenue here in Punta Gorda, Jim Reily was plastering the interior walls of a little two-room house and said he expected to be working there through Saturday. ''It's one thing to be prepared,'' Mr. Reily said. ''But it's another thing to be so frightened that you're not going to do anything else. If it gets close, I'm out of here.''"
"South Florida was a coast-to-coast mess on Tuesday as millions of people remained without power, huge lines formed for basic supplies and drivers wove through packed, debris-strewn streets with no traffic signals. Despite Gov. Jeb Bush's assurances that recovery from Hurricane Wilma would proceed smoothly after lessons learned from seven previous storms, the government response looked frayed. In Broward and Miami-Dade Counties, people lined up for ice and water only to learn that government deliveries of both were late. Many busy intersections had no police officers to guide impatient drivers. Schools and most businesses remained closed as dazed multitudes wandered in search of food, gasoline and cellphone reception. The one bit of luck was blissfully cool air, brought in by the storm, that made the lack of air-conditioning endurable. A day after Hurricane Wilma struck, leaving at least six dead, power had been restored to several hundred thousand households and businesses by Tuesday evening. But 3.1 million still had no electricity, including about 93 percent of customers in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties. Eleven other counties also reported power failures, many of them widespread. Officials at Florida Power and Light said some customers might have to wait four weeks. More than half of the shelters that opened for the storm had already closed on Tuesday, but about 50 still held more than 7,000 evacuees, state officials said. There were scattered reports of looting, and dawn-to-dusk curfews remained in place throughout the region. Water pressure was low in many places, and residents were advised to boil what came out of their faucets, a hopeless proposition for the legions whose stoves and microwaves were dead. President Bush, criticized for a slow response to Hurricane Katrina, planned to come to Florida on Thursday to inspect hurricane damage, the White House announced. Especially frustrating for many people were the waits for ice and water at distribution points that opened hours later than promised, if at all. Mike DeLorenzo, chief of Florida's Emergency Response Team, said that traffic and debris prevented trucks from arriving on time. At the Orange Bowl in downtown Miami, cars wrapped around the stadium and families waited hours to get their share. ''My mom is at home, she's bedridden and she needs her fluids,'' said Milagros Arocena, whose car barely advanced during the hour she had waited. ''This line is incredible, but I don't know where else to go.'' Deena Reppen, a spokeswoman for Governor Bush, said long lines and supply shortages were to be expected in the first 24 hours after a hurricane. ''The state is working around the clock with local and federal partners to push more food, water and ice into the area,'' she said. In Miami-Dade County, where only 6 of 11 ice and water stations opened around the promised time of 2 p.m., Mayor Carlos Alvarez promised that the rest would open by day's end and said that all things considered, the delay was not bad. ''Let me just say that it's been a logistical challenge,'' he said. ''We are trying to make good on a very bad situation. Can we improve? Obviously.'' Mr. Alvarez said that only 10 percent of the county's 2,600 traffic lights were working and that about 40 accidents, including 12 that were serious, had occurred as a result. He said that the county courts would be closed for the rest of the week but that the port would reopen to cruise ships and trucks on Wednesday. Miami International Airport reopened for limited flights on Tuesday afternoon despite extensive damage to terminal roofs and jet bridges. Fort Lauderdale International Airport remained closed except to private aircraft. Across the state in Naples, just north of where the hurricane made landfall early Monday, ice and water distribution appeared to be going more smoothly. At one station, members of several National Guard units were operating with assembly line precision. By 9 a.m., hundreds of cars, from Mercedes Benzes to jalopies, had lined up on a road leading into the parking lot of Barron Collier High School. A National Guardsman in camouflage fatigues waved cars forward, and as each rolled up to a squad of soldiers, one sang out, ''Pop the trunk.'' Other soldiers stepped forward with cartons of bottled water and plastic bags of ice, putting them in the car, tapping the trunk shut and motioning the driver on. Each delivery was over in seconds. ''We've done this so much over the last two or three years that we're getting pretty good at it,'' said Sgt. First Class Tim Harper of the 265th Air Defense Artillery of Sarasota. The storm clogged the streets of Naples, one of the wealthiest cities in the country, with fallen shrubs and trees. But even as the wind was dying down Monday afternoon, yellow frontloaders were pushing and shoving and lifting away debris, and by Tuesday afternoon the main streets and most residential byways were clear. Floodwater that had risen knee-high in some parts of Naples also was all but gone by Tuesday afternoon, as it was in Miami's downtown banking district. But the sleek high-rise buildings that line Miami's Brickell Avenue, home to some of Florida's largest banks, law firms and expensive hotels, looked shabby with many windows blown out, the glass shattered in the street below. ''It looks worse than it is,'' said Cesar Alvarez, chief executive and president of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which lost windows in about a third of its lawyers' offices. Schools throughout South Florida will stay closed for the rest of the week, officials said, and the Broward County Courthouse, a high-rise building that lost dozens of plate-glass windows in the storm, will not reopen for at least two weeks. Ceilings collapsed in judges' chambers, and the jury room, state attorney's office and public defender's office were also damaged, said Chief Judge Dale Ross. One of the state's biggest businesses is growing ornamental plants and flowers and trees, but dozens of nurseries in the southwest Florida were battered by the storm. At the H.M. Buckley & Sons wholesale nursery in Naples, about half of the 40 workers turned up Tuesday to find the plastic and mesh covering ripped off many greenhouses. A few had been knocked down, and some sheds had been reduced to heaps of shredded lumber. Tom Buckley, the general manager of the nursery and the fifth generation of his family in the business, said it could cost several hundred thousand dollars to restore things. Most of the property, he said, is so fragile it cannot be insured. The strain showed in his face. ''I knew what I was going to find when I checked this out on Monday,'' Mr. Buckley said. ''I didn't necessarily expect the demolition of some of the houses. But five minutes later it was time to pick up the pieces and move forward. You just do what you've got to do.'' Though police spokesmen warned of steep fines and multiple points on driver licenses for anyone who cruised through intersections, courtesy often failed in a region where drivers are less than civil even on normal days. Things were slightly more orderly at the few grocery stores that opened, where people wheeled carts through darkened aisles. At a gas station in Plantation, near Fort Lauderdale, a dozen police officers kept order among hundreds of people carrying gas cans and a milelong line of vehicles. Dimitrios Halivel, the station's owner, who was limiting every customer to $20 worth of gas, said he was regretting his decision to open. ''There's too much pressure,'' Mr. Halivel said. In the Florida Keys, many longtime residents who defied evacuation orders called Hurricane Wilma the most fearsome storm in memory. Areas normally high and dry during storms were under nearly four feet of water. The currents pushed saltwater through some of Key West's oldest and most expensive residential neighborhoods, and during high tide 70 percent of the island was underwater. Many homes in the Lower Keys appeared uninhabitable, and thousands of vehicles were either destroyed or had their electrical systems crippled. Yet power was restored on Tuesday to the old historic district and other parts of Key West and the Lower Keys, with an estimated 9,000 homes back on line by evening. Governor Bush visited Key West and went to the high school, a Red Cross staging area and shelter for those who lost their homes. He tried to appease fears that tourists would stay away from Florida because of the sizable damage. ''People are going to remember their memories here and want to come back,'' Mr. Bush said. STORM AND CRISIS: FLORIDA Correction: October 28, 2005, Friday An article on Wednesday about the scarcity of supplies in South Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Wilma misstated the surname of a service station owner who was limiting every customer to $20 worth of gas. He is Dimitrios Halivelakis, not Halivel."
"At lunchtime, the music is loud and lively at the Five O'Clock Grille on Bourbon Street. Waiters polish tables. Bartenders pour drinks from rows of gleaming bottles. And the restaurant's doors are thrown open, as if to make it easier for a passer-by to become a patron. But behind the welcoming facade, the restaurant is grappling with a staffing crisis, not unlike the city's as a whole. Only about 20 of the 108 employees who worked for the owners before Hurricane Katrina are back on the job. Among the waiters are five single men just arrived from Kentucky and living in trailers. There is a ''help wanted'' sign in the windows, and one longtime employee is hundreds of miles away, waiting for unemployment benefits. The hours are shorter, and the menu is limited. ''The majority are not coming back,'' the general manager, Irvin Dussom, said shortly before making a phone call to try to find a local apartment for a former worker. ''They are having trouble finding housing here, or they are satisfied with the housing where they are.'' Large numbers of workers who lived in New Orleans are now scattered throughout Louisiana or neighboring states, unable to return to flood-damaged houses and leaving hundreds of businesses unable to reopen or operating below capacity. Many are out of contact, or have settled elsewhere to enroll their children in schools. Some positions are being filled by people from other states looking for new job opportunities in construction or, as in the case of the Five O'Clock Grille, service jobs. Even as many jobs go begging, unemployment has spiked, driven not only by the dislocation of workers but also by the shuttering of flood-devastated businesses in no condition to reopen. Since the hurricane, the Louisiana Labor Department has received 296,000 unemployment insurance claims. In all of 2004, there were a bit more than 193,000. There are also longer-term implications. With jobs lost, shuffled and solicited, the work-force crisis is changing the very demography of New Orleans. With schools still closed, for example, families have migrated to other states to look for work and stability. Many of the newer workers here are younger and single, able to double up in apartments. Better-off and more mobile workers, some commuting from nearby areas, have begun to replace workers who could not afford cars. One of the new waiters at the Five O' Clock Grille is Shelby Molohon, 21, who drove 15 hours from Kentucky to repair roofs. When that job fell through, he drifted into the French Quarter. ''I like the area,'' he said. ''I want to stay.'' Some families have become single-parent households, with a mother or father absent out of necessity. ''A lot of people are doing what I am doing: they are commuting, and their family is staying somewhere else,'' said JoAnn Madison, a 40-year old waitress who reclaimed her job at the Sheraton here, where she lives in a hotel room while her husband, who is not working, and son live in Baton Rouge. The French Quarter emerged relatively unscathed from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the flooding they brought. But beyond its balconies and courtyards, swaths of residential areas are still without housing, electricity, schools, water, gas and public transportation. Without housing for workers, many businesses cannot open. And without services from businesses and government, many workers will not return. ''You've got this real chicken-and-egg problem,'' said Peter Ricchiuti, an assistant dean at Tulane University's business school. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said at a recent news conference that restoring the hospitality sector, a cornerstone of the New Orleans economy, was a high priority for the state. Mayor C. Ray Nagin said the city was trying to get trailers or other temporary housing for workers, possibly tent cities. The Louisiana Labor Department's plans include job fairs, transportation services and Internet résumé-matching. But it is not clear how long it will take to repair the symbiosis between housing and jobs. ''On a long-term basis, we have got to make sure to rebuild and repopulate these cities with the folks who lived there before,'' said Andrew Kopplin, the governor's chief of staff. ''It is a mismatch of where jobs are available and where workers are.'' Mr. Kopplin added that in some cases, oil platform workers and pipe fitters had found that they could earn more money driving debris trucks for the cleanup, making it harder for businesses to restart. In New Orleans alone, 81,000 businesses were disrupted in some way by the hurricanes, Mr. Kopplin said. Hotels have tried to adapt by cleaning rooms less often, restaurants by limiting hours and offering smaller menus. At the landmark Napoleon House restaurant in the French Quarter, the owner's son, Nicholas Impastato, 35, pitches in to cook the lunch fare of jambalaya, gumbo and red beans and rice. ''Two of the guys who worked here for years and years, they are set for a year in Ohio,'' Mr. Impastato said, pausing in the restaurant's courtyard, where ceiling fans rotated lazily overhead. ''They have no home to come back to.'' Some who might like to return are still stuck in nearby cities working at jobs beneath their qualifications just to make ends meet. Robert Myer, an owner of Express Personnel Services in Baton Rouge, said he had placed teachers in administrative jobs and athletic coaches as assistants with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''There are people who are changing fields completely,'' Mr. Myer said. ''They say, 'I just have to work,' and don't know if their companies are going back. Then there are people who say they want to go back but they have to educate their kids. Or they can't let their kids live in a house where there is mold growing.'' Debra Young, a 52-year old teacher from New Orleans, went to a job fair in Baton Rouge and picked up an application for a rental car company, but for days could not bring herself to fill it out. ''It is not easy to find a job here,'' Ms. Young said. ''They want some of us to go to Burger King, but that's not why I went to school. I am trying to find something close to what I studied.'' Karin Peri-Ramos, a 39-year-old divorced mother of three, earned about $33,000 a year as floor manager of the Five O'Clock Grille before leaving her flooded house in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans. She settled into a borrowed house in Marietta, Ga., enrolled her children in school and is living on $4,300 from FEMA as she waits for unemployment benefits. For now she is trying to keep her foot in the door at the restaurant, driving seven to eight hours each way every other weekend to work, hoping the management will stick with her. ''I want to go back home,'' she said. ''But not now. I don't have a school for my children and don't have electricity. The gas is off.'' Ms. Peri-Ramos says she worked through the aftermath of previous hurricanes, but like thousands of other people is now unable to return to her damaged house. Instead of a salary, she is counting on a new currency: loyalty from the Five O'Clock Grille. ''They could hire someone to take my place,'' she said, ''but I never left them before.'' STORM AND CRISIS: EMPLOYMENT"
"USED-CAR buyers found bargains galore this summer as trade-ins from record new-car sales flooded the market. But losses from back-to-back hurricanes are expected to start driving prices back up later this year. ''Not only has the supply side lost some vehicles, but demand will be up as well because so many cars have been destroyed by these storms,'' said Paul C. Taylor, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade organization in McLean, Va. What remains to be seen is how many cars will actually be replaced. An estimated 475,000 cars were lost to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Mr. Taylor said. But of that number he predicted only about 300,000 to 400,000 would be replaced. Factors like lack of insurance, underinsurance and loans that were higher than the value of the car will make it difficult for some owners to replace their vehicles. Many owners will also not get around to replacing lost cars until they have taken care of more immediate issues like housing. Clouding the picture further are higher gas prices, which are thought to be slowing the sale of both new and used cars. ''Everything seems to be going sideways,'' said Marvin Suskin, a partner at Scarsdale Ford in Westchester County and former chairman of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. ''People are sitting back waiting to see what's going to happen. What kind of deals are there going to be on new cars? What's going to happen with gas prices?'' Employee pricing incentives offered by General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler on new cars resulted in record sales of 1.8 million new cars, light trucks and vans in July alone. That led to a jump in the number of used cars for sale, because nearly 60 percent of the new-car purchases involved a trade-in. ''We put about 150,000 more cars into the marketplace in July than would be typical,'' Mr. Taylor said. As a result, used-car prices plummeted and, for now, remain down. ''We took in a lot of trades and now we're selling those at very good prices,'' Mr. Suskin said, adding that inventory of new cars was low. ''We're continuing to do that because we don't think we're going to get a good fill of '06's for another month or so.'' Steven Kuhlman, a Sacramento--area real estate broker, said that earlier this year he shopped around for a new van, but found new-car inventories low. In June, he shifted his game plan and bought a used fully loaded, low-mileage 2003 Chrysler Town and Country van at CarMax for nearly half the price of a new van. ''There were just a ton of cars out there,'' Mr. Kuhlman said. In September, used-car prices were down 4.2 percent compared with the year before, according to Edmunds.com, the auto information Web site. But a close look at the figures reveals sharper declines in some segments than others, particularly large pickups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans. The price of used compact cars and compact pickups was actually up, 1.5 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, a company in Bandon, Ore., that tracks automobile sales, predicts there will be a record number of used cars sold this year and, he said, despite higher gas prices there will still be a market for large S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks at drastically reduced prices. ''There's a lot of pent-up demand from those people who previously hadn't been able to afford to buy those,'' he said. ''Clearly one of the issues is, how low do you move the prices to move the product?'' CONSUMER"
"In the hotel and restaurant business, it's the location. Everyone knows that. But a little ingenuity also helps, and Philip J. McCabe has buckets of it. A day after Hurricane Wilma ripped through Naples, one of the wealthiest towns in the nation -- with so many millionaires, only the billionaires get much attention -- Mr. McCabe's eponymous pub was overflowing with customers in an area mostly without power or open restaurants. Like magic, the lights in McCabe's Irish Pub & Grill twinkled on at 2 a.m. Tuesday, less than 12 hours after the winds from Hurricane Wilma trailed off. Mr. McCabe celebrated by offering free bagels and coffee for breakfast. By noon he was doing a brisk lunch business, with baskets of fish and chips flying out of the kitchen. ''We're packed,'' said Mr. McCabe, a former analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. He helped spy on the Russian space program during the cold war but decided he could make big money as an entrepreneur. He understood location. And location was especially important to Florida Power & Light, one of the state's biggest utility companies. Nearly a week ago, company executives jumped on initial forecasts that Hurricane Wilma was heading for Naples and booked 65 rooms at Mr. McCabe's Inn on Fifth, a vaguely Mediterranean-looking place next to his pub. Both sit on Fifth Avenue, the quaint main boulevard with antique-looking street lights and patches of pink paving stones, not far from the emergency management offices for Collier County. Mr. McCabe welcomed the business, but he wanted something in addition to the slightly discounted $190-a-night room rate. ''As we were signing the contract with them, we said, 'Look, we want power,''' Mr. McCabe said. ''They wouldn't put it into the contract, but they verbally agreed to prioritize us. They said they needed power for their people staying here anyway.'' It helped that Naples Community Hospital, an automatic priority for the power company, was just three blocks away. In Miami, Michael Villafana, a spokesman for Florida Power, said that the utility did not favor commercial customers, but that Mr. McCabe's good fortune probably reflected his proximity to the hospital. He ''just got lucky,'' Mr. Villafana said. By noon Tuesday most of the fallen trees and shrubs on Fifth Avenue had been swept into neat piles. But most of the high-end fashion shops, jewelry stores and brokerages were still shuttered. So were all the other restaurants and bars. ''I have an island of electricity here,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''There are 28 restaurants on Fifth Avenue, and I'm the only one open.'' Some of Mr. McCabe's employees were repairing their homes, so others did double-duty. Cathy Christopher, marketing director for the inn, was seating guests and busing tables at the pub. Some women ordered a glass of white wine with lunch, she said, but the Guinness on draft was really flowing. ''It's a beer day,'' Ms. Christopher said. At one of the faux-marble tables on the pub's terrace, Pat Shapiro, a graphics designer, and her husband, Dick, a real estate agent, ordered turkey club sandwiches. She got a glass of wine. He was drinking club soda. It was bright and sunny with a crisp, cool edge to the air. The Shapiros said the hurricane tore down the screen cage around their swimming pool and ripped off some roof tiles. ''But my airplane,'' a single-engine Beechcraft Sundowner, ''is still here,'' Ms. Shapiro said. ''The airport is really damaged.'' The Shapiros are regulars at the pub. ''This is where we always come,'' said Ms. Shapiro, originally from Elizabeth, N.J. ''The place is always open, no matter what happens.'' STORM AND CRISIS: UTILITIES"
"Hurricane Katrina made it politically necessary for Republican Congressional leaders to tone down their effort to kill off federal programs for affordable housing. But it has not stopped them from dragging their feet on an important bill to create a valuable housing fund by tapping into a small portion of the after-tax profits of the federally backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The fund would initially be aimed at the hurricane-ravaged gulf states, but would eventually help to house poor, elderly and disabled people nationally. Not satisfied with just delaying the bill, House ideologues are advocating an outrageous and potentially unconstitutional provision that would bar the nonprofit groups that build most affordable housing from participating in the fund if they also participate in even nonpartisan voter registration. This would force such nonprofits to choose between their historically important roles: promoting civic engagement and providing housing and other services for low-income people. The provision would conflict with state laws that require housing grant recipients to do things like register voters and would put the federal government in the unacceptable position of actively discouraging political participation. The long-overdue housing fund contains numerous safeguards that would prevent grant recipients from using federal dollars for advocacy. A measure that would bar them from nonpartisan activities has absolutely no place in a democracy. Editorial"
"In the annals of modern travel, few horror stories can compete with those being told by American tourists who thronged the airport here on Tuesday, trying to find a way home after surviving Hurricane Wilma. Many had spent up to five days in squalid public shelters in Cancún during the hurricane and after it and then endured a 12-hour ride through flooded highways to get to this city, 200 miles to the west, only to find that they could not get a flight out. ''I am about to lose it,'' said Lakeyda Timmons, a manager for a Wal-Mart store in Kingston, N.Y., summing up the mood in the terminal. Ms. Timmons was in a 150-foot-long line to buy a ticket to anywhere in the States. ''We've been lied to and lied to and lied to,'' she said. Ms. Timmons and hundreds of other Americans arrived here on Monday night on 18 buses that the American Embassy and the Mexican government had chartered to take them from shelters in Cancún, where the airport was closed. When they arrived, they found the airport gates closed and spent the night sleeping on the floor of a high school gymnasium. The small airport was jammed with exhausted people sitting on suitcases and plastic chairs, collapsed on the lawn outside, frantically calling travel agents on their cellphones and generally losing their tempers. Several said they were disappointed that the American government had not done more to evacuate them from Cancún, where there was no running water or electricity three days after the hurricane. A spokeswoman for the embassy in Mexico City, Judith Bryant, said an additional eight busloads of tired tourists had left Cancún for Mérida along with dozens of buses provided by private tour companies whose guests had weathered the storm. Ms. Bryant estimated that 6,000 American tourists remained in temporary shelters or small hotels in the city. The Cancún airport continued to lack a control tower, electricity and radar. Three emergency flights from Mexicana airlines along with a couple of charter planes were allowed to land on Tuesday, but it was unclear when the field could handle heavy traffic, Ms. Bryant said. Bus after bus disgorged tourists here, where the lines and confusion grew. ''We were led to believe, at least I was, that there was a plane that was going to be able to take us,'' said Greg Cunningham of Sterling, Va., who arrived on a bus with his wife, Lea. ''When we arrived here, they don't know anything about it.'' Among the most unhappy travelers were a group of Americans who were evacuated last Thursday to a cultural center in Cancún. That night, the roof blew off the shelter, and they crossed the street to a school in high winds, holding a rope. The Mexican authorities kept them from leaving the shelter until Monday, they said. There was no running water. The toilets overflowed with sewage. Food ran short, and they survived on tuna fish, crackers and some water delivered by the Mexican Marines. On Sunday, looters tried to break in to the shelter. Soldiers drove them off by firing into the air. ''There were rats and cockroaches,'' Jacinda Corning of Kenai, Alaska, said. ''We lived on bread and water. The Mexican government wouldn't let us do anything.'' Mexican officials told the group that they could not retrieve their luggage from their hotel, which was on the barrier island. Some ignored the order and did it anyway. ''We were told for three days the hotel zone was flooded out, that there were crocodiles out there,'' Don Forbush of Ohio said. ''Then four of us went out there in a taxi and just walked right in.'' The group at the school was one of the first to accept the consulate's offer of a bus to Mérida. Members arrived after the airport had closed, and in the morning, they learned that there were no seats available on any flights. Only Continental Airlines and the three main Mexican airlines have landing rights here, although the government has told American diplomats that it will allow other airlines to land here in the emergency. Frontier Airlines does not normally fly here, but sought permission to do so to transport Americans home. USA 3000 sent 12 168-passenger Airbus A320's on Monday to Cancún to pick up 2,162 passengers, the airline's chief operating officer of the airline, Angus Kinnear, said. Many Americans paid more than $1,000 to fly to Dallas on Mexicana or Aeroméxico, in the hopes of finding flights home. STORM AND CRISIS: MEXICO"
"The remnants of Hurricane Wilma combined with a northeaster yesterday to drop nearly two inches of rain on the region and rake the New Jersey coast with high winds and a pounding surf that eroded beaches and undermined boardwalks. Minor flooding was reported in Bay Head, Manasquan and Washington Township in Burlington County. Some areas of Cape May County around North Wildwood lost electricity on Monday night and yesterday morning. About 5,000 customers were affected. Areas of New York City, Westchester and Long Island also lost power, phone or cable service through the day. But by the early afternoon, as rainfall turned to intermittent drizzle and winds died down from gusts of 30 to 40 miles an hour, the National Weather Service lifted its flood warnings and wind advisories. The agency issued the warnings late Monday when it feared that the combination of the two weather systems might create more serious problems. New England, however, was hit harder, as the storm drew strength from a fleeing Wilma, resulting in high waves, wind gusts of up to 60 miles an hour and coastal flooding. Fishing fleets remained in port. The wind brought tree limbs down and in some cases, with the ground already saturated from previous rain, toppled entire trees, knocking out power to more than 70,000 homes and businesses across Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, said he was thankful that Wilma and other hurricanes had largely bypassed the state. But he said the recent rains had done enough damage to raise concerns about beach erosion this winter. ''Our basic view is that we got a double whammy in the succession of storms that have not allowed time for the beaches to recover,'' he said. ''The severity of the impact will depend on what we see for the rest of the season.'' Manasquan lost about four feet of beach to erosion, said Capt. Elliot A. Correia of the town's Police Department. But he said residents counted themselves lucky in light of forecasts. ''We definitely escaped here,'' he said, noting that the town did have some minor tidal flooding along Brielle Road near the Manasquan Inlet. ''We're lucky that the wind died down.'' The blustery, rainy day ended up treating shore gazers in New Jersey and New York to views of a crashing surf, with whitecaps atop murky 15- to 20-foot waves. And conditions were right for boogie boarders by midafternoon after the rain let up. ''It's too good an opportunity to pass up,'' said Ryan Laudisi, 21, who had come to the beach in Bay Head from Point Pleasant with his friend Jason Bitzer, 24. In Seagate, on the western tip of Coney Island, Russell Yusupov, 45, stood on his deck overlooking Lower New York Bay and Gravesend Bay watching what he called a ''dramatic'' tableau. ''The water is higher than normal,'' he said. ''But it's not a big deal. It just looks dramatic with the clouds and the waves crashing into the bulkhead.''"
"Persistent downpours and whipping winds hit the New York region for a seventh day on Thursday, flooding people out of their homes in at least four New Jersey towns, pushing sewage up through toilets in Jersey City, downing power lines and leading many to wonder when the deluge would end. In the areas hardest hit -- along the Passaic, Ramapo and Pompton Rivers, which snake through North Jersey -- roughly five inches of rain had fallen over the last 48 hours. Two more inches are forecast by early Saturday, when many rivers are expected to crest and overflow. ''This is a midlevel system that is moving very, very, very slowly,'' said Mark DeLisi, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, N.J. ''It's taking a lot of time to move out, and we just keep getting more and more rain.'' Even if the skies clear, low-lying areas could still end up under water because runoff from New York flows into New Jersey rivers, said Dennis McNerney, the Bergen County executive. ''The water is eventually going to come down to us,'' he said. ''That's the concern.'' For most of Thursday, assessments of damage ran hand-in-hand with preparations for even more flooding. In Essex and Passaic Counties, at the request of local officials, the National Guard was busy distributing more than 1,000 sandbags for protection against swollen rivers. Acting Governor Richard J. Codey said he put 30 guardsmen on alert in case the flooding worsened. Several towns, including Wayne, Lodi, and Oakland, had issued flood warnings by evening, advising all riverside residents to evacuate. Rising waters in Lincoln Park also forced residents to flee. In the section of Oakland along the Ramapo River, where soupy brown water had risen halfway up front doors, police officers were going house to house to ask the last few stragglers to leave, including a handful who were out and about in canoes. On Fayette Avenue in Wayne beside the Pompton River, a tributary of the Passaic, many homes seemed empty by early afternoon. The river was using a boat ramp as its own on-ramp to the street just behind the New Jersey Transit station, and the water was flowing past flooded houses faster than rush-hour traffic. A few hundred yards across the Pompton on Riveredge Road in Lincoln Park, residents darted in and out of homes that were only a few feet from the rising brown flow. Doug Mackey, 63, said he was checking to make sure his sump pump worked and collecting jewelry in case his small one-story home was overrun. ''You never know how high it's going to come,'' he said, noting that the river had already risen by seven or eight feet in a week. ''There's not much you can do to fight Mother Nature.'' Commuters throughout the region faced troubles of their own. Though trains generally ran on time, according to transportation officials, midday delays at Newark and La Guardia Airports lasted as long as two hours. New Jersey Transit's bus garage in Oradell nearly flooded early Thursday morning, forcing its drivers to start and end their routes at a nearby parking lot, a detour that caused delays of about 15 minutes on many bus routes in Bergen County, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for the agency. The rain also flooded part of the Garden State Parkway in Irvington and the Routes 1 and 9 approach to the Holland Tunnel, and it closed roads in Hillsborough, Rahway, Livingston, Lincoln Park and Ocean City, among other places. In Hudson County municipalities like Hoboken, Bayonne and Jersey City, the heavy rainfall caused sewer systems to overflow, forcing water up through toilets and bathtubs and causing sewers to back up onto residential streets and major roadways. ''The water has no place to go,'' said Joseph Beckmyer, chief engineer for the Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority. As a result, Mr. Beckmyer said, untreated water was being dumped into the Hudson River, as permitted by the state's environmental regulations. Several large blockages of storm drains were probably contributing to the flooding, he said. Work crews were trying to unclog the smaller drains, but engineers will have to wait for the water to subside before clearing the larger ones, he said. Some New Jerseyans seemed especially eager for an end to the water. Edith Seltenheim, 83, a riverside resident of Oakland since 1955, said she was frustrated by the tease of intermittent drizzle and then downpour. ''It gets your hopes up, then dashes them,'' she said from her perch on the second floor of her two-story home on Lakeview Terrace. ''Will you tell God to please make it stop?'' Business owners in Lodi, where North Main Street was inundated overnight, could not wait for a reprieve. Jay Patel, 41, the owner of a Dunkin' Donuts just off Route 46, said more than a foot of water poured into his restaurant on Wednesday night. By Thursday morning, mud covered the floor and it was unclear when it would once again be time to make the doughnuts. ''All the furniture and electric is shot,'' he said. ''We don't know when we're going to reopen.'' A few feet away at the Santangelo Funeral Home, Matt DiChiara said he and his uncle, who owns the business, had to move about a dozen caskets to the second floor on Wednesday night when the water rose to their garage. Luckily, in contrast to what occurred during Hurricane Floyd in 1999, he said, all the caskets were empty. Beaches were also affected. Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said coastal areas of Long Beach Island, including Harvey Cedars, Long Beach Township and Beach Haven, lost much of the sand and vegetation that builds up in the summer, ''leaving some areas vulnerable to storm surge and direct wave attack.'' She said that in Beach Haven, municipal officials were using bulldozers Thursday to push sand farther up the beach. Only minor to moderate damage was reported for the rest of the New Jersey Shore. Elsewhere in the New York region, the storm's effect was less severe. Some smaller streets were closed on Long Island, in Westchester County and in Connecticut, but major highways generally stayed open. Connecticut Light and Power reported that more than 900 people in Greenwich were without power as of 3 p.m. Thursday, and at least 100 more throughout the state also lost power. There were scattered power failures on Long Island, affecting about 1,200 customers. In New Jersey, nearly 100 PSE&G customers were without power by early evening. Some people in the hardest-hit sections seemed able to take their problems in stride. Lisa Berrian, 34, a waitress and mother of five, refused to leave her home in Oakland, even though it is beside the Ramapo River. After 12 years and several floods, including one in April that brought water up over her waist, she said, ''It's just something you get used to.'' More bothersome, she added, is the week of water, the relentless precipitation, with more on the way. ''It's a continuous rain,'' she said. ''It's very aggravating.'' Correction: October 20, 2005, Thursday A picture caption on Friday about flooding in Oakland, N.J., misidentified the location where two friends went for a canoe ride. It was on a street there, not the Ramapo River."
"Edna Briant, 87, marveled that the bus was so big and luxurious and that there was so much to see along the way. ''As tired as I was, I wanted to stay awake,'' Miss Briant said, ''because it was like going on a tour passing all those Wal-Marts and McDonald's.'' She was seated in the second row, next to her sister, Claire, 84, both evacuating this Houston suburb as Hurricane Rita approached, just two weeks after they fled New Orleans and the rising waters of Hurricane Katrina. In the row behind them was Harry Reynolds, 68, an amputee, who used a vacant seat to elevate what was left of his right leg. A few rows back sat 68-year-old Natalie Lenzner, who had terminal brain cancer, settling in for what would prove to be a 15-hour ride to Dallas. The Briant sisters and Mr. Reynolds would survive a deadly explosion, ignited by oxygen canisters, that left the bus a charred husk and became a defining image of Hurricane Rita. Mrs. Lenzner would perish, one of 23 frail residents of a home for the aged who died escaping a hurricane that, as fate would have it, killed nobody in the Houston area except those running from its predicted fury. Who lives and who dies in a disaster is often a matter of happenstance, and so it was for the people on this bus, all residents of Brighton Gardens, owned by Sunrise Senior Living, a company based in Virginia. But here, the destiny of these passengers, so dependent on others, was determined by many people who planned for them. Local emergency officials urged the nursing home to evacuate. The governor of Texas waived normal regulations to put more buses on the road. Family members either followed the advice of Brighton Gardens' administrator to take their loved ones home or they made other plans, perhaps because their own houses were in the path of the storm. Sixty-one residents removed by their families did just fine, and 16 others were safely evacuated to Arlington, Tex. But 37 with special medical needs -- the Briant sisters, Mr. Reynolds and Mrs. Lenzner among them -- were put on a bus at 3 p.m. on Sept. 22, bound for another Sunrise center in Dallas. Many needed wheelchairs, oxygen or dialysis, and some were lost in the fog of Alzheimer's disease. Had their trip been uneventful, as it was until 6 a.m. that Friday, just 22 miles shy of their destination, there would be no second-guessing, no what-ifs, no probing the practices of a tiny bus company. Those concerns have consumed many people: Caretakers who agonize that they did not do enough. Lawyers seeking recompense or retribution. Family members who envisioned gentle departures for their relatives. But in the aftermath of tragedy, peace may come easier for the very old. The 14 who survived, when 23 of their companions perished, are taking small pleasure in their remaining days rather than revisiting the moment with grief counselors. A Sense of Adventure Edna Briant's task on the bus trip was to look after her sister, Claire, who was oblivious to most of what was going on because of her advanced dementia. ''She didn't understand about fire or putting on her shoes, or whether to leave her purse behind,'' Miss Briant said. The sisters were evacuating for the second time in two weeks, sent to Brighton Gardens from their shared New Orleans apartment at a Sunrise center that was swamped once by Hurricane Katrina, again by levee breaches during Hurricane Rita, and is now in ruins. Virtually everything the two women owned was lost in the storms. Now the rest is gone, including Miss Briant's last $75, her Medicaid card, her checkbook and the key to a safety deposit box in New Orleans, all incinerated on the bus. Mr. Reynolds, a barrel-chested man, was charmed, he said, by ''them little bitty girls'' who passed an apple back and forth during the bus ride, alternating bites. He was already lying on the roadside when Edna was carried off the bus, flung over a rescuer's shoulder, and placed beside him. ''Prop her up on my good leg,'' Mr. Reynolds requested. That way Edna could see her if her sister was all right. Miss Briant did not ask about the others on the bus, not at the scene or later, after the group was flown from Dallas back to Houston on a flight reserved for the survivors and a dozen babies who had been evacuated from a foster care center. Rather, she regaled nurses and a reporter who visited her room with an animated account of her great airplane adventure. Going through airport security, patted down and wanded, was a new experience. An 11-day-old foster child was ''cute as can be,'' and Claire got to hold the baby. The flight attendants passed out goody bags with balloons shaped like airplanes and gave the old people pilots' wings, just as they do for children. Back home at Brighton Gardens on Thursday, Miss Briant was looking forward to her exercise classes, and to gardening, especially watering the Christmas cactus. But that activity was canceled, much to Miss Briant's disappointment, because of a session with a grief counselor. ''A man came to talk to us, but nobody understood him,'' she said. A History With Hurricanes London England, 86, a pioneer of early radio and television in Texas had been at Brighton Gardens for only three weeks, recovering from a broken hip when he was carried onto the bus. He was not fortunate enough to be carried off. The man with the unforgettable name had spent his lifetime telling and retelling an unforgettable story about hurricanes: his wife's grandfather had died while riding out ''the big one'' that wiped out Galveston in 1900. It was family lore, and he told it whenever he had a chance -- how his grandfather-in-law was found dead in his house by his son. How everyone else had gotten out, but he had refused to leave. So when Hurricane Rita approached Houston, Judy White, Mr. England's daughter, was not taking any chances. She made sure her father had what she thought was a safe exit in place, and then she and her family fled. ''There was no question that we'd all evacuate,'' said Ms. White, 56, who was staying at her father's house because her own home in New Orleans had just been destroyed by Katrina. ''We have a long history with hurricanes.'' She and her husband, their daughter and dog ''sat in traffic for 14 hours and never left the city limits,'' she said. Sweltering in 100 degree heat, starting to run out of gas, and thus reluctant to use the air conditioning, she turned around and went back to her father's home. She recalls feeling confident in her decision, thinking how much better her father would be on the cool, comfortable bus. It took days to confirm Mr. England was dead and begin planning his military funeral. ''We knew who got on the bus and who didn't get off the bus,'' Ms. White said. ''I'm just hoping he was asleep.'' Harry Wilson, 78, had never planned to sit in the front of the bus. He had wanted to be near his best friend, Natalie Lenzner, who had shared with him the indignities of age and illness. Both quietly knew she was most likely making her final journey. Mrs. Lenzner was already situated several rows back, and getting Mr. Wilson on board would be difficult since he was 6 feet tall and 189 pounds, and paralyzed on the left side from a stroke. So his daughter, Eileen Kisluk, a lawyer in Houston, suggested that firefighters carry him on last. Neither Ms. Kisluk nor her mother, Bernice Wilson, thought they could take care of Mr. Wilson in a Category 5 hurricane, which Rita was predicted to be. They needed to prepare their own homes for the storm and asked Jeffrey, Mr. Wilson's oldest child and an architect in Tampa, to fly to Dallas to meet his father with ''a friendly face'' when he got off the bus. Mrs. Lenzner's husband, Richard, 71, was also afraid to bring his wife home, knowing the power might go off and she would suffer needlessly, said the Lenzners' daughter, Michelle Tell. So Mrs. Lenzner went on the bus and her husband followed behind in his car, with Mr. Wilson's wheelchair in the trunk. The evacuation gave Mr. Wilson his first chance to travel since his stroke, and Mrs. Lenzner was looking forward to seeing her daughter and possibly being in Dallas for the birth of her second grandchild, two weeks away. Because he was in the front row, Mr. Wilson was the first person carried to safety. He lay on the side of the road, stung by fire ants, and watched helplessly, shouting warnings to rescuers that oxygen tanks were on board. In what seemed like 30 seconds, he said, the bus exploded. As Mr. Wilson was taken away in an ambulance, he worried about Mrs. Lenzner, whom he had not seen. Richard Lenzner had followed the Brighton Gardens' group for six hours, sharing the driving with his son, but pulled off the road to stretch his legs and walk his dog, Ms. Tell said. When he got back on Interstate 45, he figured the bus was way ahead of him. When he arrived at the Sunrise center in Dallas at 3 a.m., Mr. Lenzner was surprised the evacuees were not already there. Jeffrey Wilson arrived at the Dallas hospital shortly after the bus passengers, alerted that his father was there. He already knew Mrs. Lenzner had not made it. But he did not tell his father, waiting until his sister, Ms. Kisluk, arrived. She was the one accustomed to being in charge, he said, since his parents had moved from New York City to Houston to be near her. ''She's protective of him,'' Jeffrey Wilson said. ''She had wanted my mom to ride with him, but my mom saw no value in that. And thank God she wasn't on that bus, too.'' The Lenzners, for their part, had been prepared for Mrs. Lenzner's death. She had transferred to hospice care a week before the explosion. But Ms. Tell believed her mother would live long enough to see her new granddaughter. ''She wanted so badly to have a chance to hold the baby,'' Ms. Tell said. ''And I just really feel we were robbed of that.'' Help Moving Forward Unlike the elderly survivors, who are by their own accounts settling in without distress, the six staff members who had volunteered to ride the bus with the residents cannot speak of what happened without weeping. Ayu Tayework, a registered nurse, keeps asking herself: ''What if I did this? What if I did that?'' Bonnie Estes, an administrator, finds consolation only in the hope that this ''makes us stronger and softer.'' Dr. Joseph Morgan, whose mother, Alta, a resident, is three weeks shy of her 100th birthday, has no doubt that staff members did all they could. Their attentiveness began even before the buses pulled away, when the head nurse at Brighton Gardens gave him her cellphone number so he could track the progress of the evacuation. ''As a physician and as a son, I can tell you that moving them inland was wise,'' he said. Dr. Morgan, an oral surgeon, woke early on Friday, Sept. 23, to brew a pot of coffee and track the storm on television. He had not been among the city's 2.5 million evacuees because doctors were asked to remain behind. First up on CNN were reports that a bus carrying elderly people had exploded. The next report said it was en route to Dallas from a nursing home in Bellaire. ''That's when it got to be kind of personal,'' Dr. Morgan said. He immediately called the nurse's cellphone. ''Indeed, it was our bus,'' she told him. Then he waited. An hour and a half later, Dr. Morgan got a call from the emergency room at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. His mother's hair had been singed, and she had inhaled some smoke, but otherwise she was fine. As Dr. Morgan spoke, his mother, now back in Bellaire, was at her regular seat at dinner, enjoying the entree, chicken cacciatore, that two others in the dining room were complaining about. The resumption of talk about food was a signal that life was returning to normal. A few residents were busy with a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle. Some snored on the sofa. Everyone seemed delighted to see Mimi and Zoe, the dog and cat that live at Brighton Gardens, and to hear the twitter of birds in cages in every corner of the room. STORM AND CRISIS: THE EVACUATION Correction: October 8, 2005, Saturday Articles on Monday and on Sept. 25 included an erroneous account from Texas officials about the legal status of an unregistered bus that exploded and killed 23 passengers being evacuated from the path of Hurricane Rita. The state now says the bus was not covered by a waiver signed by Gov. Rick Perry to let unregistered commercial vehicles take part in the evacuation. A corrective report appears today in the National Briefing column, on Page A16."
"Friday was the third day of the search, and still there was no sign of little Ana Castro Guzmán. Her family's adobe house, built on the side of a mountain, had been consumed by a mudslide, one of dozens following Hurricane Stan this week that left at least 508 people dead and 337 missing across Guatemala. While estimates vary, as many as 105 more have been reported killed in Mexico and other parts of Central America. Ana, 4, was swallowed with the house, along with her grandparents, her mother and four other children, ages 14, 11, 7 and 1. Two neighbors who tried to come to their rescue died when a second mudslide hit. All the victims have been recovered and given proper burials -- except Ana. Dozens of friends and neighbors came with sticks and machetes to help her surviving relatives find her. ''This has caused us great pain,'' said Ramón Noj, one of Ana's uncles. ''We feel sad because it is not only us, it is almost all our community that has been affected.'' The rain that wreaked havoc from southern Mexico to El Salvador this week continued falling in Guatemala's highlands on Saturday. Still, the government had begun to bulldoze its way through mud-covered highways to reach stranded communities to deliver food, water and medicine; to rescue survivors from dozens of villages that had disappeared beneath the mud; and then to begin the dreadful search for the dead. The nation's 24-hour news radio station reported searches all over the mountains, from Guatemala City to the border with Mexico. A house in the province of San Marcos had collapsed with nine people inside, six of them children. And then there was word that a shelter not far away had slid down a mountain, killing an estimated 50 people. So far, however, the largest number of victims, about 117 of them, have come from this breathtaking area, inhabited mostly by peasant Mayan farmers, around Lake Atitlán. Carlos Fernández, an agronomist at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, said part of the reason the mountains had melted into mud was the generations of deforestation. Others suggested that poverty played a role, and that poor farmers had settled in areas long at risk for such disasters. But there was no place else for them to go. Now the people here have joined with rescue teams to claw away at the mud, to retrieve lost loved ones. Some people realized the magnitude of the task and wondered aloud whether it was time to give up. Others said they were determined not to let nature have the final say over the dead. ''If what people tell us is true,'' said Benedicto Girón of Guatemala's civil defense agency, ''there could be another 300 to 400 people dead there,'' around the lake. That is indeed what the people here say. A 63-year-old elementary school custodian named Rafael Estrada hobbled, cold, hungry and traumatized, into a shelter here late Friday night from the village of Panabáj, which sits at the bottom of a volcano. The village had had about 260 houses, he said, but it does not exist anymore. ''It's a floor of dirt,'' he said. ''It's a desert.'' He described roaring rivers of mud rushing down the mountain, burying the village in what seemed -- as his life flashed before him -- like an instant. Mr. Estrada, wrinkled and toothless, his loafers caked with mud, said he had been saved because he had rushed to the second floor of the school. Most of his family, except his sister and her three children, survived, too. Everything and everyone else that mattered to him was gone. ''There's no reason to go back there,'' he said. Mario Sicajao, a reporter for a Christian radio station here, said the authorities had begun to acknowledge quietly that there was so much mud, believed to be dozens of feet deep in places, they might not be able to recover all the bodies in Panabáj. ''There is talk that if they can't get all the people who are buried there,'' he said, ''then they are going to leave them there and declare it a national cemetery.'' That is not what people here have in mind for Ana. By the end of the third day of their search, there was still no sign of her, but Mr. Noj, her uncle, said they would be back digging on Saturday, and Sunday, and for as long as it would take to find her. ''It is our tradition,'' he said, his bloodshot eyes peering from beneath a straw hat, ''not to leave anyone behind.''"
"Word spread fast after the evacuees arrived. Everyone wanted to see one up close. Soon, the gravel driveways wending through the grounds of the old church mission were backed up with trucks and minivans filled with locals bearing bottled water or leftover clothes or just wanting to talk to the Louisiana people, tell them how sorry they were for what had happened to them. The Methodists brought cribs. A dentist sent a box of toothbrushes. A Presbyterian was recruiting for the choir. Members of the Sequoyah Memorial Hospital Auxiliary showed up to take the evacuees shopping at Wal-Mart. A beautician wanted to do their hair. And someone donated a box of formal wear that, the volunteer sorters noted, the evacuees were not likely to need anytime soon. In the beginning, it seemed that wherever the Louisianans went, people stopped them on the street, figuring that because they were black, they must be from the hurricane. A man went up to one of them, Gerald Cooper, a former merchant mariner, and said, ''Here, put this in your pocket,'' as he stuffed a $20 bill into Mr. Cooper's hand. ''It was like we were a fad,'' Mr. Cooper said. In the chaotic first weeks after Hurricane Katrina, several vanloads of Louisiana exiles, including Mr. Cooper, arrived disheveled and sleep-deprived at the old mission grounds here, miles from the edge of nowhere in the middle of eastern Oklahoma. They were among the tens of thousands of people forced out of the Gulf Coast and into unaccustomed holding places where no one knew quite what to make of them. They had suddenly become nomads in their own country -- pitied, gawked at and shuffled from place to place, stuck in the middle of a long journey that would take them through several states merely to get to this way station from which to plot the rest of their lives. In time, they found themselves caught in a web of red tape and cultural miscues, clashing with locals over the tiniest of things, like how to cook grits or season meat, or over the life-and-death question of why they did not get out of harm's way in time. Tensions rose, and by the end of the month, the Louisianans, grateful though they were, could not wait to get out. And the local people, well-meaning and overwhelmed, were just as relieved to see them go. An Odyssey Begins Their time at the mission would become both an object lesson in the psychic strains of disaster recovery and a laboratory for the challenges of sheltering victims so different from their caregivers. This particular colony of exiles, thrown together at random, was first delivered by bus and military cargo plane to Fort Chaffee, an old Army base in westernmost Arkansas, which became a kind of Ellis Island, some 9,000 evacuees passing through its gates the first week after Hurricane Katrina. There, Red Cross workers assigned them to vans that would spirit them even farther away. It was as if they had been hurled into another galaxy, a stubbled land of raccoon woods and Andy Griffith towns, Indian smoke shops and creased-faced cowboys in pickup trucks. As they passed from Arkansas into Oklahoma, the evacuees made little comment to their cheerful Presbyterian drivers, too exhausted to register an opinion. The convoy exited the highway at the billboard that said ''Jesus'' in big cursive letters. It passed Hog Creek and the tractor supply shop and rumbled along unmarked roads. The land was becoming sparser and drier. They had passed the last traffic light miles ago. There were no other cars on the road and no more stop signs or signs of life other than cows resting under the locust trees. They had seen no other black people since leaving Arkansas. Now they saw no people at all. Some of the evacuees began to grow fearful. ''Where is they taking us?'' Nitayu Johnson, a hotel maid with a young daughter, remembered thinking. ''They trying to slave us. They going to make us pick cotton. We gon' die.'' In fact, they were bound for Dwight Mission, an old church outpost whose log cabins and stone dormitories were used as a boarding school for Indian children decades ago, and which now serves mainly as a campsite for local church groups. There were 19 people in the first wave of arrivals, dominated by a blustery clan whose patriarch, Louis Green, a widower, was once a pool shark who had made a living breaking players with more money than sense in the pool halls of Louisiana. Mr. Green, 65, arrived with 5 of his 19 children, 5 of his 29 grandchildren and four smaller households who had banded together with his family for protection in a fetid school gymnasium outside New Orleans in the darkest days during and after the storm. Soon afterward, Eugene and Helen Johnson arrived, a retired couple, unrelated to Nitayu Johnson, who had lost each other at the Superdome when Mrs. Johnson, in the early stages of dementia, never made it back from a trip to the restroom. For four days Mr. Johnson searched for her in vain. In the chaos of the evacuation, she was airlifted to Arkansas, and he to San Antonio. They were reunited at the mission in Oklahoma after the Red Cross, along with their grandson Charles, located Mrs. Johnson in Arkansas. ''Money couldn't buy that when I seen her,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''After all what we went through, I said, 'Bring me to a dry place.''' Among the other arrivals were the wife of Mr. Cooper, Antionette McNeely, a frail diabetic who was hospitalized upon landing in Arkansas; Dejawhn Riggs, a college student in wire-rimmed glasses and a polo shirt, who had attached himself to the Green family but stayed to himself and rarely looked up from his single hot rod magazine; Mr. Green's father-in-law, Richard Harris, a gaunt, mysterious figure who preferred to sit in a metal folding chair with a cigarette rather than speak of whatever he had seen at the Convention Center in New Orleans; Corille Johnson, Nitayu Johnson's pigtailed, 10-year-old daughter, who talked about rapes and dead bodies over Jell-O at dinner; and Charles Johnson, the elder Johnsons' 20-year-old grandson, who was counting the minutes until he could get out. The first night, people either slept better than they had in days (the elder Mr. Johnson said anything was better than sitting upright at the Superdome) or could not sleep at all. Bats circled the night sky beating their wings, coyotes howled in the woods by the creek, turkey vultures and chicken hawks cawed in the distance, and inside the dormitory, coughs and footfalls echoed down the bare wood corridors. Charles Johnson, who had been a hotel clerk on Bourbon Street, could not rest knowing that the dormitory's front doors were not locked. The doors to the rooms were not locked either; they did not even have doorknobs. Mr. Riggs, the reclusive college student, locked his door with a spoon. ''We out here in the woods,'' the younger Mr. Johnson said, ''and anybody could get in.'' The staff assured their guests that they were perfectly safe. ''We are providing a sanctuary for God's people,'' Haan Phelps, the director of the mission, said. ''You don't hear sirens and police cars going up and down around here.'' Settling Into a Routine Because of the complexity of the lives that had to be sorted out, what was supposed to be a three- to five-day stay turned into weeks. Everyone settled into a routine that no one seemed especially happy with but was the best anyone could do under the circumstances. It made for testiness on all sides. The three mission staff members -- trained not as the social workers, job counselors or triage nurses the catastrophe called upon them to be but rather as camp directors --treated the visitors as they would summer campers. They set out a schedule of breakfast at 8:00, lunch at noon and so on, allowing about half an hour per meal. But many of the evacuees chafed under the rules. They were exhausted, some were sick, and they wanted to sleep late and move about in their own time. They were working people -- hotel maids, maintenance men, cashiers and nursing assistants -- who were used to cooking for themselves on their own schedule and did not like being told what to do and when to do it. But if they failed to make it to a meal in time, there was nowhere else to go. In the initial euphoria, there were grilled steaks and potatoes, pancakes at breakfast, hot meals three times a day. But the staff, stretched thin, could not keep it up and never expected it would have to. Breakfast became cold cereal, packets of instant oatmeal that nobody seemed to open, see-through coffee and the occasional bowl of grits. Lunch was cold cuts on white bread. And dinner, the only hot meal, might be sausages and rice or canned spaghetti. If the evacuees had come from any other city in the country, it might not have mattered so much. But food became the topic of every day's conversation and the cause of many rolled eyes. The blander the food got, the fewer people showed up and the less they ate, and the more disillusioned the staff got. ''I don't like to throw food away,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''It's frustrating when somebody takes three biscuits and only eats two.'' He took to going table to table, chiding the children to eat all their food, which only irritated the parents and made them less likely to come and eat. ''This is not a restaurant,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''They can't come in here and order New Orleans shrimp, because I don't know I'm going to get reimbursed for it.'' Homesick, Mr. Green's daughter Serrita picked at her cornflakes, while her 2-year-old son, Terrell, splashed milk out of his Cheerios. Charles Johnson stabbed at his dry sausage and rice over dinner. They were missing sweet cornbread, stuffed bell peppers, gumbo, pickled pigs' lips. It was all some of them could do to sit on the other side of the kitchen and watch what was coming out without getting an apron and a skillet themselves. Someone found them hot sauce, and nearly a month into their stay, the cook finally got the hang of the red pepper requirements and made some faux jambalaya with a gallon of hot sauce that nobody but a Louisianan could eat. But few were around to try it because they had already given up. Mr. Johnson told his wife not to meddle. ''That's they kitchen,'' he said. ''What they doing is all right.'' For her part, the cook, Maxine Moore, was doing the best she could. She could work only part time and only on certain days. She was a single mother raising three disabled children, holding down another full-time job and driving 300 miles round trip to get there from her hometown, Possum Holler. Oklahomans just eat differently from Louisianans, Ms. Moore said: ''Rednecks and cowboys are meat and potatoes people.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Riggs, the college student, was missing not just the food. ''I hate not being able to get me a shot every now and then,'' he said. Somehow, the visitors had to find a way to coexist until they could figure out where to go next. The quieter people sequestered themselves on the more secluded second floor. They took rooms at opposite ends from one another for privacy's sake. They did not all get along and did not pretend to. The upstairs people had little patience for the spirited cacophony of the extended Green family, whose sniffling little ones skittered down the corridors, dodging piles of donated clothes and accumulated trash while a mix of Ashanti and Ray Charles bounced between multiple boomboxes. Mr. Cooper and Ms. McNeely kept their distance, and the elder Mr. Johnson made a point of letting Mr. Phelps, the mission director, know he was not raised like the Green children. As for the Greens, they were a world unto themselves, and took pains to make it clear that they were working people who were accustomed to doing as they pleased. ''I had money in the bank and a big-screen TV,'' Mr. Green said. ''I didn't wear nothing but Austin Reeds.'' He walked with a limp owing to a fall he took at the race track, and slept on a brown plaid sofa in his street clothes in the dormitory's living room. His room was where the building's only television was. He did not want anyone to sit on his bed, meaning the sofa, so most residents did not feel comfortable going in there. It was hard for anyone to watch the grainy images of Dr. Phil or college football, knowing Mr. Green was sitting there feeling invaded. ''Whose name it is on the door?'' he would ask anyone who took liberties in his space. With his gray stubble and baseball cap, he made it his business to root out slovenly habits and had regular run-ins with the people on the second floor. ''You done left your trash by the stairs,'' Mr. Green once said to Nitayu Johnson, a second-floor resident. ''You a damn lie,'' she shot back at him. They had all become an accidental family, and everyone was going stir crazy. One day ran into another. ''After we eat,'' Mr. Cooper said, describing his day, ''we go straight up our room and lay across the bed. We be looking at the clock and say, man, it's just seven o'clock. We trying to figure out how to go to sleep at seven o'clock. You read, you talk, you thinking you burned off an hour, and it's just 15 minutes.'' Mr. Cooper was dying for a newspaper to know what was going on in the world since he could not watch the news in the living room. In the next room, Charles Johnson was arguing with his grandfather over the date. ''We don't know what day it is,'' the younger Mr. Johnson said. ''We don't know what time it is. We don't know nothing.'' ''They do so tell us the time,'' the elder Mr. Johnson said, defending the mission. ''And I got a calendar in my bag somewhere to look up the day it is.'' Everyone was trying to figure out the next step, hoping it would be permanent or at least the last stop before their return to New Orleans. They had to think about where they knew people, where they could get work, where relatives and friends were going. Some were stuck in their decision-making because they had not yet heard what had become of certain loved ones. The elder Mr. Johnson still had not reached his sons. Nitayu Johnson had an aunt who had been airlifted to Texas. But the aunt was in a shelter, too, and did not know where she was going next. So Ms. Johnson did not know whether to join her aunt in Texas or wait for her to get settled somewhere else. All she knew was she was not staying in Oklahoma. The Greens were trying to make the best of it in the area. They had decided to settle in Arkansas, in Fort Smith, the biggest town near the mission, about an hour's drive east, partly because of the complexities of moving so many people somewhere else at once. But they were having a hard time finding a place to live. The sheer number of evacuees who had come through Fort Chaffee after the storm meant a lot of competition and red tape. Meanwhile, the Green daughters were hearing that evacuees were getting all kinds of help in Atlanta. Their older sister, Phoebe, had fled there with her family before the storm and had already settled in a house in the suburbs. Suddenly, the decisions people had made in the fateful hours before and after the storm, which shelter they had happened upon to ride it out, who had happened to pick them up from their rooftop and the destination of a bus or plane they had happened to be shuffled onto, began to hit them, and the Greens began to feel they were in a less fortunate position. Whenever a lead in Arkansas fell through, as was often the case, all they could talk about was getting to Atlanta. The elder Johnsons were more determined than anyone to get to their home in the engulfed Lower Ninth Ward. They never considered not going back. They did not let other cities or states distract them. They never veered from a decision to get to San Antonio, near some of Mrs. Johnson's relatives, and to plot a course home from there. Mr. Cooper and Ms. McNeely, both in their 50's, were equally focused. They were talking about going to New York. A place called Schenectady. Somewhere near Albany, Mr. Cooper said. He had a contact there and knew he could find work. It was a purely practical choice, and he was grateful to have it. But he was grieving the loss of the familiar. ''You were in your little world,'' said Mr. Cooper, a lean man with a shaved head and a salt-and-pepper beard. ''You know where to go and what to watch out for. You know the people you can count on and the people to leave alone. ''Now you got to make new friends, build up new trusts, learn to blend in,'' he continued. ''If I was a young man, I would never go back. But we just young enough to where we can start over and just old enough to where a few more years down the road we couldn't adjust.'' He did not arrive in Oklahoma with Schenectady on his mind. ''You uprooted,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''It takes you a while to figure out what the hell happened to you. It's going to take months to realize, My life was wiped out.'' But after a few days, he had had a chance to think. He remembered the Episcopal priest he had worked for in New Orleans who had moved to Schenectady years ago. The priest said he would always have a job there if he wanted to come. One day, he was sorting through some scraps of papers in his room at the mission. ''I said, 'I wish I could find his number,''' Mr. Cooper recalled. ''As I was dumping some trash out, a piece of paper with his phone number fell out. It was telling me to go to Schenectady.'' He paused and looked down. ''We was comfortable,'' he said. ''My little job was right up the street. We were around friends. We had family. In Schenectady, there's no family, only one friend. But Schenectady is just slow enough to where we can be comfortable and fast enough to where we can be happy.'' His face brightened, as if he was trying to make himself feel better about the move. But he was worried about Ms. McNeely. She was so frail that she was having trouble getting up the steps. Diabetes had taken all her teeth. ''She can't take too much cold,'' he said, ''but I guess she gon' have to learn to live with it.'' The Hunt for a Home In time, two groups formed at the mission: those who were looking to stay in the area, and those who were not. Those who were staying had first dibs at getting into Fort Smith whenever a van showed up. One morning as the van prepared to leave, Charles Johnson climbed aboard. He said he wanted to go into town with the group looking at houses. He was not looking at houses. He was biding his time until he could get to Texas. On this day, he just wanted to see traffic and people again. He wanted to go for the ride. Mr. Green hit the ceiling. ''Go for a ride?'' he said. ''This ain't no excursion. This ain't no picnic. We going to do business.'' Marquita Carter, an evacuee whom the Greens had taken under their wing during the storm, looked down her handwritten list of rentals in the dog-eared folder she carried with her everywhere. ''Here's a triplex with a washer and dryer hookup that's newly renovated,'' Ms. Carter told Kandice Green, one of Mr. Green's daughters, who was reserving judgment. Somewhere between the abandoned Texaco station and the battered sign to Badger Lee Baptist Church, spontaneous chirping broke out all over the van. The cell phones were in receiving range again. ''We back in civilization!'' Ms. Carter said. Day after day, armed with the federal Section 8 vouchers given to hurricane victims, the Greens searched for apartments. Some places looked to be falling apart. Some looked fine but had a deposit already or did not take Section 8. One day, they found the perfect arrangement: a brick duplex, newer construction, with plenty of space. ''Daddy, this is beautiful,'' the Green daughters said as they picked out rooms. ''I finally feel hopeful,'' Ms. Carter said. Mr. Green said he would take it. His voucher would cover the $750 rent for his unit, and his daughters' vouchers would take care of theirs. But the next day, they found out the vouchers were of little use. The local housing authority would not permit the Greens to use the vouchers to rent the duplex because it said the units were overpriced. With the arrival of several thousand evacuees to a town of 80,000, landlords were jacking up the rents all over town, the authorities said. ''They think just because these people have vouchers, they can charge New Orleans prices,'' said Michael Fuchtman, a counselor at the Fort Smith-Sebastian County Housing Authority. ''We had a lady charging $980 for a three-bedroom house that would normally go for half that. That was a total no way.'' Later that day, Kandice Green and Ms. Carter ran into trouble with two apartments they thought were theirs. ''We'll need a credit check and a criminal background check,'' Cyndi Glass, the resident manager, said. ''Any felonies, we can't rent to you. It's going to take three days to get that information back from Louisiana.'' With the stacks of other applications on Ms. Glass's desk, the apartments would probably be rented by then. ''Well, it's not my fault,'' Ms. Glass said. ''It's not your fault. It's nobody's fault. We've been told not to veer from the policy.'' Ms. Carter got up and left. She was insulted at the very suggestion that she was a felon. ''I wanted to climb behind that desk and knock that woman out,'' she said. After so many near misses, the two women were heartbroken. On the ride back to the mission, they sat slumped in their seats, quiet. Ms. Carter rubbed her eyes. Kandice Green stared out the window at the cows and hay bales in the pasture. The happiest evacuees at the mission were the Johnsons -- Mr. Johnson, in particular. A slightly built man of 72, he was so happy to have found his wife and to have a bed to sleep in, it did not much matter where it was so long as it was not his house in the Ninth Ward. ''This is my world right in here,'' Mr. Johnson said of his corner of a dorm room, a double mattress on the bottom bunk with donated suitcases filled with donated clothes neatly stacked in the corner. But when he rested his eyes during breaks in the day, he relived his regrets, second-guessing himself on the minutest decisions. Perhaps they could have fled sooner if he had not set the radio on the dresser. It ran on batteries, and they were depending on it for news after the television went out. But the dresser tilted over, and the radio fell in the water. They ended up being rescued through a vent in the roof. Then he ''misplaced'' his wife, as he put it. When the Superdome was emptied, he had no choice but to do as he was told: board the plane to San Antonio and hope she made it there, too. But she didn't. Their eventual reunion did not quiet his mind. ''I be laying here 'fore I fall asleep,'' he said. ''I be thinking about things. You think about little things, what I have to do when I get back. What I'm gon' find. I think about my sons. I haven't talked to them, but I know they safe.'' ''My mind is on what I'm gon' do when I get back,'' he continued. ''I want to find her wedding band. I had some silver dimes I want to find.'' ''And my mink coat,'' Mrs. Johnson interjected. ''Oh, you can forget about that,'' he said. ''You can just put that out your mind.'' A New Subject Matter Life began to stir every morning at 6:00 when the five little girls in the group roused themselves to go to school. They got up in the dark, hours before they would have back home, to board a yellow bus to a little country school in Marble City, Okla., about five miles down the road. The teachers and principal were overjoyed at their arrival. The school had lost half its student population in the last generation as people had left the strip-mining and cattle country for better jobs elsewhere. The school had been hoping for maybe a hundred new students from the storm, but fate had brought them only five. They arrived a month into the school year, and there was no telling how long they would attend. Still, there was an assembly to announce that children from Louisiana were arriving. Teachers warned their students not to talk about the hurricane unless the new students brought it up first. The children piled quarters and nickels on the new students' desks for them to buy soda pop with. Despite the warnings, one student could not help asking Corille Johnson if she had come from the ''tsunami.'' Corille did not talk much about the hurricane in class or with other students. She clung to her teacher, Amy Blalock, and sat in the third row right next to the teacher's desk. When the math lesson rolled around, it was as if everything was normal again. Corille was good in math and became one of the children, like Sam and Winter and Dakota, who kept their hands in the air when numbers were on the blackboard. ''Ooh, I know, I know!'' she said, her arm stretched high. Things were different in reading. They were studying nouns. The children were to give examples of nouns. The other children said ''school'' or ''gym.'' ''Her nouns were 'Convention Center' and 'Superdome,''' Mrs. Blalock said. In art, Corille drew pictures of a tornado and said, ''This is what happened to New Orleans.'' ''And every once in a while, out of the blue,'' Mrs. Blalock said, ''she'll blurt out, 'We don't know where my brother is.''' By late September, Mr. Green was rethinking his game plan. He was coming off another empty-handed day of looking. He had tried to make himself feel better about Arkansas, but things were not working out. ''I'm thinking about New York,'' he said. ''Or California. Or Indiana. I'll just get me a ticket and get on out of here. This always was a rotten state for blacks. I remember when old Orval Faubus blocked the school doors in Little Rock.'' A white Arkansan sitting on a nearby bench overheard his ranting. ''I think Fort Smith is one of the best places you could live in this country,'' he said. ''Yeah?'' Mr. Green said. ''What factories they got here?'' ''Whirlpool,'' the man said. ''Planters Peanuts.'' Mr. Green, still steaming, seemed not to hear him. ''I knew this was a rotten state,'' he said. The local man got up. ''We've treated those people terrific over here,'' he said, and walked away. With each passing day, Mr. Green could feel the sympathy draining away. His daughter Serrita had a run-in at the bus station when she went to pick up her two oldest children, who were with their father during the storm. A man looked at them and said, loud enough for them to hear, ''Why didn't they just get out?'' Serrita had to keep from cursing the man. Her family had done exactly what the authorities had told them to do. They rode out the hurricane in a school gymnasium and still found themselves vagabonds. ''We would love nothing more than to go back to our homes,'' she said. They were beginning to feel that because of the growing impatience of the locals, the conflicting government relief rules and the competition from other evacuees, everything was conspiring against them. To add to their anger and disappointment, they were hearing rumors that the governor and the president had told businesses to do everything they could to help them get situated, but they did not see where that call was being lived up to. Kandice Green called her sister Phoebe in Atlanta. ''They straight up look you in the face,'' she began, ''and say, 'I don't care what the governor say, I don't care what the president say, you not getting it.''' Each day, as he rustled up church vans to get them into town or made canned spaghetti they chose not to eat, Mr. Phelps, the mission director, had mainly one thing on his mind: how much this was costing and how he would get reimbursed from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Red Cross or whoever had the authority. The electric bill for running the dormitory in September would be $400 or $500. And his wife, Sue, the part-time office manager, had been putting in 30 extra hours a week. ''That's a cost I hope we can recoup,'' he said. There was also the cost of the part-time cook and the salary and benefits for Allison Beavers, the program director, who seemingly took care of everything, including consoling the babies and helping to navigate the housing bureaucracy. ''It's a real energy taker,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''It's not our job to do this. It's not that we don't want to do it, but it's also important to get a thank you back. All it would take would be one thank you.'' Everything had taken up more of his time than he had anticipated. ''I spent four hours trying to coordinate transportation for Serrita's two children from Louisiana on the Greyhound bus,'' he said. ''Four hours. That's not in my schedule.'' Generosity Wearing Thin Just as the needs grew more complex, the help began to wane. ''Everybody was pumped up the first week,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''We had lots of volunteers in the beginning. Now the sense of dropping everything to come help is not as great as at the beginning. Volunteers are driving great distances and having to pay their own gas and tolls. I don't think it's our responsibility to give, give, give and not see motivation on the evacuees' level.'' Every so often, the frustration on both sides came to a boil. Mr. Phelps approached Mr. Green in the cafeteria one morning after a typically low turnout and asked if his daughters were up at the dorm. They needed to get into town for their children's immunization shots. ''I don't know,'' Mr. Green said. ''I'm here and they're there. They grown. I don't tell them what to do. They got minds of their own.'' ''Well, they're your relatives,'' Mr. Phelps said, ''not mine.'' Mr. Phelps walked back to the kitchen, and Mr. Green rolled his eyes. It was clear as the fourth week approached that the arrangement could not last much longer. ''We want to get them placed so they can go on with their lives,'' Mr. Phelps said, ''and we can go on with ours.'' He said as much to Mr. Green when he asked what he was doing to find an apartment. To Mr. Phelps, the Greens were not looking hard enough, and the options were becoming fewer because other evacuees were taking what was left. ''Why are you waiting?'' Mr. Phelps asked. ''You have to be out there looking. If you're sitting there waiting for something to be handed to you, it's not going to happen.'' ''Look,'' Mr. Green told him, ''I want to get out of here just as bad as you want me out of here.'' Later that week, after another discouraging visit to the housing authority, Mr. Green was so fed up, he told Mr. Phelps, ''If I'm not out of here by Wednesday, get me a bus ticket anywhere.'' It was going on an entire month since the day they had arrived. Pressure was brewing on the Gulf Coast from a new wave of evacuees from Hurricane Rita. Those at the mission who had figured out where they were going next began peeling off. The Johnsons were told that the Red Cross was arranging for them to fly to San Antonio. Word came that Mr. Cooper and Ms. McNeely were going to have to travel to Schenectady by bus. It could take a day and a half. There was a question as to whether Ms. McNeely could make it and how to keep her insulin refrigerated all that time. ''It's 26 stops,'' Ms. McNeely said. ''But to get up out of here, I'll get my insulin and I'll chance it.'' The Johnsons had to leave the mission in a hurry. They would be staying in a Motel 6 off the expressway in Fort Smith. With more evacuees headed their way, Mr. Phelps said, there was a fear they might not get a room close to the airport if they waited too much longer. When it was time, Jim Potts, a volunteer in a T-shirt with the letters ''CIA'' printed on it, for ''Christ Is Alive,'' drove up to take them away. ''Oh lord, this is a mess,'' Mrs. Johnson said as her husband wound down the steps loaded with donated luggage to yet another temporary destination not of their choosing and still not home. Mr. Cooper, baseball cap on backward, lit a cigarette and stood watching them load up the red church van, which said ''New Beginnings.'' Mr. Johnson went from person to person on the porch and hugged everyone. His eyes welled up. ''All right, brother, you be good,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''I'm a miss you, man,'' Mr. Johnson said to his floor mate. ''I'm a miss all of y'all.'' He turned to Nitayu, who lived at the opposite end of the hall. ''I'll see you, babe,'' he said. ''I'll see you again.'' He walked across the porch. ''Take it easy,'' he told Mr. Harris, Mr. Green's wordless father-in-law, who barely looked up. As the driver turned on the engine, Charles Johnson blew Corille, Nitayu's daughter, a kiss. Nitayu did not turn in her seat. Mr. Harris just sat hunched over in his metal folding chair, a cigarette burning between his fingers. ''I'll see you, man,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''I'll see you when we get home.'' Corille went running alongside the van. She waved both arms in the"
"Hundreds of men in the Guatemalan Indian village of Panabáj hacked with hoes and shovels on Saturday at the river of mud about a half mile wide and as deep as 20 feet that hit their town last week. As rescue workers and relatives of the dead arrived Saturday, villagers handed out native herbs and told the visitors to press the leaves into their noses to fend off the smell of decomposing bodies. At a jury-rigged mobile mortuary, 10 husky men in the back of a pickup truck, equipped with a few crude coffins, long nylon bags and a gallon of bleach stood ready to haul decaying remains away. ''There is no time for funerals,'' said Nicolás Pablo Tzina, the leader of the crew. ''But we want to find our beloved people and bury them with dignity.'' Mayor Diego Esquina of Santiago Atitlán, the nearby municipality that oversees the village, estimated that as many as 400 people lay dead beneath the mudslide, making this one of the areas hardest hit by the rainstorms spawned last week by Hurricane Stan. The rains, which started gently last weekend and then turned torrential, caused a trail of death and destruction from southern Mexico -- where an estimated 20 people were killed, 70 rivers overran their banks, 30 bridges fell and more than 150,000 people were left homeless -- to El Salvador, where an estimated 71 people died and about 65,000 were left homeless. Newspapers across Central America described the storm as the worst natural disaster to hit the region since Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 storm with winds of up to 180 miles per hour that killed about 9,000 people in 1998. In Guatemala, however, Stan, a much weaker Category 1 hurricane that swept across the region with 80 m.p.h. winds, hurt worse. Vice President Eduardo Stein described the damage as ''colossal'' in a television interview on Sunday. Guatemalan authorities reported that the death toll went up again on Sunday, to 652 people from the 508 that had been reported Saturday. About 130,000 had been left homeless in Guatemala, authorities said, and three million more had been left without electricity, water and other basic services. Landslides, Mr. Stein said, had been reported on hundreds of mountains and had damaged nearly 2,500 miles of highway, leaving most of the entire northern province of San Marcos cut off from aid. An American helicopter unit from Joint Task Force Bravo at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras made two attempts on Sunday to fly to San Marcos through the cloud-covered skies, and rescue at least 30 children in need of medical attention. But low cloud cover and a continuing downpour stopped that and numerous other rescue efforts. ''The magnitude of the disaster is enormous,'' Mr. Stein said. ''In the high plateau we are still in real emergency, still experiencing successive damages, still experiencing landslides on some of the mountains.'' The impoverished people of Panabáj, a village of tiny houses made from reeds and tin that has been buried since Tuesday by at least 20 feet of mud, seemed to have been left almost entirely to save themselves, except for a half-dozen British tourists who joined the rescue effort. Some residents said Saturday that the government had abandoned them. But others said they had refused government help because the village harbored deep resentment against the government, a lingering legacy of this country's brutal civil war. In 1990, soldiers reportedly killed at least nine peasant farmers in Panabáj whom the soldiers had suspected of being guerrillas. ''The army left very bad memories,'' said Pedro Mendoza, the leader of a local security committee. ''They cannot come here. The people will not accept that.'' Still, the people of Panabáj were clearly overwhelmed by their task. Hundreds of them climbed up onto the mud and began digging for the dead with little more than shovels and hoes. There was only one power saw in the village, and its owner ran from one spot to another to help rescue teams cut apart heavy tree trunks. So far, they had recovered 72 bodies, mostly women and children. Most people were asleep, rescue workers said, when the mudslide hit about 3 a.m. Thursday. One woman, they said, was found with a 2-year-old in her arms, and a baby in a shawl on her back. The mother was trying to run from the mudslide, one of the rescue workers said. But a tree trunk, so heavy it took 10 men to lift it, fell on top of them. By Saturday, however, the rescue efforts were bearing little fruit. Workers had found only one body all day. It was another child, barely old enough to walk. Local authorities announced that they would give up on finding any more and end the digging. The remaining bodies, they said, had been underground so long, and were probably so badly decomposed, that they would be hard to find and even harder to recognize. ''Panabáj will no longer exist,'' said Mayor Esquina said in an interview with The Associated Press. ''We are asking that it be declared a cemetery. We are tired. We no longer know where to dig.'' Correction: December 3, 2005, Saturday An article on Oct. 10 about Guatemalan villagers trying to dig out bodies of people killed in a mudslide in an area hit by rainstorms from Hurricane Stan incorrectly described an episode in 1990 in which troops killed people in the village, Panabáj. The villagers were killed when troops fired into a crowd of protesters, and reports at the time said there were as many as 13 dead. They were not farmers suspected of being guerrillas. A reader reported the error at the time, but his e-mail message was misdirected at The Times."
"Confronted with unprecedented needs that emerged after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the American Red Cross has been forced for the first time in its 124-year history to borrow a large sum of money to complete its disaster relief work, the organization said Thursday. The Red Cross set a $2.3 billion fund-raising goal in the aftermath of the two hurricanes, more than twice the amount it raised after the Sept. 11 attacks, Carrie Martin, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said. But so far, the organization has raised just $1.3 billion. It says an additional $500 million or so is still on the way. The borrowing was first reported Thursday night by The Washington Post. ''This is the biggest disaster the Red Cross and the country have ever faced,'' Ms. Martin said. She said the group had already borrowed about $340 million so it could maintain programs it had committed itself to provide. The Red Cross, Ms. Martin said, still hopes to raise an additional $400 million or so, allowing it to pay back the loans and complete its relief effort. But these figures do not include assistance that the organization will provide to victims of Hurricane Wilma in Florida, she said. ''We will be looking to going back to donors who have already given to ask them to dig a little deeper and we will be looking for new donors,'' she said. The single biggest piece of aid the Red Cross is providing to victims of Katrina and Rita is cash assistance, which has been given to more than one million families, the organization said. These grants, which average $1,000 to $1,200 per family, will ultimately cost the organization an estimated $1.5 billion. The Red Cross also opened hundreds of emergency shelters for displaced families, serving 20 million meals in sites spread across 27 states over a six-week period, the organization said. Some of the $340 million in borrowing was to cover a hotel program that the Red Cross will manage on behalf of the federal government. It will be reimbursed for this expense, which so far has cost about $150 million. The Red Cross this week turned that program over to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which now is managing it, providing housing in motels or hotels for about 200,000 people. Confidence in the Red Cross in recent years has suffered because of questions about the strength of its management. The agency also significantly overstated the population it was serving in its hotel program, estimating as recently as earlier this month that there were 600,000 people in the hotels, when the number was more likely about 200,000, an error that Red Cross officials attributed to a miscalculation by its executives of data provided to it by a contractor. STORM AND CRISIS: CHARITIES"
"The green fields of sugar cane stretched to the horizon here on the southern edge of Lake Okeechobee. Normally the stalks rise ramrod straight, like battalions of soldiers in orderly ranks. But after being beaten for hours by winds of more than 100 miles an hour from Hurricane Wilma, the columns of cane bent forward in defeat on Thursday, some nearly flat against the rich black soil of the Everglades, others tangled and twisted in sad bunches. ''This is going to have a huge economic impact, not only on growers, but on workers living paycheck to paycheck,'' said Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, as he visited the emergency operations center in nearby Clewiston and a shelter for storm victims. Sugar cane is one of the most important crops in the state, and agriculture vies with tourism as the main engine in Florida's economy, which is valued at $50 billion annually. The losses in the region are going to run into the tens of millions if not billions of dollars, government officials and business people said. They will be among the most severe consequences of a hurricane that swept the southern portion of Florida on Monday and left the state in logistical knots days later. More than two million homes and businesses were without electricity on Thursday, down from the peak of nearly four million. After getting off to a rough start, the distribution of basic supplies like ice, water and emergency meals was more organized. But vast lines for gasoline could still be seen in the three largest counties in the state, Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. Government officials said that restoring power to gas stations was a top priority now that most hospitals had electricity. Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, the arrival point for most of the region's fuel, reopened to tankers on Thursday, and four pulled in. But fewer trucks than usual took the gas out to service stations because many stations remained closed. Steve Gordon, a diesel mechanic born in Jamaica, said he waited in line for gas in Fort Lauderdale for four and a half hours early Thursday. ''I only got five gallons; that was the limit,'' Mr. Gordon said. So after driving to a livestock farm here on the edge of Lake Okeechobee to buy a goat to serve after his nephew's funeral, he headed for a gas station. Only a few were open, but the lines were much shorter, and Mr. Gordon hoped to fill his tank. President Bush visited the region in the afternoon, surveying the damage from a helicopter and stopping by a Baptist church in Pompano Beach that was feeding storm victims. Joined by his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, the president tried to pacify the angry legions lacking electricity, potable water and gas. ''Things don't happen instantly, but they are happening,'' President Bush said. ''People are getting fed. Soon more and more houses will have electricity. Their lives will get back to normal.'' In South Bay, population 4,500, and nearby Clewiston, population 15,000, some hardware and grocery stores opened Thursday and several filling stations were selling gas. During the night, the first government food supplies reached Clewiston. On Thursday morning, more than 100 cars lined up for water, ice and boxes of chicken stew and barbecued beef. Lolita Williams, 42, inched toward the food and water in a tan Pontiac with three other women and two small children. ''I'm hungry till my head hurts,'' Ms. Williams said. The area, heavily populated by migrant workers from Mexico, Jamaica and Haiti, is already one of the poorest in the state. Most fieldworkers have lost nearly a week's pay. Nestor Betancos, who drives sugar cane workers to their fields in a bus, said his bosses had told him, ''We ain't going to be able to work for two weeks to two months.'' ''The cane is all lying down,'' he said. ''And the mills have been damaged, too.'' In addition to sugar, oranges, ornamental plants and vegetables like lettuce, peppers and corn are grown in this area. Many of the vegetables are sold in New York. On Thursday afternoon, Bobby Tony Smith, the city manager of South Bay, paused in a sport utility vehicle west of town as a soldier with an M-16 rifle and three town employees distributed water and food to homes along a main road. Looking out at the damaged cane fields, Mr. Smith said he could not say how many millions of dollars the losses would be. But, he said, ''The windshield view suggests mass devastation to the crops.'' Rick Henderson, the president of Henderson's Sani Service Systems, which provides portable toilets for fieldworkers, said, ''The farmers lost probably 80 percent of their crop.'' ''I imagine this is going to kill our business,'' said Mr. Henderson, who has lived in the area all his life. ''When the farmers get hit, it has a domino effect on the whole area.'' Cuba Accepts U.S. Aid WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (Reuters) -- Cuba, the longtime American foe whose own offer of help was snubbed by Washington after Hurricane Katrina, has for the first time ''in memory'' accepted American disaster aid, the State Department said Thursday. A State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said a three-member American assessment team was on standby to go to Cuba to see what was needed after flooding from the storm."
"They build their houses on stilts here on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico and the Everglades, and a lot of the old-timers figure they can withstand just about any kind of wind or flooding. Mayor Sammy Hamilton Jr. and officials of Collier County want everyone to evacuate as Hurricane Wilma bears down on this village of about 700 and other parts of Florida's Gulf Coast. Many of those in mobile homes and seasonal residents have already left, Mr. Hamilton said. But it is another story when it comes to people who were born and raised here, many of whom have made their living for decades as fishermen and tour guides on boats that snake through bushy mangrove channels filled with osprey, blue heron, alligators and wild boar. ''I'm going to get everything that will blow away nailed down and get in the house and stay there,'' said Bob Wells, the owner of a real estate agency here, whose house sits 9 to 10 feet above ground on wood pilings. Mr. Hamilton, who wears jeans and shoulder-length dark hair and has been mayor for 12 years, said he was going to go around town Saturday morning to try to persuade people to take shelter elsewhere. ''But, honestly,'' he said, ''I believe a lot of them are going to stay. The old-timers feel like they've been through it all.'' The mayor himself is planning to stay. His three-story house sits on the edge of the Barron River, looking over lush mangroves stretching toward the Ten Thousand Islands section of the Gulf of Mexico, not far from the southern tip of Florida. But the house is ''built better than a bomb shelter,'' Mr. Hamilton said Friday in his office in the white-columned City Hall, flanked by royal palms and pink hibiscus hedges. As Mr. Hamilton spoke, a light rain was falling and Hurricane Wilma was hitting the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico with 140-mile-an-hour winds. Forecasters said the storm would probably hit Florida early next week, but they were unsure which day. The mayor, a former fisherman who now runs a tour boat company and turns on an Elvis Presley tape every time he gets into his car, said he figured it was his duty to stay. ''I need to be able to report back to the county what's going on,'' Mr. Hamilton said. No, he said, he did not think he was setting a bad example by failing to heed his own advice and get out of town. He had things to do, he said. He is coordinating with county officials to send the three fire engines stationed in Everglades City to places where they will not be flooded, and on Saturday morning he has buses coming to pick up sick and elderly residents and anyone else who wants a ride to a hurricane shelter. ''We're well prepared,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''We can't take it easy, because we're at sea level. We could get 16 to 18 feet of water. We can take a little wind, but we can't handle the water.'' Everglades City has been lucky with hurricanes. The last big one, Hurricane Donna in 1960, buried the town under 12 feet of water. But no one died and most of the houses survived, Mr. Hamilton said. He was 19 then. He and his family took shelter in City Hall. ''Me and another guy swam to the supermarket to get food,'' he said. Along one of the town's waterways, Travis Goff, in graying beard and a khaki shirt, was butchering a wild hog. Mr. Goff runs a 40-foot pontoon tour boat. If he left, he said, it would be at the last minute. ''We've got lots of boats and equipment,'' he said. ''The more you move, the more you've got to bring back.'' Gary Miller, 61, and Mark Anderson, 50, two retired fishermen, stopped by with a big bottle of cola and some plastic foam cups. They live in a motor home. ''We're leaving,'' Mr. Miller said. Mr. Wells, the real estate agency owner, was a teenager when Hurricane Donna filled his family's home with three feet of water. ''I've never left'' when a storm is coming, he said. ''Of course it's dangerous,'' Mr. Wells said. ''But these people's granddaddies came down here 100 years ago.'' Their lives were filled with risk, he said. ''If they stepped on a nail, it meant their life. They've seen storms come and go. This is their home. You live in New York. I think that's pretty dangerous. Why don't you leave?'' STORM ANS CRISIS: PREPARATIONS"
"Hurricane Wilma slammed into the Yucatán coast with howling fury Friday, flooding streets, downing trees and power lines and stranding thousands of tourists and residents in crowded shelters. There were no immediate reports of deaths here from the hurricane, a Category 4 storm that killed 13 people in Haiti and Jamaica. But local officials feared it would cause extensive damage to the resort towns along the coast, before turning sharply eastward for a possible landfall in Florida on Monday. In Cancún, the streets were covered in more than four feet of water in some places by noon, and wind gusts of up to 110 miles an hour screamed down the streets, uprooting trees and tearing off roofs. ''It's very strong, only a little less powerful than Gilbert,'' said Oscar Fuentes Mariles, a meteorologist with the Mexican National Center for the Prevention of Disaster, referring to the devastating storm that hammered the peninsula 17 years ago. But officials here said the storm was unique, in their memory, because the eye was tracking right up the coastline, producing heavy onshore winds that could create a catastrophic storm surge. And, the storm's slow progress was bad news for residents, officials said, because the area could be trapped under the deluge for more than 24 hours. They said the 500-mile-wide hurricane was moving unusually slowly, about 3 m.p.h., and was expected to spin up the coast, its eye either coming inland a few miles or staying just offshore. ''It continues to be very erratic,'' Mayor Francisco Alor Quesada of Cancún said. With sustained winds of up to 125 m.p.h., the storm was expected to wreak havoc on the resorts of Cozumel, as well as Playa del Carmen and Puerto Moreles. Seven people were badly injured in Playa del Carmen when a propane tank exploded. On Thursday, officials evacuated all the seaside hotels and urged people living in flimsy houses to go to cement-walled shelters. More than 71,000 people, among them 21,700 tourists, crammed into cultural centers, schools and other government buildings, the government said. At the Casa de Cultura in Cancún, hundreds of tourists who had been staying in luxury rooms at the Riu Cancún Hotel were sleeping on thin poolside mattresses while the wind picked up outside. Many said their flights had been canceled. Others were stubbornly hoping to finish out package vacations they had paid for. ''I was warned ahead of time that it is the hurricane season, but I thought, 'What's the likelihood of it hitting Cancún,''' said Rodney Bublitz, 75, a retired outboard-motor salesman from Wisconsin who had come with his wife, Marion, to celebrate their 51st wedding anniversary. ''Guess I'm unlucky. That's why I don't play the lottery.'' As Friday afternoon wore on, the rising winds turned the usually tranquil air in this city into slanting gray horizontal rains that slashed at houses, people and trees. The civil protection authorities suspended efforts to clear away trees and downed power lines. The storm surge inundated the highway serving the line of big resort hotels near the ocean, as well as low lying areas of the city, officials said. Power was out for 94 percent of the city, which meant a majority of families were also living without water because they lacked electricity to power pumps. Officials here, who successfully managed Hurricane Emily this year with no loss of life, said they had never faced such a dangerous storm. Their faces were grim at a meeting in the Cancún City Hall at noon, when it was announced that the police could no longer remove people lingering in dangerous zones without endangering themselves. ''From the beginning, we said the circumstance that we would face in Cancún is like nothing we have ever faced from nature,'' Mayor Alor said. STORM AND CRISIS: NEW HURRICANE"
"Kansas City Chiefs tight end Jason Dunn said he was a little concerned when he arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Friday feeling lethargic after a three-hour flight with his teammates. After all, in less than six hours, the Chiefs were to play the Miami Dolphins. ''You feel like you're moving slow,'' Dunn said. ''And really, it took me until the second half to feel good, to get my legs back under me.'' With the Category 4 Hurricane Wilma working its way from Mexico, Kansas City's game against the Miami Dolphins was moved up two days. The Chiefs responded by winning, 30-20, on a rainy night at Dolphins Stadium. Afterward, Carl Peterson, the Chiefs' president and general manager, crowed to anyone who would listen, ''We're starting a trend: travel and play on the same day.'' The Chiefs went through a lot just to get to the game, according to Bob Moore, the team's public-relations director. On Wednesday night, they were told by the National Football League that Friday was the only day that had been ruled out for play. They were asked to prepare for the possibility of playing host to the game or playing at a neutral site. So Moore and others made dozens of phone calls, meeting well into the night on Wednesday and on Thursday morning. At about 10 a.m. on Thursday, they were told that they were going to Miami to play Friday. That left the Chiefs with one regular practice day: Wednesday. On Thursday, they had a walk-through, and then Coach Dick Vermeil sent his players home to pack for an airport rendezvous at 8 a.m. on Friday. ''Now the players are going to say we don't need to practice on Thursday,'' Vermeil said afterward with a chuckle. ''When you win, it doesn't matter when you play.'' The Chiefs' charter flight left at 10 a.m. and arrived in Fort Lauderdale after 1 p.m., Moore said. The team was bused to its hotel, where the players tried to relax. Some attended a chapel service, and beds were made available for others. After their pregame meal, they left for Dolphins Stadium at about 3:30 for the 7 o'clock game. The Chiefs (4-2) showed no sign of jet lag in scoring on the game's first possession. They drove 80 yards in 8 plays, with Priest Holmes getting the touchdown on a 5-yard run. ''Particularly under the circumstances, it was important that we show something early,'' said quarterback Trent Green, who threw for 289 yards and completed passes to nine receivers. Miami (2-4) did not come to life until the second quarter, when Olindo Mare's 33-yard field goal, set up by Wes Welker's 47-yard punt return, made the score 7-3. The Chiefs countered with another 80-yard drive, which was capped by Larry Johnson's 2-yard dive to make the score 14-3. A 23-yard field goal by Mare with 5 seconds remaining in the second quarter moved the Dolphins to 14-6. The third quarter opened spectacularly for Miami. On the first offensive play, the rookie running back Ronnie Brown started around left end. He was almost jolted off his feet by free safety Greg Wesley, but he regained his balance and raced 65 yards along the sideline for a touchdown that made the score 14-13. That was as close as the Dolphins got. The Chiefs needed just two plays -- a 24-yard reception by Dunn and a 35-yard touchdown run by Holmes -- to restore their 8-point lead. They later added three field goals by Lawrence Tynes. Holmes rushed for 90 yards on 18 carries, and Johnson had 93 on 23 carries. Brown finished with 95 yards for the Dolphins, who got minus-1 yard rushing from Ricky Williams on 6 carries in his second game since his retirement and since the end of his four-game substance-abuse suspension. ''We got it done in the second half, when they probably thought we might be getting tired,'' Chiefs offensive tackle Willie Roaf said. ''We finished the game pounding the ball.'' The league's decision to play the game on Friday annoyed many Chiefs fans because it was televised within only a 75-mile radius of Kansas City, Moore said. ''We're a regional team,'' he said. ''We have a lot of fans in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Iowa. I've received 400 e-mails today. We're getting hammered by our fans.'' Perhaps the victory will soften that ill feeling. PRO FOOTBALL"
"Carmella Miranda followed her boyfriend three weeks ago from Ohio to a mobile-home park on the agricultural fringe of the Everglades. And then came Hurricane Wilma. ''I was just sitting on the bed in the middle room, rocking myself and biting my fingernails,'' Ms. Miranda said. With a huge crunch and a twisting of metal, the back room was sheared off and blown across the gravel roadway. Then, the trailer next door collapsed with a roar. And her roof began to peel away slowly. ''When I could see daylight through the gap, I thought that the end was here,'' Ms. Miranda said. ''I think I'm not going to live in a trailer anymore.'' Hurricanes blow without discrimination on rich and poor, but it is on the poorest and most vulnerable that the heaviest hammer often falls. Their homes tend to be flimsier and their neighborhoods more flood prone. The hurricane carved its way northeast on Monday across the tip of Florida, swirling the swamps, scattering debris, demolishing trees, flooding parking lots and lawns, snapping utility poles, shattering windows and paying special attention to this small town 30 miles northeast of Naples and home to thousands of migrant farm workers. ''About 80 percent of the homes in this community are mobile homes,'' said Manny Touron, principal of Immokalee High School, home of the Indians, 2004 Class 2A state football champions, and now the town's largest emergency shelter. ''Everywhere you look, you see mobile homes, mobile homes.'' A result of a Category 3 hurricane slamming into a town of mobile homes is a confusion of twisted metal, flying insulation and scattered vegetation. Trees lay across roads and atop homes; some seem to have landed with a sledgehammer's force, others with almost eerie gentleness. Diane Martinez, a Red Cross volunteer who manages the high school shelter, said injuries had been miraculously absent here. But a young woman two months pregnant lost her baby at the height of the storm. Pancho Diaz, who works for a company that cleans portable toilets, said curiosity led him to stay in his mobile home. ''I wanted to see what a hurricane was like,'' Mr. Diaz said. He found out. ''It was hairy,'' he said. The trailer shook. The wind played it like a clarinet. Finally, Mr. Diaz jumped in his truck and dashed to a nearby concrete structure. When he returned, he saw that a tree had bent back, its roots picking up one end of his trailer as neatly as a shovel prying up a brick. About 15,000 people live year-round in Immokalee, Mr. Touron said, many of them harvesting tomatoes, peppers and, in the spring, watermelons. Around this time of year, he said, 10,000 or so migrants come for the fall planting season. Not all the homes were destroyed. Many sustained just minor damage like tufts of insulation peeking from cracks and sheets of roofing flapping. Others escaped unharmed. But many were crushed by trees that had shaded them. Here and there were homes that seemed almost to have exploded, the walls flat on the ground and the furnishings jumbled. Pedro Bustamante, a migrant laborer, helped his wife carry a few possessions to a trailer a short walk away. The kitchen walls of the old trailer were gone, exposing a stove tossed sideways, a battered wood table and cabinets full of pots and dishes. An oatmeal box sat on the floor amid chili peppers and rice. If his son's wife had not given birth three days earlier, they would have probably tried to stay in their trailer, Mr. Bustamante said. Instead, they went to the shelter. ''We lost everything,'' he said as his wife emerged, a basket of sodden clothes on her shoulder. ''I'd better go find some food.'' Blocks away, near the remains of Alberto Salinas's trailer, music played on a truck in the driveway, and beers were passed around. ''All we can do is laugh about it and go on,'' David Salinas, the owner's son, said. ''What choice do we have?'' His father picked through the rubble, shaking his head that the storm had shattered his home and scattered his possessions without knocking the big-screen television set from its stand or scratching his beloved truck. But he pointed sadly at a fallen bookcase of videocassettes. ''My John Wayne collection,'' he said. ''I love John Wayne.'' As he spoke, another relative, Modesto Perez, drove up. ''I used to live in that trailer right next door until I moved to Fort Myers three weeks ago,'' Mr. Perez said, pointing to a green mobile home. ''I bought a house made of brick.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ON THE GROUND"
"Hurricane Wilma charged across South Florida in a few turbulent hours Monday morning, thrashing neighborhoods on both of the state's coasts, shattering high-rise windows, pushing seawater over much of the Florida Keys and knocking out power to an estimated 3.4 million homes and businesses. The storm entered the state shortly after dawn near Marco Island on the southwest Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane packing winds of up to 125 miles per hour. Soon, it was traveling at the rapid clip of 25 m.p.h. It carved a wide path northeast, roiling the Miami and Fort Lauderdale region and finally, seven hours later, roaring into the Atlantic Ocean near West Palm Beach, still a Category 2 storm with winds of 105 m.p.h. Most of the populated areas on the Gulf Coast were on the northern side of the storm, where conditions were less brutal. But they still saw widespread flooding, crumpled mobile homes, airborne roofs and countless downed trees. Early damage estimates were at least $2 billion. Fort Lauderdale and several other cities ordered residents to boil their tap water. In Miami, the winds shattered skyscraper windows, leaving a coating of glass shards along Brickell Avenue downtown. At least seven people were reported killed in the state. One man was killed in Coral Springs, near Fort Lauderdale, when a tree fell on him. In Palm Beach County, the police said two people were killed but they declined to say how; The Associated Press said one man died when an accident involving debris hurled him through his windshield as he approached his car. A woman from St. Johns County died in a car crash while evacuating, and a woman from Boynton Beach was killed when a glass door fell on her. In Collier County, a man was killed when his roof fell in, and another died of a heart attack while trying to walk through the storm. One woman, two months pregnant, miscarried after seeking refuge in a Red Cross shelter. Earlier, the storm left at least six people dead in Mexico and 13 in Jamaica and Haiti. As residents of Florida emerged to assess the damage, Gov. Jeb Bush said the state, which had days to prepare as the storm stalled over the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, had everything it needed to start recovering. ''We've got a response team that is second to none,'' Governor Bush said in a Tallahassee news conference. ''We will get through this storm and respond quickly.'' R. David Paulison, acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that since President Bush had declared the hurricane a major disaster, the agency would immediately begin distributing grants for temporary housing, home repairs and other storm-related expenses. Search and rescue teams had already been sent to Collier County in far southwestern Florida, where Hurricane Wilma entered the state, and would soon move into neighboring Lee County, Mr. Paulison said. Power was being restored in Collier County on Monday evening. ''Yes, we're tired of hurricanes,'' Mr. Paulison said. ''But we are prepared.'' At the height of the hurricane, the state's eighth in 15 months, an estimated 33,000 people had sought refuge in more than 120 shelters throughout the state, officials said. Governor Bush said that 3,100 National Guard members had been deployed in the affected areas and that another 3,500 were standing by. He also said 4,000 Florida utility workers were ready to start restoring electricity, as were 6,500 from other states. Hurricane Wilma also caused heavy flooding in Cuba as it made its way across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. Several low-lying neighborhoods had to be evacuated in Havana, where waves poured over the Malecon, the historic waterfront promenade, and inundated streets. The storm's rapid pace across Florida meant that there was less rainfall, with only 8 inches falling on Miami and 6.5 inches in Naples, a fraction of what soaked Yucatán. In Key West, at the far southern end of the chain of islands connected to the mainland by narrow causeways, officials said as many as 90 percent of the residents had ignored evacuation orders. It made for a tense morning, as the sea rushed into many sections of the island, pouring into homes and submerging vehicles. In Everglades City, a village of about 700 fishermen and tourist-boat operators in far southwestern Florida, a storm surge flooded streets and yards with up to four feet of water. But because most houses were built on stilts or mounds of earth, the damage was limited. Mayor Sammy Hamilton Jr. said that the cost of the damage would run into the millions but that the city would probably recovery quickly. ''Our city, in a month's time, will look like new,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''But it's going to be a lot of hard work and a lot of money.'' By late afternoon, much of the floodwater had receded in Everglades City. But trees were shredded and knocked down all over town. The aluminum roof of a small sightseeing boat had been crumpled and a flat-bottom skiff had been tossed up on the dock nearby. Long stretches of a dock running along the Barron River were torn up, and a few power poles were knocked askew, wires dangling from them. Many people evacuated from Everglades City before the hurricane. But some who remained said the storm was the worst since Hurricane Donna in 1960. ''It was as bad as I want to go through,'' said Bob Wells, who owns a local real estate agency. It was unnerving, Mr. Wells said, ''being stuck in your house with the wind howling fiercely, trees going down and you knowing the water is rising.'' In Naples, 55 miles north of Everglades City, the storm did not do a great deal of damage to buildings, although uprooted trees were in a jumble throughout the city, and repair costs were expected to run into the tens of millions of dollars. A few blocks away, Kathleen Cantera said she was preparing to evacuate her children and her jewelry to Orlando, where she hoped they would find electricity. Her gold-colored stucco house with wrought-iron gates was dry for now, but the street out front was becoming more flooded. ''It was the worst I've ever been through,'' Ms. Cantera said. On Marco Island, south of Naples, officials estimated that 30 percent of the homes had roof damage. In Fort Myers Beach, farther north on the Gulf Coast, Mayor Bill Van Duzer said he was mostly pleased with the way his area had weathered the hurricane. ''There's a certain amount of damage,'' he said, ''but the sewers are operational, the water's operational, the roads are clear.'' Mr. Paulison of FEMA said many mobile homes were destroyed in rural Glades County, which borders Lake Okeechobee, in the middle of South Florida. Carl Fowler, a spokesman for the Broward County Emergency Operations Center, said the damage there, on the Atlantic Coast, was the worst from a hurricane since the 1950's. Mobile homes were particularly hard hit, and two tall buildings housing the county courthouse and school board saw many of their plate-glass windows shattered. In Miami-Dade County, where about one million customers lost power, downed trees and wires made driving impossible. A main thoroughfare in downtown Miami flooded, and windows were blown out of high-rises. Miami International Airport haddamage to its gates and had only one runway open for emergencies. In North Bay Village, north of Miami Beach, several sailboats that had not been tied down were thrown onto small islands, as were satellite television antennas and tree limbs. Lampposts, pieces of wood and bits of power transformers floated in Biscayne Bay. At the Gator Racquet Club, a community of houseboats, 10 of the 36 boats were lost. Bill Bates, who lost the two-story boat he had lived on for nine years, tried to find a bright side. ''There is a sense of freedom that comes with this,'' Mr. Bates said. ''We are not tied down here for any reason now.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW Correction: October 31, 2005, Monday A front-page article on Tuesday about Hurricane Wilma's path through Florida misstated the distance between Everglades City and Naples, cities hit by the storm. It is about 35 miles, not 55."
"Highways out of this shattered resort city were jammed on Monday with cars, buses and trucks as residents and tourists tried to flee a city beset by looters, rumors of vandals and a scarcity of food and water. A day after Hurricane Wilma left, residents of the city's poorer sections said that bands of young men wielding machetes were breaking into homes, spraying walls with graffiti and stealing things like food and appliances. Aleli Torres was hitchhiking with her two children, her sister and her niece on the main highway south of town. Her husband, Jose Rene Rosado, stayed behind to guard their house. ''They break in, and they are nothing but teenage boys,'' Ms. Torres said. ''They are threatening people with machetes.'' City officials said there were no reports of gangs breaking into houses, but the stories were strong enough to prompt many residents to leave town. Hurricane Wilma was blamed for six deaths in Mexico, The Associated Press reported, and President Vicente Fox announced plans to start evacuating about 30,000 frazzled tourists. On Monday morning, the skies were blue but the streets were full of signs of the toll that the storm took on residents here. There were long lines at the few gas stations left standing, and people waited more than four hours to fill their tanks. A half-dozen military trucks carrying food and water made it through the flooded highway from Mérida, 197 miles to the west. People stood in a line that stretched for nearly a mile to receive supplies from the soldiers. Thousands of tourists tried to leave for Mérida in rented vans, only to be turned around at Leona Vicario, about 30 miles outside of Cancún, where a section of road was under more than 5 feet of water. Two tractor-trailers were stuck in the water there. Some tourists ended up returning to the same hotels they left that morning. Others, in large buses hired by tour companies, made it out of town. Along the way, poor people set up roadblocks with stones and logs, trying to extract a toll from passing cars. Elsewhere in the city, people cleaned up streets, hacked apart downed trees and opened shops. Hardware stores and mechanics' shops did a brisk business. A poultry company sold chickens for $5 apiece off the backs of trucks. More military vehicles appeared in the city while the state and federal police kept up their patrols. But the officials here said that it would take several more days before power was restored, and the police were advising people to stay indoors at night. STORM AND CRISIS: MEXICO"
"The living were not the only ones uprooted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The force of the storms literally raised the dead from their resting places in peaceful parish cemeteries, sending nearly a thousand coffins and vaults floating across the Gulf Coast and creating a macabre puzzle for Louisiana coroners and morticians. Storm surges as high as 20 feet transformed two-ton concrete vaults, tombs and coffins into virtual ships that traveled for miles across parish lines, landing in front yards, fields and swamps. One barnacle-encrusted vault found underwater in a marsh is thought to have been a victim of Hurricane Audrey in 1957. A coffin showed up on the lawn of Dr. Bryan Bertucci, the coroner of St. Bernard Parish. And later, a parish resident informed Dr. Bertucci that he found the remains of his grandmother, still wearing her pink gown, out of her grave in a local cemetery. ''Coffins were torn out of mausoleums like a child's blocks,'' Dr. Louis Cataldie, the state emergency medical director, said. ''There are a lot. It is very disturbing to a lot of families who want their loved one. It is very disturbing.'' Many of the coffins lack identification, so the task of learning the identity of the remains and returning them to their cemeteries is falling on the shoulders of medical examiners and coroners around the state, already overburdened with the victims of the most recent storms. An official said 137 disinterred remains, 80 of which were in their coffins, had been taken to the same temporary morgue that the state set up for Hurricane Katrina victims, while parish coroners would handle others. Some coffins built in the 1960's and later contain burial scrolls with the names of the dead screwed into the exterior. In other cases, workers can trace the coffins using manufacturer's serial numbers and hand-drawn cemetery maps. Some family members have identified relatives through rosaries, scars, pacemakers or X-ray evidence of fractures. If embalming is intact, a visual identification can sometimes be made or DNA matching can be helpful. ''Cemeteries are very important to people in the South,'' Dr. Cataldie said. ''We take care of our dead. In those cemeteries they find their memories and their childhoods. It's important to give them their mommies, daddies and grandparents back.'' Federal officials from the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team, known as Dmort, are assisting local officials in finding and identifying the remains, using marsh buggies, airboats and helicopters. New coffins are found every day, sometimes in trees. Exposed skeletal remains have been salvaged from between cracked statues of Jesus and Mary. Like the remnants of classical antiquity, marble figures with broken wings rest on wasted cemetery lawns, lying among toppled headstones, some with inscriptions like ''Hunting in Heaven.'' Empty graves look like spaces between teeth. A mausoleum appears like a desk emptied of its drawers. ''Many are in extremely remote and inaccessible areas,'' Don Kelly, a spokesman for Dmort, said. ''They have been carried way downrange into muck and swamp and forest.'' Family members fear that relatives, buried years ago, are now hidden in unknown fields, their bodies and stories lost. ''The first place they came was their cemeteries,'' said Zeb Johnson, an investigator for the Calcasieu Parish coroner in far southwestern Louisiana and the owner of Johnson Funeral Home in Lake Charles, who receives constant phone calls. ''This may go on for years.'' A few miles away in the town of Creole, the Sacred Heart Cemetery is full of disturbed graves. ''You just can't imagine that water can be that destructive,'' said Eloucia S. Richard, 78, a retired teacher who came to the cemetery to check on the grave of her husband, Dalton J. Richard, which was intact. ''I knew everybody,'' said Ms. Richard, crying when she saw dead friends missing. ''I knew where everybody lived.'' Two missing from the mausoleum were her students, and she thought that there might be more. ''I know them very well, playing football,'' she recalled. ''Such a horrible thing. I knew these people. Where did they go?'' In St. Bernard Parish, just east of New Orleans, Merrick Cemetery is one of many devastated graveyards. Situated in a historically black section of Violet, it is full of cinderblock tombs built by neighborhood residents, who often painted them on the birthdays of the dead. Larry M. Aisola, 32, a lawyer, would like to know where his dead grandfather and mother are, as well as his grandmother, buried days before Hurricane Katrina hit. ''They've got to go back,'' Mr. Aisola said. ''The problem is trying to figure out how to put them back together.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE DEAD"
"It's like the Three Little Pigs fable, said Stefanos Polyzoides, an architect from Pasadena, Calif. If you rebuild hurricane-flattened houses out of brick, they will have a better chance of withstanding any repeat of the 30-foot surges that churned this city into what looks like a war zone today. But brick is expensive. And it does not necessarily reflect the wood-porch aesthetic that Gulf Coast residents so treasure. This and other questions of form and function -- from how many stories houses should have to how far casinos should penetrate the downtown -- were debated during a daylong tour of Biloxi by a group of architects and planners as part of a rebuilding forum this week in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The remainder of the some 200 professionals who gathered here, including regional planning and environmental teams, went off to survey other coastal areas -- Ocean Springs and Pascagoula to the east and Gulfport, Long Beach, Pass Christian and Bay St. Louis toward New Orleans and the west. Armed with box lunches, the Biloxi troupe boarded a bus in the morning. First stop: City Hall. ''We need to get housing back, businesses open, people working,'' Mayor A.J. Holloway of Biloxi said. Asked what he imagined would emerge from the forum, Mr. Holloway said: ''I hope some good ideas. Because I've got a lot of problems.'' George Lawrence, the councilman for the First Ward, asked the group to keep the waterfront needs of the shrimping industry in mind. Leland Speed, of the Mississippi Development Authority, said there was tremendous time pressure to avoid haphazard real estate development and speculation. ''We've got to do this fast, before other plans are gelled,'' he said. ''The two big things we need on the Mississippi Coast are housing and hope.'' The mayor joined the tour for the duration of the day. He led it through the downtown area, with stops at the damaged town green, where the city's Mardi Gras parade concludes; historic tourist sites like the flooded Magnolia Hotel and Mary Mahoney's Old French House restaurant, now a shell, though an ancient live oak nearby survived. Mr. Polyzoides said the downtown's proximity to the waterfront hotel strip presented a significant opportunity. The city should move away from ''vast, dead buildings'' like the federal courthouse, the architect said, and bring in a variety of retail ''to make active ground floors.'' ''Main Street needs to be ripped out and recast as a serious walkable main street,'' he added. ''There's so little left.'' Next, the group drove to Eagle Point in the Woolmarket area, north of downtown, where wealthy homes lining the Biloxi River are now mere skeletons. A couple of pleasure boats were visible, tossed high on a nearby hill. ''I venture to say everyone will build back here,'' the mayor said. The neighborhood clearly illustrates a post-hurricane puzzle: Should houses be built three stories high so water can rush through a ground floor devoted to storage and garage space? It's an unusual height for a single-family home, said Elizabeth Moule, Mr. Polyzoides's wife and business partner. It could result in ''mansionizing everything in the area,'' she said. Mr. Polyzoides, who said Woolmarket suffered from ''old-fashioned sprawl,'' speculated about creating more density as both a protective and revitalizing measure. ''I wonder what would happen if you had an Italian or French village here, with 400 homes close together,'' he said. But owners of one- to three-acre plots tend to resist living close together, he added; they want independence and privacy. For their part, developers prefer selling larger tracts at a time. The group also visited a school; Keesler Air Force Base, to the north on the bay side; Beach Boulevard, or Route 90, the coastal highway that is now an eerie strip of devastated casino hotels; and Howard Avenue, a poor area a block or two north of Beach Boulevard, where the houses now look like heartbreaking piles of pickup sticks. After a break for dinner, the Biloxi group met to confer. ''The big question is, What do we do?,'' Ms. Moule said. ''We need to establish what we're going to work on.'' Over the next two and a half hours, the participants grappled with priorities: neighborhood rezoning, downtown, museums and culture, casinos, beachfront, road system, building codes, transit development. They knew they could not do it all, but it was hard not to try. The topics addressed were literally all over the Biloxi map. David J. Hardy, of Guild Hardy Architects in Biloxi, said the emphasis should be on low-income housing: ''Howard Avenue, Howard Avenue,'' he said. Ms. Moule said the group should try to figure out how to make the Air Force base a more integrated part of the city. ''I say we treat Keesler like a campus -- we make a town-gown relationship to Keesler,'' she said. ''We need to think about a concentrated retail area where these people walk off the base and start to spend some of their dollars out in the town, and we take that economic energy. I think that's a huge opportunity.'' Walter Bolton, a Biloxi architect, countered that people who work on the base don't have that much money to spend. The talk turned to how to transform the beachfront strip into something closer to the French Riviera and whether to establish a stronger north-south artery connecting Biloxi to Interstate 10 to the north. As the planners scribbled on large maps spread out on tables, envisioning bright casinos, quaint homes, charming streets -- a vibrant and healthy city -- it was almost possible to forget the eviscerated landscape they had traveled through all day. But Mr. Polyzoides said he was still trying to adjust to what his eyes had taken in. ''I haven't seen destruction like this my entire life,'' he said. ''The nature of this devastation is completely overwhelming. It's a tremendous task to bring back neighborhoods. They need to be brought back one building at a time.''"
"As the Gulf Coast reels from two catastrophic storms in a month, and the Carolinas and Florida deal with damage and debris from hurricanes this year and last, even some supporters of coastal development are starting to ask a previously unthinkable question: is it time to consider retreat from the coast? Yes, said Howard Marlowe, president of Marlowe & Company, a lobbying firm that represents counties and local governments, often in seeking support for coastal infrastructure, like roads, sewers and beach replenishment. ''I think we need to be asking that and discussing that, and the federal government needs to provide leadership,'' Mr. Marlowe said. He added, ''I have never been an advocate for the federal government telling people that they have to move out, but it's important to have a discussion at all levels of government about what can be done to make sure more people do not put themselves in harm's way. It will not be an easy dialogue.'' The idea that much of the coast is dangerous and getting more so is not new. Coastal scientists have been saying for years that global warming will threaten coastal areas with higher seas and more powerful storms, and that a hurricane lull that began in the mid-1960's will eventually give way to the far more dangerous pattern of storms that prevailed in the 1930's, 40's and 50's. Since then, though, development has transformed the nation's shoreline, especially on the east and gulf coasts. By last year, when four hurricanes crossed the state of Florida in a matter of weeks, it was clear the lull had ended. This year, Hurricanes Katrina, Ophelia and Rita drove the hazard lesson home. A.R. Schwartz, a Democrat who for decades represented Galveston and much of the Texas coast in the State Legislature, said he now regretted some of the legislation he had pushed that subsidized development on the coast, particularly a measure that provides tax relief to insurance companies faced with wind damage claims. Mr. Schwartz, whose constituents knew him as Babe, said that measure was ''a terrible mistake -- in my mind, as opposed to my heart, because the people need the insurance -- because it has been an invitation for people to build homes on barrier islands and on peninsulas that are exposed to storms, at public expense.'' ''We are facing a crisis now because of that law I passed,'' said Mr. Schwartz, who now lives in Austin where he works as a lobbyist and lawyer. Daniel P. Schrag, director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, said that as coastal areas, and islands, recover ''there has to be a discussion of what responsibility we have not to encourage people to rebuild their houses in the same way.'' Even the fate of New Orleans should be open to discussion, Dr. Schrag said. ''Spending hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild a city that puts it in harm's way once again and relying on technology such as higher dikes and levees seems to me a very dangerous strategy,'' the more so in an era of global warming. Erosion already threatens 70 percent of the nation's coastline, and is especially severe on the east and gulf coasts. In a report to Congress in 2000, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said that more than a quarter of the houses within 500 feet of the coast might be lost to the sea by 2060. The report said these losses would put an intolerable burden on the federal government, which insures many of the structures through its flood insurance program. ''We are getting these lifetime storms every couple of years,'' said Riley G. Hoggard, a resource management specialist at the Gulf Islands National Seashore, where the road to Fort Pickens, on Santa Rosa Island here, has been washed out and rebuilt three times in the last year. ''Maybe we need to get into a program of orderly retreat.'' In recent decades, people have been doing just the opposite. According to the Census Bureau, 87 million people, nearly a third of the nation's population, live on or near the Atlantic or gulf coasts. Harry Simmons, president of the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, which advocates for beach replenishment and other infrastructure support for coastal communities, said that 3,600 Americans moved to the coast every day. ''You cannot draw up a worse case scenario for increased property damage, risk to human life and cost to taxpayers,'' said Robert S. Young of Western Carolina University, who studies coastal development. Just as a commission was formed to identify military bases for closing, he said, a commission should be formed to identify ''those sections of shoreline that are clearly so vulnerable to storm damage that they should no longer receive any federal subsidy of infrastructure rebuilding, they should be yanked out of the flood insurance program, those sorts of things.'' Mr. Young said the commission should be made up of representatives from FEMA, the United States Geological Survey, the Army Corps of Engineers and university researchers. ''It could not have politicians on it because coastal politicians, even if they are fiscal conservatives, would want to defend their coastal turf,'' he said. He said he would propose the idea this month, when he has been asked to testify before a subcommittee of the House Resources Committee. ''We need to just make a start,'' he said. Meanwhile, scientists from the geological survey have been making detailed observations of the coastal landscape, before and after storms, to try to identify characteristics, not always obvious, that make areas more or less vulnerable to storm damage. The geological survey is not in the business of defining where people should or should not live, said Abby Sallenger, a scientist with the agency who has been leading data collection efforts on the gulf coast. But, he said, ''There are sections of the east and gulf coasts that are extremely hazardous and the scientific community could come to agreement on where they are'' so that policy makers could act on the information. Like others who study this issue, he said two good candidates for retreat were Dauphin Island in Alabama, much of it wiped out by Hurricane Katrina, and North Topsail Island, N.C., which, he said, ''gets wiped out routinely.'' But plenty of people reject the idea that those who live on the coast are any more at risk than those who live in areas prone to tornadoes, earthquakes or forest fires, even in an era of increased storms. ''There are engineering solutions to almost any problem we face,'' said Mr. Simmons of the beach association, who is mayor of Caswell Beach, N.C., near Cape Fear. He said the problem with places like North Topsail Island is too little infrastructure support, not too much. ''We are not doing a good enough job maintaining things'' like beaches, he said. In the past, the promise of engineering has prevailed against efforts to get the federal government out of the coastal development business. More than a decade ago, for example, FEMA scientists suggested imposing new limits on federally subsidized flood insurance and government support for roads, sewers and other infrastructure in erosion hazard areas. But advocates for development denounced the move as undue federal interference, and it was defeated. Setback requirements have been successfully challenged as unconstitutionally limiting people's use of their property. But Mr. Marlowe, the lobbying firm president, said: ''What I am looking for is a national commitment to a plan that says: 'O.K., we have people in these areas, how are we going to protect them? We have other people in these areas wherewe are going to discourage future development because we cannot protect things that are there.''' Mr. Simmons said this kind of planning would be a good thing. But he said the beach preservation association ''has always taken the position that sound development is the way to go,'' with zoning and building codes determined locally. ''What I hear some people saying is you should just bulldoze the place and leave it to the birds and the turtles, and I don't agree with that,'' he said. Mr. Hoggard of the Park Service said he would not consign even Fort Pickens to that fate. But, he said, it is time to consider replacing the road, possibly, for example, with a ferry service from the mainland. But, as is the case on all the developed shoreline, abandoning infrastructure means lost revenue, in this case fees from a year-round campground. So Mr. Hoggard said there would be pressure to maintain the road, flooded yet again by pounding surf churned up by Hurricane Rita. ''We can do that with our technology,'' he said. ''But only for so long, and at a great price.''"
"The Energy Department on Monday announced a campaign to persuade Americans to use less energy, a response to record prices for natural gas and heating oil as cooler weather arrives. The strategy follows President Bush's comments last week urging Americans to cut back on nonessential car trips and ordering the federal government to conserve energy. It is a shift by the Bush administration, which had been emphasizing increasing energy supplies. On Monday, the energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, said that new supplies were still essential but that they were a long-term solution. To react to the damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Mr. Bodman said, only conservation will offer any immediate help. The announcement included a mascot for the campaign, Energy Hog, which the department planned to use like Smokey Bear or McGruff the Crime Dog. Agency employees also handed out booklets with conservation tips, which the administration hopes that utilities and companies that sell energy products will reprint and distribute, and temporary tattoos for children, showing the hog and the Web address, www.energyhog.org, with games and activities. A site for grown-ups, www.energysavers.com, will promote energy-efficient appliances, insulation, better windows and other improvements. Mr. Bodman said that the department, in cooperation with a private group, the Alliance to Save Energy, would begin distributing public service announcements to radio stations and newspapers, and that specialists at the Energy Department would offer to visit factories to advise owners on how to cut fuel use. But most of the focus was on consumers. ''Individual action from every American can add up to a tremendous collective effort and can produce significant results,'' Mr. Bodman said. With natural gas prices about double the level of last winter, specialists say that cuts in demand could moderate prices. Mr. Bodman would not set any goals for the amount of energy to be saved. Kateri Callahan, the president of the Alliance to Save Energy, standing beside him, said that America wasted half its fuel, so that was the potential. Congress is also considering a budget that would eliminate the Energy Department's regional offices, where many of the employees who promote conservation are based. The Senate version of the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for the fiscal year that began on Saturday called for phasing out six offices. A spokeswoman, Anne Womack Kolton, said work could be shifted to other offices with less overhead if the offices were closed. Mr. Bodman said that some of the offices had been closed but that there were no plans to close more of them. In response to questions, Mr. Bodman would not say whether the administration would favor more assistance to low-income families to pay their winter heating bills, or new rules to require high-mileage cars and trucks. He would not say if the administration would release heating oil from the emergency reserve, but pointed out that the administration had offered some crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He said that the situation was not like the one in 1979-80, when President Jimmy Carter put on a sweater and appealed on television for the public to conserve; this time, Mr. Bodman said, it was damage to energy infrastructure, implying that a restoration to pre-Hurricane Katrina production levels was foreseeable."
"To a 17-year-old, the smallest upset can seem a disaster. But Keydra Thomas has learned better since Hurricane Katrina sent her 1,300 miles from her home on Abundance Street in New Orleans. ''It's a test, in a way,'' Keydra said as she waited for her class photo to be taken at Immaculate Conception High School here. ''You do learn new things. Like not having nice shoes or a new dress for a party, that's not a disaster. I am alive. Some people didn't get out.'' The storm blew away all the senior plans of a cheerleader who knew everybody at McDonogh 35 Senior High, one of Louisiana's top prep schools. Keydra was to represent her class at homecoming, and she had just bought a class ring. ''It's in the store,'' she said, ''but I didn't have a chance to pick it up.'' Suddenly, she and her family had to seek refuge in Texas with only a night's worth of clothes as the hurricane thundered in. ''Last year we had to leave for Hurricane Ivan,'' Keydra recalled. ''We evacuated Wednesday morning and came back Thursday night. So we knew we'd be back soon.'' ''Then we heard that one of my uncles spent two nights on his roof,'' she continued, ''and then two days floating on a raft he built of a door and an air mattress. That's when it hit me.'' Soon the family was off to Aunt Charlotte's in Montclair. Now, encamped in a state she finds new but not novel (''New Jersey is boring,'' she said), Keydra finds solace in study. Immaculate Conception provided a free uniform. Tuition will be whatever the family can pay. Keydra has started reading ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' the first assignment for her English class. She burst into a big smile thinking of it. ''It's good,'' she said. ''Each chapter, it's always something different. You never know what's going to happen next.'' Sounds like her recent life. Keydra has studied that, too, and come away with two big lessons: ''The little things don't matter, compared to not having anything.'' And, ''You learn that it gets easier; it gets better.'' FORD BURKHART STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"Formosan termites, aggressive invaders that chew through concrete, electrical cables and houses, may be Hurricane Katrina's final threat. Termite experts are concerned that the demand for landfill space -- an estimated 50 million cubic yards in New Orleans alone -- will lead to disposal of infested debris in landfills in termite-free areas. The termites, which have much larger colonies and cover more territory than native species, were found in every neighborhood in New Orleans. They cause about $300 million in damage and control costs there each year. ''Many homes with Formosan termites in their walls were flooded for days, and they will have to be bulldozed,'' said Alan Lax, who leads the termite research unit at an Agricultural Research Service center in New Orleans. ''Termites love moisture, so they are in ideal conditions now.'' Originally from East Asia, they arrived in New Orleans and other coastal cities from troop carriers after World War II. They moved inland in railroad ties and landfill debris. In 1998, Congress approved an operation to halt the spread, which has reached 10 states. Most states have small populations of termites, but New Orleans is considered the insect's ground zero. Mississippi officials are more concerned about importing the termite from New Orleans than of its spreading from their own flood debris. Although Louisiana has a quarantine to contain the termite, the state environmental agency recently called all its landfills to check on their future capacity, even sites in termite-free parishes. Several managers from those landfills said they planned to accept debris from New Orleans. ''The contractors are responsible for taking the debris to landfills within the state laws,'' said James Pogue, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, which has contracted with private firms for debris removal. Mr. Lax said: ''We are trying to prevent infestation of areas that are not known to be infected. But there's no final plan yet.'' HANNAH FAIRFIELD"
"It's never too soon to replay the blame game. ''In His Own Words: Brian Williams on Hurricane Katrina'' on the Sundance Channel serves as a study aid for those who wish to re-examine the government's neglect of the poorest victims of that terrible storm. News programs may have moved on to the damage wrought by Hurricane Wilma, but the devastation along the Gulf Coast was a seminal moment in President Bush's faltering second term. It was also a turning point for NBC's Mr. Williams, who distinguished himself by remaining inside the infamous New Orleans Superdome throughout the hurricane and then sticking around to document the unnatural disaster that followed. The images are familiar, but still shocking, and the day-by-day reconstruction provides a damning timeline of a national disgrace. But over all, this 30-minute documentary looks like an entry for a Peabody Award -- a video victory lap produced by NBC News and, in a deft use of corporate synergy, shown on Sundance, which is partly owned by NBC Universal. NBC's evening news has stayed in first place since Mr. Williams replaced Tom Brokaw last year, partly because the new guy has faced almost no competition. Peter Jennings's death this summer left ABC without an obvious successor. CBS is still lurching in the aftermath of Hurricane Rather -- yesterday, it announced that Andrew Heyward, the longtime president of CBS News, would leave at the end of the year. The network has yet to settle on a successor to Dan Rather, relying on an emeritus newsman, Bob Schieffer, to anchor the ''CBS Evening News.'' Mr. Williams has acquitted himself well, but the odds were in his favor. On ''In His Own Words,'' Mr. Williams reminisces while perched on a backstage stool in his shirt sleeves, his tie loosened, looking a little like Joey Bishop in the days of cabaret. This normally suave anchorman talks a lot about his own feelings. ''I can't get the faces out of my mind,'' he says, referring to victims he bonded with during their long wait for rescue. ''But I shouldn't. They are part of who I am.'' It's easy to sneer at the self-referential tone and show-biz touches, but the truth is, the hurricane did deeply affect the reporters who covered it. And Mr. Williams, whose previous experience in the field was broad but thin, burrowed deeper into that story than anchors usually do, under conditions most anchors manage to skirt. He impressed viewers both by providing calm, authoritative on-the-scene reports, and also by occasionally venting his own fury at the authorities' missteps. ''I carried a case of Vienna sausage, cans of Vienna sausage, as collateral in case we had a smash-and-grab car jack, I was going to offer it to someone in exchange for my life,'' he says on the Sundance documentary, describing the lawlessness that ruled in the French Quarter after the storm. ''The government couldn't tell us that things were O.K. We were there standing next to the things that were not O.K.'' Even by today's standards, Mr. Williams's is a startlingly personal, touchy-feely report. It stands out all the more sharply next to the NBC News special report on ''Dateline'' on Friday, ''Tom Brokaw Reports: In God We Trust.'' Mr. Williams's predecessor travels to the New Life Church in Colorado to examine the influence of the evangelical movement on society and politics. Mr. Brokaw takes a more conventionally neutral approach, interviewing churchgoing families and leaders like Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, on issues like abortion, gay marriage and nominees to the Supreme Court. There is nothing neutral or self-effacing about Mr. Williams's account. People often criticize the ever-growing cult of personalities in network news, forgetting that even back in the supposedly hallowed days of Edward R. Murrow, stories were as much about the newsman as the news event. It's a symbiotic relationship: by being there, the on-air correspondent brings attention to a crisis and also siphons some of it off. Public television still manages to keep its anchors off camera -- PBS's ''Frontline,'' for example, often has its reporters provide an audio narration and allows the pictures to speak for themselves. Commercial television has a different mandate. Celebrity sells, and always did. In an effort to nail down Mr. Williams's lead in the ratings, NBC has merely speeded up the process. The Katrina documentary carries two messages: ''Look at this,'' and ''Look at me looking at this.'' It's the nature of network television news, and it's not such a terrible trade-off.

"It was an already-too-familiar scene: a gas station here with a line of people holding fuel cans wrapped around the block, a line of cars stretching at least a mile and half a dozen police officers trying to keep the peace. ''If I don't get gas here today, I'll be sleeping here on this sidewalk,'' said Felicia Martin of Miami Shores, who had waited an hour in downtown Miami with one small can in hopes of reaching an open grocery store. ''My car is on E.'' Ms. Martin and other South Floridians experienced a second day of extraordinary lines for supplies that ran out faster than expected or did not arrive at all in the wake of Hurricane Wilma. It was not that the loss of life and property was drastic in a state that has become accustomed to punishing hurricanes, with at least 10 people dead. But the extent of the power disruptions, affecting 2.6 million homes and businesses, left frustrated residents and government officials trying to cope with a shortage of basic necessities like hot food, water and gasoline. After government distribution centers for ice and water here opened belatedly on Tuesday, some ran out of stock by Wednesday morning, and local officials said they had no idea when new shipments would come. Getting gasoline was an even bigger challenge in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, a region of five million people, because only a few stations were open on generator power. Many grocery stores had reopened, but lines there were often enormous, too. And the full restoration of power was expected to take weeks. Gov. Jeb Bush said he was disappointed and took responsibility for the problems with government-issued supplies, but said he had ''raised the bar probably, maybe, too high'' by leaving expectations that ice and water would be distributed a day after the storm. He emphasized that residents had had days to prepare as the storm stalled over Mexico and should have bought enough supplies for the first 72 hours. ''Frankly, this conversation wouldn't be taking place in any other part of the country,'' Mr. Bush told reporters in Tallahassee as R. David Paulison, the acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, stood by. ''This is because we do have high expectations here.'' Craig Fugate, the state's director of emergency operations, said he had not anticipated such high demand for supplies on the southeast coast because storms usually faded as they crossed land. Hurricane Wilma weakened slightly after entering the state around Naples on the gulf coast but still packed winds of more than 100 miles an hour by the time it reached Fort Lauderdale and Miami. ''For the life of me, I always thought a hurricane hit on one coast and weakened when it got to the other coast,'' he said. ''This one didn't.'' If urban areas were suffering because of their large populations, rural regions, which in some cases were harder hit, appeared all but forgotten. In Hendry County, one of the state's poorest, emptiest and most remote, storm victims needed food and tarpaulins, and officials could not say when they would arrive. ''We've got a lot of hungry people here,'' said Ronnie Lee, the sheriff. The administrator of the Hendry County Sheriff's Department at the headquarters in Labelle, Capt. Susan English said, ''We're still waiting on tarps and food from FEMA.'' Hendry County, a farming area with a population of 38,000, was one of the hardest-hit regions. Hundreds of mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, and roofs were torn off some concrete-block houses, county officials said. ''The state has put a tracer on the food and tarps, several truckloads of food and 6,000 tarps,'' said Tom Kochheiser, the director of emergency operations in Hendry County. Officials in Clewiston, in Hendry County about 40 miles east of Labelle, said no food had arrived from state or federal authorities. But they said there was no crisis. They said that some water and ice arrived late Tuesday afternoon and that more came in Wednesday. Workers from the Alabama Baptist State Convention served a snack of tacos and peanut butter and jelly to 5,000 people at noon Tuesday, Brackett Crocker, a field manager for the group, said. Late in the afternoon, hundreds of cars lined up for a ladle of beef stew and sliced peaches. The stew lasted for about an hour, and then the church workers began giving out cookies, tuna snacks and cartons of chicken cacciatore. Francisco Leon, a tractor driver, sat in line in his pickup with his wife, Kim. ''We run out of food,'' Mr. Leon said. ''We got two hungry kids at the house.'' Mali Chamness, a Republican who has been mayor of Clewiston for four years, said that she had spoken with many people and that nobody had told her they were hungry. Ms. Chamness said she had spoken with Governor Bush about an hour after Hurricane Wilma passed. Shortly before she spoke with him, she said, state and federal search and rescue teams reached Clewiston. ''We are a small city, but we know our voice has been heard,'' Ms. Chamness said. In Miami-Dade County, at least one of the 11 ice and water distribution sites had run out of supplies less than 24 hours after opening. Another was still waiting for its initial shipment. Local officials did not directly blame FEMA or the state but made clear they were angry. ''We do not know, and FEMA cannot tell us, when they will be resupplied,'' said Mayor Carlos Alvarez of Miami-Dade County. ''Once we run out of whatever we have, I can tell you that we don't have any more until further notice.'' Governor Bush and Mr. Paulison of FEMA vowed to improve the process, and as the day wore on distribution appeared to go more smoothly even as the lines stayed long. At the Oakwood Plaza shopping center in Hollywood, two dozen police officers and 18 National Guardsmen kept order as a crowd waited for eight trucks carrying food, water and ice from Palm Beach County. Two truckloads of supplies that had arrived earlier in the day were depleted by early afternoon. The new shipment arrived about 1:40 p.m., and by 2:20 the first car of a milelong line was allowed into the parking lot. Each vehicle received 40 pounds of ice, four gallons of water, cans of stew, peanut butter, jelly, chips, crackers and dried fruit. Most of the more than three million homes and businesses that lost power during the storm were still without it on Wednesday, though the state said service had been restored to about 900,000 of them by 4 p.m. Geisha Williams, a vice president of Florida Power and Light, the largest provider, said most of its customers would probably have power again within two weeks. Some, however, might have to wait almost until Thanksgiving, she said. ''What makes it challenging and long is the incredible volume we have to deal with,'' Ms. Williams said, adding that the damage was the most the power grid had sustained since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Governor Bush said that while power disruptions were inconvenient, Floridians were not facing nearly as severe a situation as were residents of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, where the storm caused extensive flooding. That, he said, ''puts it in perspective for me, at least.''"
"ConocoPhillips said yesterday that third-quarter profit almost doubled after hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico curbed supplies and sent oil and natural gas prices to record highs. The company, based in Houston, said it suffered disruptions from the hurricanes, particularly Katrina and Rita, which were more than offset by higher energy prices. Oil companies are benefiting from a surge in profits as demand shows no signs of slowing despite a doubling of crude prices in less than two years. Natural gas prices have also doubled since the start of the summer. Producers are facing criticism that they did not invest enough in refining capacity or new production projects to increase supplies. In response to concerns about gasoline price gouging and accusations of profiteering by consumer groups, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, introduced legislation last month to impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies. More recently, the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, called on Exxon Mobil, BP and Chevron to increase their investments in refining and support a pipeline that would bring natural gas from Alaska. At ConocoPhillips, the first major American company to report earnings for the third quarter, net income was $3.8 billion, or $2.68 a share, compared with $2 billion, or $1.43 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 43 percent, to $49.7 billion from $34.7 billion. BP, which is based in London, said Tuesday that its third-quarter profit rose 16 percent, to $4.41 billion. Exxon Mobil and Chevron publish their results today and tomorrow. Shares of ConocoPhillips, which is based in Houston, gained 36 cents, to $62.80 yesterday, as the company beat Wall Street expectations, in part because of the contribution by its stake in a Russian oil company, Lukoil. ConocoPhillips produced 1.79 million barrels of oil and gas a day on average over the quarter, including 270,000 barrels a day from its investment in Lukoil. It doubled the stake it owns in that company to 14.8 percent after investing $2 billion to buy the Russian government's share last year. Under the agreement, ConocoPhillips can raise its stake to 20 percent."
"Inflation rose to its highest monthly rate in more than 25 years in September, the government reported yesterday, but excluding a surge in energy costs, prices were restrained through most of the economy. The consumer price index, which has been rising steadily through much of the year, jumped 1.2 percent last month, the fastest monthly pace since March 1980, the Labor Department reported. Still, the core inflation rate, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose just 0.1 percent, a rate that has stayed steady for the last four months. The inflation figures, the first reflecting the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, were perhaps the most closely followed of the economic data released yesterday. Other reports showed that retail sales rose at a moderate pace after sliding in August, consumer confidence dropped for the third consecutive month, and industrial production declined as the two hurricanes and a strike at Boeing idled assembly lines, oil rigs, chemical plants and refineries. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased by 0.2 percent in September, slower than the 0.5 percent gain economists had expected. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 1.1 percent. In August, retail sales fell 2.1 percent as Detroit's big three automakers wound down big discounts. Last month's data were also skewed by a sharp increase in the dollar value of gasoline purchases (up 4 percent from August) as prices at the pump soared past $3 a gallon. Excluding both cars and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.6 percent. But Americans are not very optimistic. The University of Michigan survey of consumer confidence fell to 75.4 this month, its lowest reading in 15 years, with respondents expressing pessimism about both current and future economic conditions. Energy costs jumped 12 percent last month and the prospect of sharply higher heating bills are a huge concern for many Americans, economists said. Nationally, the average retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was $2.816 yesterday, up from $1.989 a year ago, according to AAA, the auto club. The government estimates heating bills will rise by 30 percent to 48 percent this winter. ''We are going to have a winter of discontent,'' said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research, noting that consumer spending in the coming holiday season will be depressed as a result. The average weekly earnings of about 80 percent of the nation's labor force -- people in manufacturing or nonsupervisory jobs -- fell 1.2 percent from August to September when adjusted for inflation, according to the Labor Department. The real wages of these Americans have fallen in all but 4 of the last 12 months. The Social Security Administration said yesterday it would raise income benefits for 52 million Americans by 4.1 percent beginning in January to account for inflation. The consumer price index was up 4.7 percent from September 2004; excluding food and energy, it was up 2 percent. At the nation's industrial facilities, production fell 1.3 percent last month, the Federal Reserve reported, mostly because the hurricanes disrupted production and critical raw material supplies. Production in mining, which includes oil and natural gas production, for instance, fell 9.1 percent. The Fed estimates that the hurricanes reduced production by 1.7 percentage points. These and other blows to the economy from the hurricane appear temporary and limited. On consumer prices, for instance, economists note inflation remains incredibly tame, aside from energy. Transportation seems to be the only industry that has passed on higher energy costs to customers; prices in the sector rose by 5.4 percent last month, after a 2.4 percent jump in August. In other sectors, prices have been kept in check by cheap imports from places like China and India, said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. ''Energy is being driven by a unique set of forces -- supply and demand -- that are not bearing down on other goods and services,'' he said. The Federal Reserve is also determined not to let higher energy prices drive prices of other goods and services higher by raising the short-term interest rate, now at 3.75 percent. The Fed is expected to raise the rate again on Nov. 1 and Dec. 13. In addition to lowering demand and making loans more expensive, a rising interest rate serves a psychological purpose, Mr. Roach said. Inflation feeds on fear: if consumers believe prices are going to be higher next week, they will buy more this week, which will assure that prices will indeed be higher. That is a lesson the Fed learned during the 1970's energy crisis when annual inflation rates soared past 10 percent. ''By staying disciplined with regard to inflationary policy, the Fed nips any inflationary expectations in the bud,'' Mr. Roach said."
"The nation's economy displayed resilience in September despite two devastating hurricanes and surging energy costs, economic reports released yesterday show. New-home construction picked up speed in September and permits for new building jumped, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, indicating that rising interest rates and concerns about inflation have not yet slowed the new housing market. A separate report said mortgage applications for home purchases rose last week. And a Federal Reserve survey of the national economy, known as the beige book, said that most of the country was experiencing ''moderate or gradual'' economic growth because of improved hiring, higher wages and increased growth in several industries. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 128.87 points, or 1.25 percent, to 10,414.13 yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.71 percent. The stock market, which surged late in the day, was responding not only to the economic data but also to quarterly profit reports from J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Yahoo, among others. In addition, the markets reacted to a report showing rising inventories of oil and gasoline. ''When you look through the vast majority of reports -- even the ones that are bad -- what you see is the undertow is still pretty strong,'' said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. Joshua Shapiro, chief United Sates economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an investment firm in New York, agreed with that assessment. ''Basically, what they are saying is the underlying health of the economy was very good pre-hurricane and pre-spike in energy prices,'' he said. ''And it is still pretty good after those things.'' Housing starts, which measure the beginning of new construction, increased 3.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 2.1 million, after dipping in July and August, the Commerce Department reported. New housing permits rose 2.4 percent, to an annual pace of 2.1 million. The Fed's survey reported robust hiring in financial, professional and technical services and even cited labor shortages in industries like trucking. But it also noted concerns about rising energy prices, particularly higher home heating bills expected this winter, and the potential for weaker consumer spending and broader inflation. ''Clearly, retailers are very nervous,'' Mr. Shapiro said, noting the early Christmas promotions. Analysts and investors have been closely monitoring the housing sector to gauge the effects of higher interest rates. Some reports have shown that housing prices in some cities have fallen in recent months and that homes are staying on the market longer. Economists had expected housing starts to fall to an annual rate of 1.97 million and building permits to dip to a pace of 2.08 million. The latest data confirmed some economists' belief that home sales and prices are likely to remain at a fairly high level, without seeing the explosive growth rates of recent years or the sharp drop that some analysts have predicted. ''The market is strong,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics, a research firm based in Pepper Pike, Ohio. But, he added, ''I think we are in the final throes of these superstrong housing start numbers.'' The increased construction activity was not spread evenly across the country: housing starts were up 6.9 percent in the South and 1.9 percent in the Midwest, but unchanged in the West and Northeast, where the boom has been strongest until recently. Permits rose the most in the West, Northeast and Midwest, and fell in the South. The Fed's beige book also said it was difficult to get a clear national picture on housing. Federal Reserve branches in Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco said activity was expanding or staying strong. But Boston and New York reported homes were not selling as fast. The Atlanta branch, which covers the Gulf Coast, said demand was strong in areas that have drawn evacuees from the hurricane-damaged areas. Home-building activity on the Gulf Coast is expected to pick up later this year and early next year. The areas affected by the storm make up just a small portion of the Southern economic region, 2.4 percent, according to the Commerce Department. Another report yesterday, from the Mortgage Bankers Association, said loan applications for home purchases were up 7.3 percent last week. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.03 percent last week, about a quarter-point higher than at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac. Rates on five- and one-year adjustable rate mortgages have increased by half a point. Exceptionally low mortgage rates, combined with the rapid growth in interest-only and adjustable-rate loans, have allowed more Americans to buy homes in recent years. They have also been blamed by some analysts for helping to feed regional housing bubbles. ''We have some indications that housing markets are cooling off, although the signs are scattered and mostly anecdotal,'' Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, said in a speech in Pittsburgh yesterday. ''A substantial slowing in the pace of house-price appreciation seems inevitable as prices reach high levels relative to interest rates, rents and incomes.'' Citing the strength in the economy and rising prices, Mr. Kohn also suggested that the Fed would continue to raise interest rates. The Fed has raised the short-term fed funds rate that determines overnight borrowing costs between banks 11 times since June 2004. It now stands at 3.75 percent. The beige book, which policy makers will consult when they meet next on Nov. 1, noted strength in the labor market, construction industry, manufacturing activity and lending."
"Hurricane Wilma quickly gained strength yesterday as it spun through the Caribbean, by one measure becoming the most intense Atlantic storm ever observed. By 5 a.m. yesterday, the storm had grown into a Category 5 hurricane, with top sustained winds of 175 miles per hour, up from 80 m.p.h. on Tuesday evening. By yesterday evening, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that the winds had slowed slightly, to 160 m.p.h. Computers models predict that the storm will continue moving northwest today, possibly striking the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, before it bounces off a cold mass of air descending from the north and makes a sharp right turn to the northeast. Under the projected path, it will strike the west coast of southern Florida on Saturday night or Sunday morning and continue to the northeast, passing over Palm Beach. But the forecast still contains much uncertainty. If the storm makes an earlier, sharper turn, it may miss Florida entirely and strike Cuba instead. If it turns more slowly, it may make landfall at Tampa or farther north. The bounce off the cold front should disrupt the storm's wind patterns, and when it strikes land it is likely to be weaker, though still dangerous, at Category 2 or 3, said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the hurricane center. Still, Mr. Stewart said he and his colleagues were struck by the speed with which the storm had gained strength. ''We were anticipating it becoming a major hurricane within 24 hours,"" he said. ''It just did it in half that time or maybe a little less.'' The winds are driven by low air pressure at the eye of the hurricane. Air pressure at sea level is usually 14.7 pounds per square inch; a reconnaissance aircraft found the air at Hurricane Wilma's eye yesterday morning to be just 12.8 pounds per square inch, the lowest pressure ever measured in an Atlantic hurricane. The previous low was Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, at 12.9 pounds per square inch. Mr. Stewart said Hurricane Wilma had quickly strengthened because of warm waters and the absence of wind shear in the upper atmosphere that can pull storms apart. ''It was straight up and down, and it began to spin faster and faster and faster,'' he said. In South Florida, Monroe County officials declared a state of emergency yesterday morning and ordered tourists to leave the Keys. A mandatory evacuation order is expected for all Keys residents at noon today, if the hurricane continues on its projected path. Officials plan to open a shelter for them in Miami today. Schools and all county offices in the Keys will be closed today and Friday. Jon Myatt, a spokesman for the Florida National Guard, said Gov. Jeb Bush was expected to sign an order this morning mobilizing 1,200 soldiers to help with hurricane relief if the storm strikes Florida. The troops will then report to local National Guard armories. ''We're all ready,'' Mr. Myatt said. ''We're going to bring soldiers in. We've got enough time to make it happen.'' Florida mobilized the same number of troops before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, he said. Lt. Cmdr. Sean Kelly, a spokesman for the United States Northern Command in Colorado Springs, which is in charge of the military's response to threats on American soil, said a dozen people had been sent to Tallahassee to coordinate possible requests for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Homestead Air Reserve Base, near Miami, has been designated as a staging area for FEMA to stock food, water and ice, he said. Wilma was the 21st tropical storm to form in the Atlantic this year, exhausting this year's list of names, and any additional storms this year would be named after Greek letters, starting with Alpha. The 21 storms tie the 1933 record for the busiest season since hurricane counting started in 1851. The hurricane season, however, continues for another six weeks, ending Nov. 30. While Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the United States with devastating force, by other measures this season does not rank as the worst. An index that tracks the total energy of the storms -- taking into account how long the storms last -- finds that this year the total energy is about twice the average. But in 1950, the index, called the accumulated cyclone energy, was 2.7 times the average. ''We're not even close to unprecedented at this time,'' said Christopher Landsea, a scientist at a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration outside Miami. Several of the storms this year lasted for only a day or two. ''This year, we haven't seen the really long-lived tracks,'' he said."
"Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told House investigators on Wednesday that after a ''crash course'' in disaster, he was prepared to rebuild the Federal Emergency Management Agency so that it would never again prove so inadequate in its response to catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina. FEMA, the primary federal agency responsible for disaster response, is stuck in the 20th century when it comes to assembling and distributing emergency supplies like food and water, Mr. Chertoff said. The agency must have a better working relationship with the military, so the federal government can more quickly deploy troops, and it needs more managers seasoned in handling disasters, Mr. Chertoff told the House panel. FEMA must also be more adept at rapidly gearing up to field calls from victims and to distribute financial aid efficiently. And the agency must have more reliable communications systems, so that it knows exactly what is occurring in the disaster zone, Mr. Chertoff said. Just after Hurricane Katrina hit, he noted, he could not get the FEMA director on the phone. ''There are a lot of things that didn't work well with the response,'' Mr. Chertoff told the special House committee investigating the government's handling of Hurricane Katrina. ''We need to re-engineer FEMA.'' Mr. Chertoff defended the agency's inclusion in the Department of Homeland Security, where critics say it has been marginalized as the department focuses on preparing for terrorist attacks. And his proposals did not include significantly expanding financial resources for FEMA. But Mr. Chertoff, admitting that he was at times frustrated and angry, did not deflect criticism from his department, saying the federal government's failure to respond properly to Hurricane Katrina was primarily a result of inadequate planning. ''You can't plan in a crisis environment,'' he said. ''The challenge of dealing with this kind of ultracatastrophe is one that requires a lot of work beforehand -- months beforehand. It doesn't require work 48 hours before the event. You're past planning. You've got to be executing.'' The nearly four-hour hearing had tense moments. At one point, Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, Democrat of Georgia, suggested that Mr. Chertoff perhaps should be charged with negligent homicide for his department's response to the storm. Representative Henry Bonilla, Republican of Texas, quickly criticized her comment as ''over the top'' and ''not constructive.'' Aside from that, there was little of the rancor that dominated the committee's hearing with the former FEMA director, Michael D. Brown, who was criticized by some committee members even as he blamed budget cuts at FEMA and confusion among state and local officials in Louisiana for the troubled hurricane response. At this week's hearing, several committee members asked whether Mr. Chertoff had paid sufficient attention to the hurricane, noting that he was at home on the Saturday before the storm hit and missed a conference call among disaster planners. Three days later, as New Orleans was flooding, he attended a meeting on avian bird flu in Atlanta. ''You and your department knew a massive hurricane was heading towards New Orleans, you knew that it could create a megadisaster, but you were still at home on the Saturday,'' said Representative Charlie Melancon, Democrat of Louisiana. ''One of the major problems in the response was that there's no sense of urgency, at least at the federal level.'' Mr. Chertoff said that while he was at home and in Atlanta, he was closely monitoring the federal response. ''I'm not a hurricane expert,'' he said repeatedly, adding that Mr. Brown was expected to serve as the on-the-ground commander. But as the days passed, Mr. Chertoff said, he became increasingly agitated with Mr. Brown and FEMA's response. ''I rarely lose my temper,'' said Mr. Chertoff, a former federal judge and prosecutor, recalling the hours-long effort to reach Mr. Brown on the telephone on Aug. 30, the day after the storm hit. ''But I lost my temper to some degree.'' Rebuilding FEMA, Mr. Chertoff said, will first require creating a system that will allow the agency to field requests for emergency aid and quickly deliver supplies. ''I want to build a capacity to move things around in a nimble way,'' he said. FEMA, he said, must learn from the military, as well as private companies, about how to maintain communications with advanced electronics even in disastrous conditions. To that end, the Department of Homeland Security is setting up what he called ''emergency reconnaissance teams'' that will be deployed to disaster zones and provide immediate reports to federal officials, even if the local and state governments are incapacitated. Despite all the talk of plans to fix FEMA, committee members repeatedly asked how, weeks after Hurricane Katrina, the agency was still stumbling in its response. They cited the slow pace in setting up temporary housing for evacuees and the reliance on no-bid contracts. Mr. Chertoff did not offer a time frame for his changes. But he said the goal was simple. ''We have to meet the challenge of those catastrophes,'' he said. ''It's not enough to say something's unprecedented; we have to build capabilities to deal with the unprecedented.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE FEDERAL RESPONSE"
"There used to be a hardware store here, as evidenced by the paint scrapers, copper pots and pans, random power cords and plungers that are buried in the muck and branches. There were homes, too, where bedsheets are now strung through the trees like Christmas ribbon. There is a disembodied roof, a shrimp boat smashed to bits against a live oak tree, a file cabinet wedged in black mud, its tiny, color-coded tabs intact amid the rubble. They are all that is left of Cameron and nearby Creole. These towns, which opened Friday to residents for the first time, are part of a cluster of settlements in rural Louisiana and Texas that were essentially wiped out by Hurricane Rita, the power of which is only now beginning to reveal itself a week after it struck. Because the storm spared Houston, Galveston and other Texas cities that had expected to be pummeled by its wind and force, Hurricane Rita was broadly perceived as the Chihuahua to Hurricane Katrina's bulldog and something dodged rather than survived. But looking at small towns like this one, it is clear that from Shreveport in the north to Pecan Island in the south, from Houston in the east to New Orleans in the west, Hurricane Rita was as strong as its predecessor, or stronger. It ended about 100 lives -- many while people were trying to evacuate -- made pickup sticks of homes and businesses, upended more oil rigs than Hurricane Katrina and took away electric power for hundreds of miles. ''The American people have seen so much damage they are saturated,'' said Charles Gibson, a national guardsman from South Carolina who was one of the first outsiders to arrive here. ''There may not have been much incentive for people to get down to these little towns,'' Mr. Gibson said. ''But for the people down here who are totally devastated, they feel left out and ignored, as if their story hasn't been told.'' Hurricane Rita brought indelible pain to the lives of people like the Pughs, whose 50 family members lost every home among them but one. On Friday, the first day she was allowed to come back to town, Wardella Pugh and several members of her family picked through what was left of their store, D's Hardware and Tackle, trying to recognize a piece of roof and salvage things like the little flower pot that strangely survived the winds that flattened the rest of Cameron. Cars snaked down Highway 27, with neighbors, staring in disbelief, calling to each other from the windows. ''I'm sorry, Wardella!'' yelled a neighbor from the bed of her pickup truck. Mrs. Pugh just stared back. ''You're born and raised somewhere and you want to come back,'' she said. ''But when all you see is a pile of rubble, I don't know anymore.'' Having struck weeks earlier, Hurricane Katrina appears to have given this region one gift with many dividends: fear. Seeing what that storm wrought in New Orleans and beyond, hundreds of residents fled places like Jasper, Tex., where Hurricane Rita took a fast, unexpected turn, according to local officials and evacuees who later returned. ''If Katrina hadn't happened, I think everybody would have stayed,'' said Shannon Van Gossen, who was buying a generator on Friday at the Lowe's in Lake Charles, La. His family fled to McComb, Miss., and still spent days without power. After the embarrassing communications and response failures associated with Hurricane Katrina, the local and federal government agencies appeared to have been quick and aggressive in sending aid this way, officials and residents concurred. ''I think FEMA is stretched, but the response is good at this point,'' said Todd Hunter, the police chief of Jasper, where 95 percent of the electric grid was destroyed. ''This storm did something very unpredictable by turning. It was an unprecedented deal here.'' Jasper County has proved a difficult area for relief workers and government officials to navigate. It is long and narrow and mostly rural, and Red Cross workers describe arriving in small unincorporated areas where people have been trapped in their homes behind a maze of trees. ''This is some of the most touching stuff I've seen in a long time,'' said Brian Woodward, the site supervisor for the American Red Cross in Jasper, his eyes welling. ''When a man 80 years old who hasn't eaten in four days, and you hand them a plate with corn and meat and bread and butter and that man hugs you, that's something.'' The two storms have created a diaspora, with evacuees from Hurricane Katrina finding themselves on the move again, this time with the people whose towns they had hunkered down in. ''We had tons of Katrina people here, and they all had to leave,'' Mr. Van Gossen said. In recent days, scores of families have begun to tarp their roofs, saw at the rubble in their yards, call the insurance companies and pray for a cold front. Some were wavering between rage and disbelief. ''Can I interest you in an old, used shrimp boat?'' said Leonard Aulds, who emerged from behind what was left of his 40-foot boat, now wrapped around a tree, his orange shock of hair blowing in the slight wind. The boat, next to his camper that is no more, was docked on the river a half-mile away from its current resting place in Creole. It rode a giant wave across Highway 27 and into a tree, exploding in a mass of wood and metal, its motor exposed, the bark of the live oak it hit totally stripped. ''They kept telling us on the weather station it was going to Houston, going to Houston, and we might get 15-mile-an-hour winds,'' Mr. Aulds said. ''We might get some water.'' That was the end of his shrimping business, and his town too. ''All everyone out there is worried about is Houston and New Orleans,'' he said, pulling on a cigarette. ''We're sick of it. This storm hit Cameron Parish 10 times what it hit New Orleans, and nobody even knows it.'' STORM AND CRISIS: SMALL TOWNS Correction: October 10, 2005, Monday Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 1 about destruction caused by Hurricane Rita misstated the geographical relationship of Houston and New Orleans. Houston is west of New Orleans, not east."
"Choupique Bayou, La. Good fortune can seem all but obsolete here after Hurricane Rita. From Hackberry to Holly Beach to the parish seat of Cameron on the broken coast, the story is of devastation and a future sadly uncertain. And then there are the strangely lucky Lowerys. Patrick, John, Phillip and Cathy, middle-aged now, grew up among four other siblings in Hackberry, a settlement of cattle ranches and fishing and hunting camps on a ridge of silt and salt. Their father made a living here pumping brine for a chemical company before he died years ago. ''It's a beautiful place,'' said Cathy, 55, whose married name is Munson. Before dawn on Sunday, barely 24 hours after the storm made landfall, the four arrived in their own boat. The police had not yet set up roadblocks on Highway 27 to keep evacuees from returning to the flooded bayou towns, the first outposts on the Gulf of Mexico to confront the eye wall of the storm. The Lowerys' mission was to see what might be left of home, and the good news was striking: None of the family's houses in Hackberry had flooded. All still stood. There was bad news, of course. Roofs were damaged and trees were down and parts of yards were underwater. St. Peter's, the Roman Catholic church where Ms. Munson was married, was heavily damaged, and the fate of other touchstones remained a mystery. ''I wanted to go to my daddy's grave,'' Ms. Munson said, ''but I couldn't get there.'' Yet while others in town wondered how, and if, they could rebuild their lives, the Lowerys put tarps on roofs and cleaned spoiled food from refrigerators. They made plans. ''A month,'' guessed Phillip Lowery, and he would be back for good. It was not necessarily the whim of weather that spared them. The Lowerys grew up on one of the highest parts of Hackberry, 28 feet above sea level. Part of the site, a natural salt dome, has been hollowed out and used as the West Hackberry Strategic Petroleum Reserve Storage Area, holding 219 million barrels of oil. ''It's like a giant thermos bottle,'' John Lowery said. At the end of the boat trip on Sunday afternoon, Ms. Munson stepped onto a dry stretch of highway and inhaled. The marsh breeze and the light on the water. The herons and egrets at ease in winds that no longer threatened. And she was sure the hummingbirds would return, as they always have. ''It's the flyway for the birds,'' she said. WILLIAM YARDLEY STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency is asking more than 7,600 Florida households to pay back about $30 million in aid they received after last year's hurricanes, an agency spokeswoman said. In most cases, the agency wants the money back from storm victims who eventually got insurance settlements, said the spokeswoman, Frances Marine. ''When someone gets help from FEMA they sign an agreement that says if they end up receiving funds through their insurance coverage they can't double dip,'' Ms. Marine said. ''It's a normal part of the recovery process, and it's one that people are aware of from the get-go.'' The action, reported by The Sarasota Herald-Tribune on Tuesday, will affect people throughout Florida, with households in St. Lucie and Palm Beach Counties, in southeastern Florida, owing the most. The agency is asking for $3.7 million back from St. Lucie residents, who were directly hit by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne in September 2004. It is seeking repayment of $3.4 million from Palm Beach County residents. The agency has been under attack here since another newspaper, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, reported that it gave out $31 million to Miami-Dade County residents for Hurricane Frances, which passed 100 miles to the north and barely affected Miami. Some Miami-Dade residents have been indicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining aid, and the agency has tightened its procedures. Ms. Marine said the $30 million was a tiny fraction of the $2.4 billion in aid it had distributed to victims of last year's hurricanes. She said the agency had notified everyone who owed money, and that they could pay it back incrementally. ''With the volume of assistance going out,'' she said, ''you can't expect that the process is going to be 100 percent perfect.'' The agency has collected only $5 million of the $30 million, and Ms. Marine said it could take years to recoup it all. Douglas M. Anderson, the administrator of St. Lucie County, said he had not heard that FEMA was seeking money back from county residents, perhaps because he was so busy getting the agency to finish reimbursing the county for storm expenses. It still owes the county about $24 million of a total $41 million, Mr. Anderson said. ''A lot of our residents are still struggling,'' he said, adding that many remained in government trailers or homes with damaged roofs. ''I hope that FEMA shows compassion to these folks.''"
"Suddenly, just about everyone in the relatively obscure Gulf Coast Congressional delegation has jumped to the top of the A-list on Capitol Hill. The lawmakers are swamped with invitations to meet a variety of individuals and groups, as a parade of representatives for the regional hospitals, farms, fisheries, universities, school districts and credit unions implore them for help in obtaining shares of the billions of dollars in federal aid that Congress has set aside to rebuild after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Just as quickly, lawmakers like Representative Gene Taylor, Democrat of Mississippi, are expressing amazement as doors fly open and give them newfound access to President Bush, Republican leaders of Congress and the national news media. ''It's kind of weird that it takes something like this to have such an opportunity to speak to so many people who can make a difference,'' said Mr. Taylor, whose home in Bay St. Louis was lost to Hurricane Katrina. The Congress members and senators from the region, a mix of untested newcomers, journeymen and influential veterans, have had their entire political focus shift with single-minded attention. On a given day, influential lobbyists knock at their doors, hoping to persuade them to seize on the devastation and the government's seemingly open checkbook as an opportunity to jump-start long-stalled measures. At the same time, the lawmakers are patrolling the hallways for alliances to help pursue billions of dollars in aid for their constituents, who include the homeless from New Orleans, flooded farmers and universities like Tulane. Representative Charlie Melancon, a Louisiana Democrat who is a former president of the American Sugar Cane League, is being pressed into service by sugar farmers, who, his office said, initially asked for $165million after Hurricane Katrina and now want more money after Hurricane Rita. Representative Bobby Jindal, a first-year Republican from New Orleans, is escorting Louisiana officials around Washington as they try to give testimonials about the dire financial needs. The oil industry has turned to Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, for legislation to ease requirements to build refineries. The efforts are shaping up as a significant test of the delegation's standing and abilities. As the region begins rebuilding, obtaining federal help falls largely on their shoulders, just as it did for the New York delegation after the Sept. 11 attacks. Many of the lawmakers say that the period holds enormous promise and peril and that they will ultimately be judged on their success in bringing aid to their districts. ''We have one chance to get this right,'' said Representative Charles Boustany Jr., Republican of Louisiana, who has had several bills approved in the House, including one that provides federal grants to assist displaced residents who are seeking jobs. In the case of Louisiana, members of its Congressional delegation have spent days meeting residents, local officials and business leaders to identify needs. The lawmakers have also spent time mapping out talking points and legislative strategies. They have come up with a list of needs that would cost $250billion, far exceeding some officials' initial $200billion estimate. That is money that would come on top of the more than $60billion that Congress has already approved for the recovery, officials say. The two senators, Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat, and David Vitter, a Republican, are shopping the list around on Capitol Hill, with the support of the state's House delegation. The money would pay for a wide array of projects, including $14billion to restore coastal wetlands and $20billion to repair levees. It is also meant to address some $2billion in damage in major sectors of the economy, the forestry, sugar cane, cotton, rice, dairy, citrus, turtle, alligator and seafood industries. Other items on the list include $4,000 in tuition assistance for every displaced child; emergency pay for teachers who passed up opportunities to teach outside the state, financing to rebuild about 150 elementary and secondary schools, money to help universities and colleges pay faculty members, six months' mortgage relief for homeowners whose houses were damaged or destroyed, and an extension of unemployment benefits beyond the initial 26 weeks. ''This is what we are hearing, and this is what we need,'' Ms. Landrieu said recently at a news conference on Capitol Hill. ''It is a staggering task that is before us.'' Lobbyists for a host of industries have left very little to chance, visiting members of the region's Congressional delegation to make sure that their needs are not neglected. The tourism industry's biggest trade group, the Travel Business Roundtable, asked Congress for tax breaks on meals and travel costs to the gulf to encourage tourism. The group also is asking for tax breaks on housing for Gulf Coast businesses who house workers forced out of their housing. That day, representatives of the Louisiana health-care industry arrived here to lobby the White House and Congress for at least $1.9billion to rebuild damaged hospitals. And the insurance industry is watching closely as some lawmakers from the region are talking about forcing them to cover losses that industry officials say are not their responsibility. Insurers have long maintained that homeowners' policies cover wind and rain damage, but do not cover flood damage caused by hurricanes. But recently, at least two Democratic congressmen -- Mr. Taylor of Mississippi and Mr. Melancon of Louisiana -- argued that the flooding should be classified as wind-driven, saying that gulf water was swept inland by wind. ''I think it's absurd that insurance companies would avoid paying these claims,'' Mr. Melancon said in a recent interview. How much the lawmakers will be able to accomplish is an open question. There is some concern among them about whether Washington will fully meet the pleas for help. While Mr. Bush has promised to spend what is needed to rebuild, many of the region's lawmakers say they are well aware of how quickly priorities can shift in Washington, particularly when Congress faces a mounting federal deficit and a $5billion-a-month war in Iraq. ''We have a window of opportunity right now with national attention focused on the Gulf Coast,'' Mr. Jindal said. ''we don't expect that will last forever.'' STORM AND CRISIS: CONGRESS"
"In a country that cherishes the names of the dead, reads them aloud, engraves them in stone and stitches them into quilts, it is odd that Hurricane Katrina's victims remain, more than a month later, largely anonymous. There has been no accounting of their age, sex and race, nor of how they died or where they were found. As for how they lived, it is difficult to find even a Web site paying tribute to individual victims. With 972 deaths confirmed and the search for bodies declared complete, the state has released only 61 bodies and made the names of only 32 victims public. In contrast, of the 221 dead in Mississippi, 196 have been identified, a state official said. Like any silence, the one blanketing Louisiana's dead is ripe for interpretation -- to some, including family members who wait in anguish, it is further proof of bureaucratic bungling or a lack of regard for the poor blacks who doubtless make up many of the victims. To others, it is a deliberate attempt to shield an embarrassing truth from view. State officials, still in crisis mode, say compiling and releasing data about the dead is simply not a priority. They say several factors have contributed to delays: criminal investigations that have forced them to perform more autopsies than expected; the arrival of a second hurricane, Rita, which once again displaced their staff; and the condition bodies were in after spending days or weeks in the heat or water. The New Orleans coroner, Frank Minyard, has complained that pathologists from around the country have volunteered to help but that he awaits a trailer from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to house them. But critics say that the state officials have not released bodies whose identities are obvious and that Louisiana has imposed too tough a standard on confirming the names of victims. Tattoos, driver's licenses and physical characteristics have been used in Mississippi. But they are apparently not enough for Louisiana officials, who said last week that either a fingerprint, dental or DNA match is required. About 370 of the bodies at the temporary morgue set up by FEMA have been ''presumptively'' identified but await confirmation by one of those three methods. Nor has the Department of Health and Hospitals been willing to make public information that it has collected, from the recovery locations to the autopsy results. Dr. Louis Cataldie, the state emergency medical director, has made it clear that he is bewildered by a reporter's request for precise numbers, saying at a briefing last week that there had been ''six to seven homicides'' and ''there haven't been that many'' children. Asked afterward how many more bodies might be out there, he appeared exasperated. ''There is one out there,'' he said. ''That's all that matters, isn't it?'' After that briefing, the Department of Health and Hospitals posted the names of 32 of the dead on the Internet, but by the next morning the list was gone. On the edges of the disaster zone, a much clearer picture of Hurricane Katrina's victims has emerged. In Houston, the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office lists the names of 53 evacuees who have died, most of natural causes and two by suicide. In Dallas, there are 23, including twins who died of ''extreme prematurity due to maternal exhaustion and dehydration occurring as a result of Hurricane Katrina.'' Don Morrow, the director of operations for the coroner in East Baton Rouge, said that among the evacuees who died in his parish there were 24 males and 44 females, that 36 were white, 30 black and 2 Hispanic, and that more than 60 victims were older than 50. Six were under 21; the oldest victim was 95. Those killed directly by the storm, which struck Aug. 29, remain the least known. The lack of information has robbed the death toll, released each day in a terse statement from Dr. Cataldie's office, of a human face. ''There really haven't been any stories of who they are,'' said Marian Fontana, who lost her husband in the World Trade Center and became a prominent advocate for Sept. 11 victims' families. ''I think the way people really connected to 9/11 was people's lives, and I haven't heard any of that. It reminds me of the tsunami,'' where hundreds of victims ended up in mass graves. ''It was a big giant number in a place far away.'' Families of the victims have expressed frustration that the process is not moving more quickly. Memorial services and burials have been delayed indefinitely, and families must wait to file insurance claims, execute wills and settle estates. Even the few who have been are able to bury their loved ones question what is going on. One woman, Marion K. Babin, said it took weeks to get the body of her husband, Justin Babin, though he wore a hospital bracelet and medical dog tags listing his name and condition. Officials said that Mr. Babin had to be autopsied because he was found in a hospital and that the attorney general was investigating all hospital and nursing home deaths. And some deaths unrelated to the storm have been caught up in the process. One of the 32 names released was that of Jason Curtis Zito, 30, who choked to death on a wad of tobacco on Sept. 23, his mother said. Gary T. Hargrove, the coroner of Harrison County in Mississippi, said he was ''quite surprised'' to read that Louisiana had identified so few of the dead, and speculated that the lag was because of the state's blighted body retrieval effort, which began a week after the storm. ''We started recoveries on the Monday afternoon after the storm, as soon as the winds dropped below 60 miles per hour,'' Mr. Hargrove said, adding that 65 of the county's 88 bodies have been identified and 63 have been released. But advanced decomposition does not entirely explain the discrepancy. Just as in Louisiana, Mississippi's bodies were too decomposed to be viewed by families -- but many could be identified by physical characteristics. In Jackson County, 9 of 12 identities were confirmed, mostly by scars, tattoos, prosthetics or implants, said Vicki Broadus, the coroner. Still, forensic experts who have dealt with mass casualties cautioned that every disaster presents distinct challenges. ''Every single disaster I've ever worked this comes up, like maybe they're doing too much,'' said Dr. Mary Jumbelic, the medical examiner for Onondaga County in New York, who worked on the tsunami last year, the aftermath of Sept. 11 and several plane crashes. Medical examiners have to pre-empt fears that families received the wrong remains, Dr. Jumbelic said. ''That will be the question three months from now if the standards are not adhered to.'' Dr. Charles Hirsch, the chief medical examiner of New York City, whose office handled the dead after the World Trade Center attack, said Louisiana, where parish coroners are responsible for issuing death certificates, had geographic and jurisdictional issues that did not arise with Sept. 11, where the disaster spanned only 16 acres and the bulk of the surviving family members were not dispersed throughout the 50 states. Still, Dr. Hirsch said, with most bodies intact, forensic specialists had many more identification options available than after 9/11, when many of the remains were fragmentary. ''If you can get DNA, with modern technology, you can probably make identifications in a week or two,'' Dr. Hirsch said. The health department has collected 246 DNA samples from relatives. One morgue worker has been traveling to New Orleans to salvage dental records. Dr. Cataldie has acknowledged that the process is painfully slow, but said he had to be certain of its accuracy. Among the difficulties, he said, was the fact that bodies, and sometimes even medical records found in New Orleans, must be decontaminated when they come in to the morgue. ''If I had a child in that morgue, it'd be horrible, absolutely,'' he said. ''I don't know any way to make it faster.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE DEAD"
"Larry Moore sat outside the shelter in his wheelchair, grumbling that he was not like the others inside, the sick ones. He was shot in the stomach more than a decade ago, he said, protecting a young woman as her boyfriend tried to attack her. ''You save someone's life and this is what you get -- nothing,'' said Mr. Moore, 31, a stocky former cook who is eager to talk to anyone who will listen. ''You get treated like an animal. You get nothing here.'' Before the storms bore down on New Orleans, Mr. Moore had his own apartment, his own income from disability checks, his own life. But because he is a paraplegic after the shooting, he must stay in a ''special care'' shelter in this central Louisiana town. His mother and 16-year-old brother are here, along with nurses and other medical assistance. But all Mr. Moore really wants is privacy. He wants to use the phone when he pleases, not according to the shelter's schedule of curfews. He wants his own food, not the soybean patties and chicken the shelter usually serves. He resents the rules. ''Why do I have to take off all my clothes and burn them?'' he asked. ''I'm not the one with any disease.'' He told the others about the shooting, and showed them a deep scar the size of a dime on his right forearm, from the attack. He said he was walking through a city park, smoking marijuana, when a woman asked him for a few puffs. Her boyfriend approached, threatening with a gun. Mr. Moore said he lunged in front of the woman and caught a bullet in his stomach. A few shelter residents shooed him away. A nurse told him he was making the others anxious. Mr. Moore said he did not care. ''Ain't I already suffered enough?'' he asked. ''You got all this suffering in there. There's people in there with lice. I'm going to have lice crawling under my skin.'' He thought he had found a federally subsidized apartment in Shreveport. Then a social worker brought back his application with a box marked ''rejected.'' It indicated that Mr. Moore was ineligible because he had a criminal record. ''What you mean I've been in jail?'' he asked her. ''Only thing I ever did was failure to appear for a traffic ticket. That ain't no felony. Man, this is crazy. This is wrong.'' Mr. Moore was told he could qualify if he moved with his mother and brother to a new apartment. But he refused. He wants his independence back. ''I know how to do things on my own, that's the way it's always been. Why it got to be different now?'' JENNIFER MEDINA STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"Six weeks after Hurricane Katrina devastated this city, President Bush flew in on Monday night with a newly upbeat focus on progress that has been made, staying overnight at the luxury Windsor Court Hotel and meeting with local officials over dinner in the French Quarter. With long-term temporary housing still an acute problem for thousands of hurricane victims, Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, planned to visit a Habitat for Humanity home-building site early Tuesday for an interview on the ''Today'' show on NBC. From there, they were to travel to Pass Christian, a gutted coastal town across the border in Mississippi, for the reopening of an elementary school. ''The president pledged that he would be a partner as the Gulf Coast region recovered and rebuilds itself,'' a White House spokesman, Trent Duffy, said in explaining the purpose of the trip. This is Mr. Bush's eighth visit to the region since Hurricane Katrina struck on Aug. 29 and his fifth to New Orleans, including the trip where he made a prime-time address from Jackson Square on Sept. 15. At least in the president's public schedule, hurricane relief has taken a back seat in recent days as Mr. Bush has battled with conservatives over his selection of Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel, for the Supreme Court. Other major developments -- including a huge earthquake in Pakistan, the winding-down of a federal leak investigation and the coming referendum on a constitution in Iraq -- have also drawn attention from the hurricane effort that dominated the White House agenda in early September. The latest trip began Monday in a meeting at the naval station in New Orleans with officials from Plaquemines and Jefferson Parishes. Then at a dinner on Monday night, Mr. Bush met with community leaders from New Orleans who are participating in the Bring Back New Orleans Commission set up by Mayor C. Ray Nagin. In his speech on Sept. 15, Mr. Bush proposed creating a Gulf Opportunity Zone that would stretch across Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to provide incentives and tax breaks for businesses in areas hit by the storm in order to speed the rebuilding process. Mr. Duffy, the White House spokesman accompanying the president on Monday night, said the proposal was ''pending in Congress'' although no legislative blueprint had been issued by the White House or sent to lawmakers. ''I think there was an expectation the White House would send a big 'Here's our recovery' package,'' Mr. Duffy said. ''I think it's more like Congress is going to be moving various pieces of legislation.'' By venturing into the heart of New Orleans's most famous neighborhood, Mr. Bush's visit on Monday was far different than his initial foray after the storm. His first on-the-ground trip, over Labor Day weekend in early September, involved a visit to the 17th Street levee and a helicopter tour. But on that swift visit, Mr. Bush did not acknowledge the chaotic Superdome where thousands of poor residents were living in squalor. In the weeks since, he has spent the night aboard the Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship in the port of New Orleans, and given a major address from downtown. On this week's trip, Mr. Bush is expected to see some signs of normalcy in the city, starting with his stay at the Windsor Court Hotel, which survived the storm with 80 percent of its facilities unharmed and is, according to its Web site, to reopen for business on Nov. 1. The Bushes dined at Bacco, an Italian restaurant owned by the prominent Brennan family of New Orleans restaurateurs. But a menu shared with reporters showed that the restaurant, known for its black truffle fettuccine, had pared back its offerings significantly. Patrons at nearby establishments in the once-raucous Quarter stopped to gaze at the motorcade, then moved on. STORM AND CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT"
"The skies cleared Monday over much of Guatemala's northern highlands, allowing rescue and relief missions to reach dozens of villages for the first time since they were hit last Tuesday by the torrential rains and killer mudslides spawned by Hurricane Stan. An American military helicopter team from Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras made stops at several cities in the province of San Marcos, which had been completely cut off from aid and, in some places, unable to communicate with the outside world. The soldiers delivered food, water, gasoline and technicians to rebuild satellite communication systems. They transported people in critical need of medical attention, as well as a group of American missionaries, out of inaccessible areas where they had been stranded. This municipality of subsistence corn farmers, which depends heavily on remittances from immigrants in the United States -- working in places from from Rome, Ga., to Georgetown, Del. -- was considered a top priority. Troubling reports have been trickling out of here since last Tuesday, but all the roads and bridges into the area had been destroyed or damaged. On Monday, authorities and community leaders here said those reports had proven accurate. More than half of the 652 deaths in Guatemala from the storm occurred in this area. Elmer Mérida, director of a community radio station that has been one of this village's few links to the outside world since the storm hit, said that the village of Nuevo Palmar in the municipality of Tacaná had been destroyed by a mudslide, and that only 50 bodies had been recovered so far. Another 80 people, taking shelter in a local church, were killed when a mountain overlooking the church collapsed on top of it. Only 20 bodies were recovered, residents said. On Sunday, they said, they gave up on finding more. Today the people of Tacaná declared the area a cemetery, and spread lime over the mud to prevent diseases. ''We don't have any plans right now, except to try to survive,'' said Víctor Pérez, 28, a peasant farmer whose family escaped the mudslide but lost what little they owned. ''The people most affected are the people who only had enough to subsist.'' Governments from Mexico to El Salvador, their countries devastated by Hurricane Stan, began discussing Monday how they would pay for rebuilding. President Vicente Fox of Mexico estimated that the reconstruction costs in his country -- principally in the states of Veracruz and Chiapas -- would reach $2 billion. He said the money would come from oil proceeds, the nation's disaster relief fund and state government emergency resources. Vice President Eduardo Stein of Guatemala estimated in an interview that repairs to bridges and highways across the country, including the two principal bridges that connect this country to Mexico, would cost $300 million. He said the country lost about $400 million in crops, including bananas and coffee. Mr. Stein said that his country was considering a range of options for paying for the work, including requiring people to buy 15-year reconstruction bonds or raising taxes, but that a government survey showed such measures to be immensely unpopular. ''We are going to have to show that we are willing to pay our share,'' Mr. Stein said, ''before we seek help from the international community.'' Still, Mr. Stein said that Guatemala had asked for $21 million in emergency help through the United Nations, and that at least two governments had made initial pledges totalling half that amount. Mr. Stein declined to say which governments until the pledges had been formalized. Bruce Wharton, a spokesman at the United States Embassy, said the United States had pledged $200,000 in aid in addition to the helicopter unit. Lane Bunkers of the Catholic Relief Service's office in Guatemala said that was not enough. Hurricane Stan has left more than 1,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands of people homeless. It also wiped out thousands of miles of roads and dozens of bridges, making it as deadly and destructive to this region as Hurricane Katrina was to the Gulf Coast. Mr. Bunkers said that ''the emergency here is still unfolding,'' adding, ''We still have hundreds of people missing. And we could be in a very desperate situation with so many people displaced.'' Elisandro Pérez walked here from a distant village, seeking food and shelter. He said he and his seven children had only the clothes on their backs and the tattered boots on their feet. ''There's nothing left in the stores where we live,'' he said. ''Our corn fields have been ruined. Many of our animals are dead and our house is close to falling down. ''We need help.''"
"It is peaceful here on the Cane River, beyond the fluffy tops of high cotton and towering magnolia trees, but it is not home. For the New Orleans Creoles living in exodus here and elsewhere around Louisiana, their city was far more than home -- it was homeland, the capital of an ethnic nation unique in this country. ''New Orleans was our womb and for most of us, it was going to be our grave,'' said Timothy Bordenave, who is living in a cottage here, a five-hour drive away from the city, describing the deep sense of lifelong connection felt to New Orleans by many of the city's Creoles, the population of mixed-race families who trace their roots to the city's French and Spanish colonial era. The Creoles have been more distinctly connected to a place -- New Orleans -- than perhaps any other American ethnic group but their rural Louisiana neighbors, the Cajuns. But unlike the Cajuns, who settled in Louisiana after being expelled from Canada by the British, the Creoles lived in the birthplace of their culture. And now, after the recent storms and the blows they dealt to Creole communities around New Orleans, scattering them to states from coast to coast, many Creoles fear that without a geographical base, their already fragile culture and their very identity could be lost. ''The Creole culture was already dying, and now I think it's gone,'' said Julie Sardie, a marketing executive from New Orleans who is living in a transplanted Creole community in Houston. Ms. Sardie's mother, Jackie, added, ''We're just sick, suffering so bad over, not the loss of our houses, but the loss of our home, our culture, the things we did.'' Many Creoles trace their roots to immigrants and slaves from the former French and Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and what is now Haiti. Historians say it was New Orleans's position as a crossroads and port town that allowed for the easy mingling of races and nationalities that in turn gave birth, in the 18th century, to a part-European, part-Afro-Caribbean society that grew to an estimated 20,000 people in Louisiana by the mid-1800's. The Creole culture that developed over generations -- known for a distinctive cuisine, language and music -- contributed to New Orleans's singular identity and helped define Louisiana to the world. Before Hurricane Katrina, experts estimated that 10 to 20 percent of black people in New Orleans -- 30,000 to 60,000 people -- considered themselves Creole by way of ancestry, but even more lived lives influenced by the culture because of their proximity to it. And now most are gone. With their geographic underpinnings swept away, many New Orleanians of Creole descent are trying to figure out how best to preserve a community separated from both its birthplace and home base. ''Everywhere you go they're trying to exist, but it's like the life's been drained out of them,'' said Ms. Sardie, who is in touch with the large group of displaced New Orleans Creoles in Houston. ''I just want to cry.'' Mr. Bordenave, who manages a restaurant, said: ''We can exist outside New Orleans, but it's easier and more natural to live in an atmosphere that reflects our history, love of music and architecture, eating and celebrating.'' As for going back home, the Bordenave family are taking a wait-and-see approach, as are many. They wonder whether the so-called new New Orleans will be anything more than a hollow imitation of the old city. ''We'll give it a year, then consider other options if New Orleans doesn't work out,'' said Curtis Bordenave, Timothy's brother, an electrical contractor whose family name appears in stone at one of the city's oldest cemeteries. Leaving the city would not be easy, he said, not ''when you loved a place and it was good to you.'' Back when they were in New Orleans, the Sardies -- Roman Catholics all, as are most Creoles -- could tell what holiday they were celebrating by what dish was on the table, they said. Gumbo des herbes meant Holy Thursday, crayfish bisque was saved for Good Friday and a cowan (turtle) feast signaled the arrival of Easter Sunday. Christmas celebrations began on the night of the 24th and usually included midnight mass and a revillion dinner featuring filé gumbo. And while most of the country associates Carnival with a single day -- Fat Tuesday -- in New Orleans the Mardi Gras season opens on Jan. 6, the 12th night after Christmas. For people like the Sardies and the Bordenaves, Carnival time was not so much about catching beads in the French Quarter as going to black-tie or masquerade parties and debutante balls in quieter parts of the city. ''Oh God, I'm going to miss that so much,'' Jackie Sardie said. ''During Mardi Gras, we might go to 15 or 20 dances. We really believed in clubs, parties and dances. It's something I fear we will never have again.'' For many, these things were the only good reasons to be in New Orleans. ''We didn't stay there for the city administration or the great benefits -- the crime and the schools were horrible,'' Ms. Sardie continued. ''We put up with all of that because our culture was there. That's the only reason we were there.'' Many, though, had already left, some to live as whites in other parts of the country. Large numbers of Creoles also departed Louisiana after World War II, frustrated with the slow pace of racial progress in the South. An even older diaspora existed before the Civil War, and it grew in the 1890's after Homer Plessy, a Creole New Orleanian, lost his Supreme Court case against John Howard Ferguson. (Plessy had been jailed for sitting in a car reserved for whites on the East Louisiana Railroad. He challenged the restriction as unconstitutional. The decision in Plessy v. Ferguson ushered in the ''separate but equal'' standard for the races.) The Creoles who left New Orleans in the past, however, generally planned their moves as families. Last month, the evacuation scattered people haphazardly, not even giving them a chance to say goodbye or tell one another where they were going. Families that had lived within blocks of each other for generations ended up in different states. ''The people I saw in church every Sunday -- where are they?'' asked Jacques Detiege, a businessman from New Orleans now living in Houston. ''People I've known since I was a kid, I have no idea what happened to them.'' The Creoles in New Orleans were an economically diverse group. Some lived in simple but historic houses in the Tremé area near the French Quarter, while others were concentrated in Gentilly and in more modern, upscale neighborhoods in New Orleans East. Large swaths of the last two areas were damaged beyond repair in the flood and are likely to be condemned. This enormous displacement is not without precedent, said James Wilson, the assistant director of the Center for Louisiana Studies at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. The Cajuns, who were expelled from Canada in the late 1700's, managed to carry on against the odds, Mr. Wilson noted. ''They were able to preserve and maintain their way of life even though only a small fraction resettled in south Louisiana,'' he said. ''They were forced to adapt and learn English, and this produced a backlash, a strong connection to their identity. The Creoles have gone through the same thing, as an outside group. They've learned to survive and maintain their distinctiveness.'' In fact, many Creoles think their recent trials will make them only stronger. ''Katrina was not a death knell for Creole culture, quite the opposite,'' Janet Ravare Colson, the assistant director of the Creole Heritage Center at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, said. ''I think it was an awakening. People want to know about their heritage now more than ever.'' Ms. Colson said that the number of people contacting the seven-year-old center for information had spiked greatly since Hurricane Katrina, and that she could hardly handle the demand on the center's limited budget. Some Creoles predict that the area around Natchitoches (pronounced NACK-ih-tish), which already had a sizable, generations-old Creole community, will become the new center of the culture. Mary Bordenave, Curtis's wife, is among those who wonder whether the Creoles will emerge better off because of the adversity. ''Maybe this was a great thing for the Creoles,'' Ms. Bordenave said. Sybil Kein, a retired English professor and New Orleans native whose Gentilly home was destroyed in the flood, said: ''We'll meet on the Cane River. We're going to have a whole lot of Creoles there, because for many of us, we can't think of any other place outside of New Orleans we'd want to be.'' It is not clear, however, what will happen to New Orleans without its Creoles. ''Much of what made New Orleans unique was the Creole influence,'' said Mary Gehman, an assistant professor of English at Delgado Community College in New Orleans and the author of several works on Creole history. ''With the razing of large areas of condemned buildings and replacing them with modern housing with faux touches, the displacement of neighborhoods, the emphasis on a Las Vegas-style entertainment destination in the new New Orleans, I fear little will survive of the original spirit of the place.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE DISPLACED"
"Guatemala isn't a war zone anymore. But it looks like one again. The bodies of hundreds of peasant Indians lay buried in mass graves above the town of Santiago Atitlán, surrounded by towering volcanoes -- except this time they were put there by nature, not men. Hurricane Stan, which hit Guatemala on Oct. 4, spawned hundreds of mudslides that swallowed entire villages, left hundreds of people dead and, not incidentally, dealt a serious blow to this country's principal source of income: tourism. In fact, this Central American country -- anointed ''the next Costa Rica'' by some in the travel industry -- had been on a roll lately. It is the setting for this season's ''Survivor'' program, usually a boon to the chosen country's tourism, and was recently listed by the BBC as one of the 10 best cultural tourist destinations in the world. Blanca Castro, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's tourism institute, Inguat, said in an interview that the central and northern tourist attractions, including the colonial city of Antigua and Maya ruins sites like Copán and Tikal were unscathed by the storms, and remain open. But she said that beach areas along the Pacific coast to the south of Guatemala City, the capital, were hit, and may take a couple weeks before they are cleaned. ''This has hit us hard,'' Ms. Castro said. ''But we are doing what we can to recover quickly and to rebuild those areas well for the tourists and for the people that live there.'' Worst hit were the areas around Lake Atitlán (above), where days of downpour washed away roads and destroyed bridges. Daniel Mooney, the director of Inguat, said that rebuilding the roads and bridges that lead into the area could take at least two months. The mudslides could not have come at a worse time for this country. This is the beginning of the high season for a tourism industry that brings Guatemala an estimated million visitors and $700 million each year, Ms. Castro said. This year, authorities had expected visits to soar close to 1.5 million -- but those expectations have been lowered since the storm. But both Ms. Castro and Mr. Mooney said a cleanup effort -- one that would clear roads, repair bridges and restore beaches -- meant that tourism would be able to come again. ''We're going to be back soon,'' Mr. Mooney said, ''and better than ever.'' GINGER THOMPSON Travel Notes"
"Shortly after noon on Saturday, Joseph Giama, a retired mechanic from Lodi, N.J., rolled quietly into a big new elementary school here in his electric wheelchair, one of the first of thousands of people expected to move into public shelters ahead of the approaching Hurricane Wilma. No one knew exactly where the storm was heading as it moved on from the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, but meteorologists were expecting it to turn toward the Gulf Coast of Florida and begin battering the state sometime Monday. The shelter at Ray V. Pottorf Elementary School here, set up for people with special health needs, was the first to open on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Shelters were also being opened in Miami-Dade County on the East Coast of the state to accommodate residents evacuating the Florida Keys. Most of the shelters are public schools, but at least one Y.M.C.A. and some churches are being used. Should the power fail, the shelters have generators and are well stocked with food, water and blankets, but they are generally no-frills operations. ''We open them if you can't find a hotel or a motel or you can't find friends or relatives to stay with,'' said John D. Wilson, the public safety director for Lee County and the commander of its emergency operations for the hurricane. Officials here issued a mandatory evacuation order for much of Lee County on Saturday. ''In essence, we're telling you rather than asking you,'' said Booch DeMarchi, a spokesman for the office of emergency management in Lee County. ''By law, law enforcement is legally entitled to take you out of your home. But that is not going to happen. In reality, we're telling people, 'If you're going to defy the mandatory evacuation order, good luck.''' Collier County officials ordered residents in low-lying areas to evacuate on Friday, and on Saturday the authorities said they were imposing a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, beginning Sunday. After watching storm victims in New Orleans on television and reading newspaper accounts in which they said they would have taken shelter from Hurricane Katrina before it devastated the city at the end of August, officials here decided to send out several buses to ferry anyone who needed a ride to a shelter. In addition, Mr. DeMarchi said, the 30 or so regularly scheduled city buses are taking those seeking shelter to collection points where shuttles are being run. By midafternoon at the Pottorf shelter, Mr. Giama, who is 87, and about 40 others had been assigned to groups of about a dozen aluminum cots in brightly lighted new classrooms, each with its own bathroom. For a late lunch, Mr. Giama went to the school's big, sunny cafeteria and got a plate of pizza, apple cobbler, tater tots and a side of peas and carrots. Steven A. Fettner, the disaster preparedness and response coordinator for Lee County, said the school could accommodate about 150 people. Altogether, officials said, Lee County was prepared to shelter more than 35,000 people. Mr. Giama, in khaki shorts and a beige T-shirt, said he had lived alone in a pair of connected mobile homes in the northern part of Fort Myers since his wife, Marge, died seven years ago. He suffered a stroke and had difficulty walking. Mr. Giama stayed in his mobile home last year as Hurricane Charley brushed Fort Myers. ''It was pretty tough,'' he said. Like the others at the Pottorf shelter, he had registered months ago with the county and buses rolled out to pick him up on Saturday. ''I got no place to go,'' he said. ''They say, 'Stay in a mobile home and you'll kill yourself.''' STORM AND CRISIS: THE SHELTERS"
"As crews begin inspecting thousands of rotting houses and preservationists begin efforts to save them, city and federal officials say that 30,000 to 50,000 of the city's houses will probably have to be demolished. That number, though smaller than some earlier predictions, nonetheless represents more than a quarter of the city's housing stock. A few weeks from now, when giant track excavators begin tearing into homes that once sheltered families and nest eggs, the city will experience one of the most painful moments of its ordeal. ''Really, the whole scope of this thing is hard to get your mind around,'' said Allen Morse, who will be in charge of the demolition effort for the Army Corps of Engineers. ''It's going to be a huge task.'' Already the dreaded bright red-orange stickers blaring ''unsafe'' have begun to proliferate on houses, signaling what is becoming a passionate debate over the extent of the demolition. Of the city's 180,000 houses, 110,000 were flooded, city officials say, and half of those sat for days or weeks in more than six feet of water. If up to 50,000 homes are beyond salvaging, many of the others could be saved with expensive repair jobs, but large numbers of homeowners may not have the resources to rebuild. As a result, the number of demolitions could soar beyond 50,000. The Corps of Engineers is being careful not to make predictions about the scope of the job. ''The word 'demolition' is not even being discussed around here,'' said Kelley Aasen, the corps official in charge of the mammoth task of inspecting every house in New Orleans for obvious structural damage. ''It's triage, right now.'' Yet as building inspectors fan out around the city, taking the first steps in deciding the fate of flooded homes, a picture is beginning to emerge on the Corps of Engineers map: red dots are sprouting in the Lower Ninth Ward, and the area below Lake Pontchartrain is a field of yellow, meaning structural damage is suspected. Houses marked with either color face a tenuous future. By midweek, about 30,000 inspections had been completed, with 7,000 houses tagged yellow and 700 red, corps officials said. Most of the hardest-hit areas have not yet been inspected. The process has not been without hiccups. The Shaw Group, the construction company that is providing many of the inspectors to the corps, provoked complaints this week from the corps and city building officials that some people hired as inspectors, including a retired art dealer and a hairdresser, were unqualified to make structural appraisals. By Friday, a corps official said Shaw had responded to the complaints, dismissing two dozen of the least qualified inspectors. City officials say it will probably not be necessary to destroy entire neighborhoods, speaking instead of city blocks. There had been earlier discussion of ending the city's preservation-review process and allowing bulldozers to plow through some of the most historically significant neighborhoods in New Orleans. That idea aroused consternation. But those fears ended when city officials promised that historic houses would get special consideration and that deluged neighborhoods like the Lower Ninth Ward and New Orleans East would not be wiped out. ''There's a recognition that the New Orleans housing stock is really pretty sturdy, and there should not be the necessity for wholesale demolition once thought,'' said Camille Strachan, a trustee emeritus of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and a New Orleans lawyer. ''I think that as the hysteria subsides along with the water, there will be a lot more rational decisions made.'' But questions remain about a process that is certain to change the face of this city for good. No one is certain when the demolitions will begin in earnest, what will happen to houses without flood insurance or whether New Orleans homeowners, facing the demolition squad, will resist en masse. Already, flashpoints have emerged in the complex interplay of municipal vision, homeowner rights and federal mandates. Some of these conflicts hark back to age-old fights here between developers and preservationists; some are brand-new, reflecting the changed, browned-over landscape in large parts of this city. City officials say that even when neighborhoods like the Ninth Ward are rebuilt, they will look very different, particularly given the staggering cost of trying to return them to something resembling their earlier state. ''People are going to be upside down when they look at the cost of rebuilding,'' said Greg Meffert, chief information officer for the City of New Orleans and a top aide to Mayor C. Ray Nagin. But preservationists say that money must be found to rebuild some of the most historic residential structures and that the demolition process must proceed cautiously. ''When you have a city that has suffered an incredible disaster, you can't overlook any economic resource, and the historic buildings are an economic resource,'' said Patricia Gay, executive director of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans, the leading local preservation group. ''This type of thing is the flesh and blood of the city.'' Officials at every level take pains to emphasize that the demolition will be kept to a minimum. ''The current thinking is, you only go tear down the absolute minimum number of homes,'' said Mr. Morse, the corps official who will take charge of what he calls a ''sensitive'' operation. ''We're trying to save as many homes as possible.'' And the officials emphasize that owners' rights will be paramount. With the demolition some time away -- ''Nobody wants to really put a marker on the wall as to when this happens,'' Mr. Morse said -- neither officials nor homeowners in New Orleans seem ready to envision the day of reckoning. ''As far as I'm concerned, I'm just going to stand still. I'm not tearing anything down right now,'' said Janie Blackmon, a loan officer who ''saved one picture of my beautiful daughter,'' but nothing else, from her home in New Orleans East. For now, there is brave talk of hanging on to ravaged neighborhoods. ''I don't care if I have to go door to door,'' said Annie Avery, director of African-American heritage preservation for the Preservation Resource Center. ''I want to save our neighborhoods.'' In practice, it will be very difficult for many homeowners to save their flooded houses. For a start, about half of them did not have flood insurance, meaning they might have to foot the entire cost of restoration themselves -- a crushing burden in a city where nearly a quarter of the residents were below the poverty level. Federal flood insurance guidelines will also require that thousands of damaged homes in floodplains be elevated by a foot or more, a fearsomely expensive proposition for which there is limited federal assistance. If the city allows those homes to be rebuilt without being elevated, it could be cut off from the National Flood Insurance Program. Finally, with homeowners all over the city desperately scrambling for contractors, the price of renovations has quadrupled to nearly $120 a square foot. On top of an existing mortgage, the economics of reconstruction quickly become prohibitive, even for yellow-tagged houses. ''New construction is a lot cheaper than renovation,'' said Jay Williams, a local insurance agent. Homeowners will be given the final say on whether their houses will be torn down, but they will have a limited time to decide whether to renovate or demolish. After that, the city can order an unsafe house to come down. ''At some point, we have to have a cutoff,'' said Michael Centineo, director of the Department of Safety and Permits in New Orleans. ''When it becomes a public nuisance, when it becomes a blight.'' For now, the piles of debris outside many homes here, put there by owners who are gutting them, testify to the hope that houses and neighborhoods can be saved. Yet uncertainty about the future prevails. ''We're not really getting feedback as to how much of the neighborhood is going to be rebuilt,'' said Bari Landry, past president of the Lakeview Civic Improvement Association in the middle-class northwest corner of the city. ''No one is really giving us the information we need.'' STORM AND CRISIS: DAMAGE"
"Hurricane Wilma stalled over the Yucatán Peninsula yesterday, pounding the Mexican beach cities of Cancún and Playa del Carmen and stranding tens of thousands of tourists in hot, leaky shelters while a maelstrom of howling winds, uprooted trees and hurtling debris raged on all sides. Forecasters said the slow-moving tempest would probably hit Florida early tomorrow, perhaps with diminished force. But with haunting images of Hurricane Katrina still lurking, thousands of Floridians and state officials were taking no chances. Gov. Jeb Bush and local officials ordered mandatory evacuations, starting with 80,000 residents of the vulnerable Florida Keys, linked to the mainland by a single road, and of Naples and Marco Island on the southwest coast. The streets of Key West were nearly deserted by midday. Residents of Florida's west coast, meantime, got out, or -- playing a dangerous waiting game -- gathered supplies and boarded up. Traffic jams backed up on highways, and scattered gasoline shortages were reported. [Page 28.] In the Yucatán, at least four deaths were reported, two in a gas tank explosion in Playa del Carmen and those of a woman electrocuted in Cancún and a 69-year-old man killed by falling branches in a neighboring state. The number of injuries in Mexico was unknown, as was the extent of property damage, but it was widespread and expected to run into many millions. Five homes were destroyed and 1,000 others were damaged in Playa del Carmen. In Cancún, 50 hotels and hundreds of homes were damaged, public buildings were crumbling, windows were shattered and a coast known as a tourists' playground overlooking a turquoise sea was transformed into a vast region of danger and destruction. The storm also washed out roads in mudslides and devastated countless shacks and jungle cabins that are home to the Yucatán's impoverished people, tens of thousands whose lives are largely hidden from the tourists behind the facades of the high-rise hotels and the postcard-perfect, white-sand beaches. The numbers in these backcountry slums have been swollen by the migration of poor Mexicans seeking work in the booming tourist industry, centered on the Mayan ruins and the pristine beach resorts. Five hundred miles across, packing winds of 140 miles an hour, the hurricane slammed into the Mexican mainland late Friday as a Category 4 storm about seven hours after its eye rumbled over the island of Cozumel, a cruise-ship port 11 miles offshore. While the storm lost power slightly, becoming a Category 3 storm by midmorning and a Category 2 storm by afternoon, with sustained winds down to 110 m.p.h., its power remained awesome as it came to a standstill over the Yucatán, where it was expected to remain for two days. That prolonged the misery of hundreds of thousands of residents of the Yucatán and 30,000 tourists riding out the storm in shelters with little food and water. But it gave a reprieve to southern Florida, where the hurricane was expected to hit next. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for the Florida Keys and Collier County in southwest Florida yesterday, although thousands had already left. By dawn yesterday, huge waves were crashing over the narrow strip of beachfront at Cancún. At the Xbalamqué Hotel, one of a number of resorts that had been turned into shelters, terrified tourists and local residents huddled as windows were blown in and the building shook. ''I never in my life wanted to live through something like this,'' Guadalupe Santiago, 27, a cook, told The Associated Press. ''There are no words to describe it.'' Outside, cars were crushed under fallen trees, the air was filled with a debris of broken furniture, metal sheets of roofing and pieces of buildings that were coming apart. Pay phones jutted up from waist-deep floodwaters and beachside tiki huts had been washed away. In some sections of Cancún's beachfront hotel district, which lies between the ocean and a lagoon, the floodwaters were more than six feet deep. One shelter in downtown Cancún had to evacuate 1,000 people overnight because its ceiling appeared ready to collapse. Five prisoners were reported to have escaped from a jail when a fence blew down. Isolated looting and a dozen arrests of suspected looters were reported in Cancún, a metropolitan area of 700,000 people. Relief was on the way, officials said. Two Mexican Air Force planes brought in the first emergency supplies, but were forced to land in the state capital, Chetumal, 200 miles south of Cancún. It was unclear how long it would take to move the supplies to the stricken areas along roads disrupted by mudslides. Offshore, on the tourist haven of Isla Mujeres, more than five feet of rain was reported to have fallen in 24 hours. Moisés Ramirez, the civil defense coordinator of Playa del Carmen, a resort popular with European and American tourists, said his community had been devastated. ''Playa is destroyed,'' he told Agence France-Presse. The Mexican government, whose resources had already been stretched thin by the heavy damage of Hurricane Stan in the neighboring state of Chiapas earlier in the month, said the navy was sending six helicopters and four amphibious vehicles, along with 600 troops, a dozen mobile drinking water plants and 50 emergency power generators. At 2 p.m. yesterday, the hurricane's eye was inland over northeastern Yucatán about 10 miles southwest of Cancún and about 400 miles southeast of Key West, Fla. Some residents ventured out briefly to survey a flooded landscape littered with floating office furniture, broken boards, painted signs, roofing shingles and other debris sloshing around fallen tree trunks, downed power lines, drowned cars and shattered storefronts. Others waded through the foul-smelling water in search of relatives or shelter. Raúl Rivera Placios, director of emergency administration for Mexico's interior ministry, said that more than 72,000 people had been evacuated from Quintana Roo and Yucatán States before the hurricane hit Mexico. But tens of thousands of tourists and residents found themselves sleeping on the floors of hotel ballrooms, schools and gymnasiums, reeking of sweat because there was no power for air-conditioning. Power was cut off to most of the region as a precaution against fire. Telephone service was also cut off. Hotels being used as shelters pushed furniture up against windows, but shrieking winds blasted through the barriers and water poured in through broken windows. Cancún's Red Cross director, Ricardo Portugal, said 11 pregnant women had gone into early labor and had to be ferried to hospitals. The hurricane, which had killed 13 people in Haiti and Jamaica, was expected to drift northeastward over the weekend, sideswiping Cuba before bearing down on Florida. Cuba braced for coastal storm surges and flooding and evacuated more than 550,000 people, including 425,000 from the island's western side. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Alpha formed yesterday in the Caribbean Sea, The Associated Press reported, setting the record for the most number of storms in an Atlantic hurricane season. Alpha is the season's 22nd tropical storm and marks the first time a letter from the Greek alphabet has been used because the list of storm names is used up. The previous record of 21 storms was set in 1933. At 8 p.m. yesterday, Alpha had sustained winds of about 40 mph. It was centered about 70 miles south of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, and moving northwest at about 15 m.p.h., forecasters said. STORM AND CRISIS: HURRICANE WILMA"
"Three lawsuits have been filed in the past week stemming from a bus fire that killed 23 residents of an assisted-living center and nursing home as they fled the approach of Hurricane Rita. Named in the suits was Global Limo Inc., which operated the 1998 Motor Coach Industries bus that was involved in the incident, said a clerk with the Hidalgo County District Court, where the lawsuits were filed. A call to Global's lawyer, Mark Cooper of San Antonio, was not returned. A spokeswoman for the Bus Bank, the Chicago charter-bus broker that the nursing home contacted for service, said the company's chief executive, William R. Maulsby, was unavailable for comment. The bus was transporting residents and employees of Brighton Gardens in Bellaire. It caught fire and was rocked by explosions on Sept. 23 on a highway south of Dallas. Investigators are not sure what caused the bus fire, but they are certain that oxygen canisters in the passenger compartment and in cargo holds exploded. Texas officials said last week that the bus had an expired registration but was allowed back on the road under a waiver signed by Gov. Rick Perry, which was intended to provide as many vehicles as possible for the evacuation and relief effort. One of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of an 85-year-old victim, Mary Gillette, and seeks damages from Global and other defendants, including the bus driver, Juan Robles Gutiérrez, 37, who is being held on immigration charges. That suit contends that Mr. Gutiérrez does not speak English, leaving passengers unable to communicate with him, and that he failed to conduct checks on the ''faulty brake system and worn tires'' of the bus. Jamison Gosselin, a spokesman for Sunrise Senior Living, which owns Brighton Gardens, said the company was ''disappointed to be included in any lawsuit.'' STORM AND CRISIS: EVACUATION"
"The good news for travelers on cruises affected by hurricanes is that unlike a hotel, a ship can move out of the way. That's not always adequate consolation for passengers sailing an itinerary different from the one they booked, but after two active hurricane seasons, some cruise lines are giving customers more options when scheduleschanges. All cruise lines reserve the right to skip or change ports during a cruise, a not-infrequent occurrence in hurricane season. Companies aren't required to compensate passengers in those cases, but some do offer partial refunds, shipboard credits or discounts on a future cruise. Susan Robison, a spokeswoman for Norwegian Cruise Line, said her company decides case by case. If a ship's departure is relocated a short distance -- say, from Miami to Fort Lauderdale -- passengers would not be allowed to cancel without penalty. But for bigger shifts, the line is trying to be more accommodating. For instance, Norwegian is relocating the Norwegian Sun from New Orleans to Houston beginning Oct. 16, then to Miami in mid-January, changing the itineraries as well. Anyone booked on the Sun can cancel and get a full refund; those who choose to sail from the new ports get a $50 on-board credit. Whenever a cruise is canceled, passengers are entitled to a full refund, but Carnival Cruise Lines allows customers to cancel without penalty if a ship's departure port changes, according to Jennifer de la Cruz, a company spokeswoman. Passengers who book their own air fares, however, usually have to deal directly with the airline if their cruise's schedule changes, though Royal Caribbean did offer to compensate passengers up to $100 for airline change fees necessitated by cruise delays in Galveston caused by Hurricane Rita. Passengers who chose to cancel, though, were only given a credit toward a future cruise, not a refund. ''I wouldn't say there's been a huge outpouring of generosity, but cruise lines have certainly gone beyond what is required,'' said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor of CruiseCritic.com, an online forum and guide. SUSAN STELLIN ADVISORY: TRAVEL NOTES"
"All the people James Derbes knows here had something to do when they returned home, whether it was throwing out ruined furniture or ripping up waterlogged carpets. But for Mr. Derbes, the choices seemed endless. Should he start with the hundreds of e-mail and phone messages in his law office? Or should he begin to empty out dozens of apartments he owns because the tenants are not coming back? Should he try to clean up his own home while his wife stayed in Houston? With a guess-I've-got-to-start-somewhere shrug, Mr. Derbes ended up in the front of his bed-and-breakfast, a sprawling 19th-century inn on Bayou Road. At least there he could put his assistant to work, raking leaves out of the courtyard. ''She's supposed to be a secretary, but there's no air-conditioning in the office, and she came back here to help and this is the best choice,'' Mr. Derbes, 60, said the other day as he wiped sweat from his brow. ''Not like any of this will be done any time soon anyway.'' Before the storm, he profited from his array of enterprises. Now they just mean more work for Mr. Derbes, who has traded in his weekday suits for a T-shirt and shorts -- a relaxed outfit that matches his approach to the storm damage. One of the inn's columns, which had been infested with bees, was toppled during the storm, but he was more thankful than disappointed. ''Maybe we'll finally get rid of the nests that have been in there,'' he said with a weary chuckle. The storm also knocked down one of his favorite ornaments on the grounds: an angel that had stood atop an old wrought-iron fountain that had taken months to restore. Mr. Derbes lifted the heavy figure, trying to show the grandeur it once had. ''This is something really special,'' he said. ''I don't really know how I'll fix it.'' He did not dwell on the loss, picking up his cellphone and thinking aloud about the next task. ''I have to try and call all of my tenants to see who's staying where they are and who isn't,'' he said. Some first steps to recovery were already behind him. He had taken a small refrigerator from one of the guest rooms to replace the one he threw out of his home. ''I bought some milk, cheese and a few bottles of Corona,'' he said. ''That's all I'll need for at least a little while.'' JENNIFER MEDINA THE LEAK INQUIRY: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"IN an evacuation, New London emergency managers know how many cars are likely to hit the streets on a summer weekend and how many on a winter evening. In Bridgeport, officials have calculated the population of the city's hurricane flood zones and specified which will be moved first in an evacuation, and by what route. But in Westport, the evacuation plan says simply that the emergency director will ''coordinate transportation required for evacuation'' and leaves the details moot. Darien's plan similarly calls for ''appropriate evacuation routes to protect and move people away from the different types of hazards the town faces,'' with no elaboration on the potential hazards or the appropriate routes. Connecticut vests municipalities with the authority and obligation to figure out how to move residents in a disaster. But a review of some of plans shows wide divergence in the amount of planning that has been done. Most, state officials say, have adopted a bare-bones model that basically details who is in charge and directs them to come up with a plan on the run that fits the emergency. ''Some towns do an excellent job and put a lot of work into it and make it way beyond what you would expect,'' said Wayne Sandford, deputy commissioner of the State Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. ''In other towns, probably the large majority, you're going to find it's the boilerplate language.'' At a time when the fear of natural disaster and terrorism is at a peak, state officials have begun to worry about how to move residents out of harm's way. The possibility of a Katrina-like storm is at the forefront, but terror and nuclear accidents are also on people's minds. At the moment, the state doesn't have its own plan, but relies instead on the municipal plans. Many plans have not only given little detailed thought to what an evacuation would look like within their own community, they also mostly ignore one another, raising the prospect of a free-for-all if disaster affects several municipalities at once. ''Look at Hurricane Rita,'' Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. ''Mass flight will create gridlock, and whether it's rational or not, you have to plan for it. We have to learn from these disasters.'' Gov. M. Jodi Rell has called on her new Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, along with public-safety and transportation agencies, to come up with the state's first evacuation plan by year's end. ''If, for any reason, we need to evacuate citizens from any part of the state because of a natural disaster or terrorist attack, I want to be certain we have firm blueprints and an actual plan in place,'' the governor said in a statement. She added, ''Nothing should be left to chance.'' For now, there is a patchwork of local plans that often make few actual plans. Darien's document is typical and sounds authoritative: It says that between 5 and 20 percent of its residents will evacuate before being told to do so. Some will refuse no matter what the threat, and many of those will be pet owners, it says. Most will evacuate in their own cars, but some will require vans and buses provided by the authorities. Eighty percent will find shelter in motels or the homes of friends and relatives, but the rest will require mass housing. All of those specifications, though, are in many other town plans, because they are part of a model plan suggested by the state emergency management agency. ''It's a bare-bones plan that reflects the local needs, does not reflect the regional or statewide needs, and it's not complete in my eyes,'' said Marc McEwan, the Darien emergency management coordinator. He added in an e-mail message, ''Our town officials are currently trying to place more specific information into the plan for an all-hazard evacuation plan.'' Some of the state's larger towns have more detailed documents. Bridgeport and New Haven include maps showing flood and hurricane inundation zones. Bridgeport breaks its flood areas into groups for staggered evacuation and indicates streets to be used for moving people to the north. New Haven's plan includes locations and schematic diagrams of schools that can be used as shelters. But there is a widespread realization that most municipalities are not prepared. ''They're very generic and very basic,'' said Scott Appleby, the emergency director in Bridgeport, of some of the smaller municipalities' evacuation plans. ''You have to do something to make sure those towns don't just rely on them, and that they really think them through. The state has to provide something to these smaller towns.'' Mr. McEwan, of Darien, said: ''I think that's the key. The state should say, 'You're either going to be in the game or you're not, and if not, we're going to do it for you.' '' But Mr. Sandford said the state has no authority to do that. ''The state cannot go in and say you have to change your plan, because it's their plan,'' he said. Instead, he said, the state will push municipalities to work together with nearby towns to prepare a regional arrangement that can be coordinated and assisted by his office. ''The mayor of New Haven has said he feels confident he can evacuate New Haven, but once I evacuate, I don't know where they will go,'' Mr. Sandford said. ''That's what we need to work on.'' Dianne Farrell, the first selectwoman in Westport, acknowledged that the town's plan for evacuation ''doesn't go far enough,'' but said officials have made evacuation plans that aren't in the official document. She said the problem is that ''evacuation planning cannot be handled on a strictly local level.'' The Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security is a new agency, created on Jan. 1 out of two bureaus that used to be in the Department of Public Safety and the Military Department. It hopes to solve the evacuation problem by creating a regional planning level as a stand-in for the county governments that Connecticut lacks. ''Most of the towns' local plans look the same,'' said Melissa Leigh, assistant director of the South Western Regional Planning Agency, 1 of 15 regional planning organizations set up in the 1960's after Connecticut did away with county government. ''When they fall apart is when you have a disaster that affects more than one.'' Mr. Sandford's paradigm is the small city of New London and surrounding communities. They have the state's most highly developed regional evacuation plan, and the reason is simple. ''If there's such a thing as a benefit to having a nuclear power plant nearby, this is it,'' said Reid Burdick, the director of emergency management in New London. ''We can open a book and know where the cars are going.'' Extensive evacuation planning is a prerequisite to the licensing of the Millstone nuclear plant in Waterford, and it has ensured that nearby municipalities coordinate and cooperate. ''We think we will use the Millstone plan as the model we begin with,'' Mr. Sandford said. ''They have primary and alternate routes, and they have host communities pre-identified.'' The communities around the Millstone plant also regularly drill on the plan. New London dispatches school buses to simulate student evacuations, packing them, empty, to designated staging areas. Years ago, East Lyme authorities even packed the buses with students and drove them to New Haven, which had agreed to serve as its ''host community.'' ''We don't physically move people any more,'' said Pearl Rathbun, director of emergency management in East Lyme. ''But we have to demonstrate annually that we are capable of warning and moving the public.'' Mr. Blumenthal and other officials have also cautioned that events outside the state's borders must be considered as well. Although no Connecticut community is within the 10 mile radius for evacuation planning of the Indian Point nuclear plan in Buchanan, he said he believes people in Connecticut will want to flee. ''We're talking about hundreds of thousands of people not just in New York, but in Connecticut,'' he said. ''There has to be thorough and expert planning and assessment as to how move people out of that area.'' Mr. Blumenthal also points out that people fleeing disaster in New York will be moving to and through his state, overwhelming major arteries that are already clogged on a good day. Although the governor has called for such plans to be ready within three months, officials are already saying they won't make her deadline. ''It will probably take a little bit longer than that,'' Mr. Sandford said. ''It's not going to be done overnight.'' Connecticut Correction: November 6, 2005, Sunday A map last Sunday with an article about municipalities' evacuation plans misidentified a river that flows through Bridgeport west of the Pequonnock River. It is the Rooster River, not the Mill River. (The Mill River, which is farther west, was not on the map.)"
"There is life after Wilma. While that hurricane struck Cancún and the surrounding area in Mexico hard from Oct. 21 to 23, services -- and tourists -- are coming back. Le Meridien Cancún began taking guests again on Nov. 16. The Gran Costa Real, which is partly open, will be at full service by Dec. 1. Several thousand more rooms, including those at Le Blanc Spa Resort and the all-inclusive Dreams Cancún, are expected to open by the end of December. The Maya Riviera, the popular coastal stretch south of Cancún, was spared extensive damage, with 83 percent of its hotel rooms sscheduled to be open by Nov. 30, according to the Mexican tourism board. Nearly all rooms will be open by the end of December. Over the week of Nov. 14, cruise lines returned to Cozumel, including Carnival, Norwegian, Princess and Royal Caribbean. Up to five ships a day are now coming in, said Michele Paige, president of the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association, a trade group. Still, the docks have been damaged (one could take up to two years to rebuild), so for now, ships are anchoring offshore and ferrying passengers to shore. Also on Cozumel, the tourist board said 18 dive shops are ready for business. And in a surprising development, some of the beaches are actually wider -- one on the east coast of Cozumel and another along Cancún's hotel zone -- according to local tourism boards. Despite these developments, however, many travelers have changed their holiday vacation plans. The Ritz-Carlton resorts in Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Florida all had an increase in reservations from guests who switched from the Cancún property, which had to close, said Vivian Deuschl, corporate vice president for public relations. It should be repaired by May, she added. After the Fairmont Mayakoba, on the Maya Riviera, had to delay its opening until spring, Fairmont put together comparable packages at its properties in Acapulco, Miami and Scottsdale, Ariz., a hotel spokeswoman said. Some travelers are just switching coasts. American Express Travel has rebooked hundreds of customers to alternative spots in Mexico, according to Desiree Fish, a spokeswoman -- particularly to resorts on the Pacific, including Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta and Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo. Of course, on the east coast, much work remains. In Cancún, above, over half of the hotel rooms are still closed and seven and a half miles of beachfront won't be fully restored until July, according to Rodolfo Elizondo, secretary of tourism for Mexico. But most hotels on Cozumel, he said, will be open by the end of January. Two official Web sites offer updates for travelers, including hotel openings: www.islacozumel.com.mx, run by the Cozumel tourism board, and www.cancun.info, from the local convention and visitors bureau. But getting to the area by air could be tough, with major airlines running on reduced schedules. American, US Airways and America West plan to add flights in December and be close to full service by February. Continental will also add service in December, while Delta won't add to its one daily flight until May. United has canceled its flights, and will re-evaluate its schedule in a few weeks. LISA KALIS ADVISORY: TRAVEL NOTES"
"WHEN Wall Street returns to full operations after the Thanksgiving weekend, traders will have a big batch of economic reports to sink their teeth into. Government data is expected to show strength in job creation, economic output, consumer confidence and orders for durable goods. Economists polled by Bloomberg News forecast improvement in each measure, but they are hardly going out on a limb. Rosy readings for October and November are expected because the economy spent those months snapping back from the disruption caused by the summer hurricanes. Any spate of good results may belie a deceleration in the economy, especially consumer spending, warned David Rosenberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. ''Retail sales have shown no net change since June,'' he said. ''Momentum on consumer spending going into the fourth quarter was deep in negative terrain. This is going to be one of the weakest fourth quarters we've seen in years.'' Another troubling sign, he said, is that ''the housing sector is clearly rolling over.'' Mr. Rosenberg expects the softness in consumption to bring an end to the economy's streak of 10 consecutive quarters of at least 3 percent annual growth in the gross domestic product. This has been the longest such run since ''the Reagan go-go years of the mid-80's,'' he said. ''The days of 3-percent-plus G.D.P. growth are behind us,'' he said. ''The numbers will be closer to 2.5 percent in coming quarters. The slower growth is going to be led by housing and consumers, and we're going to find employment growth slowing.'' DATA WATCH -- Any slowdown is likely to be postponed at least until December. The Bloomberg News consensus calls for the employment report, due Friday, to show that 205,000 nonfarm jobs were created this month, up from 56,000 in October. Mr. Rosenberg expects the report to show 180,000 new jobs. The Bloomberg News poll predicts a turnaround in the Tuesday report on durable goods -- products intended to be used for three years or more. The consensus calls for a 1.5 percent increase in orders in October after a 2.1 percent decline in September. Later on Tuesday, the Conference Board will issue its monthly gauge of consumer confidence. The economists polled by Bloomberg forecast a reading of 90 for November, up from 85 in October. Evidence of a housing slowdown may arrive Monday, when sales of existing homes are expected to show a drop for October, to 7.2 million units from 7.28 million. More of the same is expected the next day in the report on October sales of new homes. MARKET WEEK"
"Has the American voter's ardor for cutting taxes and shrinking government cooled? Voters in California, Colorado and Washington State rejected ballot measures this month that would have rolled back tax increases or limited state spending. Some say the votes could mark a turning point in a decades-old revolt against high taxes that got its symbolic start in California in 1978 with Proposition 13, which sharply limited property tax increases for homeowners and cut deeply into state services. It may be, some analysts suggested, that after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and this year's Gulf Coast hurricanes, Americans saw the value of government investment in infrastructure, public safety and other services and are now more willing to pay for it. ''It looks like that to me,'' said John G. Matsusaka, president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California Law School. ''The public sector did a lot of belt-tightening during the last recession, and the public now appears to be letting it out a few notches. I think we saw that in Washington State and Colorado.'' On Nov. 1, Colorado voters approved a ballot proposition that would allow the state to keep a projected $3.7 billion in tax revenue over the next five years rather than return it to taxpayers. In California last Tuesday, voters resoundingly defeated Proposition 76, supported by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The measure would have limited state spending and given the governor broad new powers to cut spending when state revenue lagged. And in Washington, an initiative put on the ballot by antitax groups failed last week by a six-point margin, letting stand a 9.5-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax passed by the Legislature. In California, Mr. Matsusaka said, voters ignored Mr. Schwarzenegger's appeals to give him more power to cut state spending and tuned out television advertisements warning that the rejection of Proposition 76 would mean a big tax increase next year. In New Jersey, which has the highest property taxes per person in the nation, voters elected Senator Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, as governor last week, even though he promised a more modest reduction in property taxes than his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester. ''People are still concerned about spending, but it's not a front-burner issue for them,'' Mr. Matsusaka said. ''They're more concerned about wanting to put money in for education.'' Advocates of cutting taxes and limiting public spending said, however, that the three ballot results were responses to specific situations and did not mark the beginning of some sort of backlash. ''I don't see it,'' said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and one of the nation's most vocal tax opponents. ''I would be very sensitive to it and sweating over it if it were happening.'' California voters, Mr. Norquist said, were in a sour mood over the special election last week when they voted down the spending cap and all seven other measures on the ballot. Washington voters succumbed to warnings that roads and bridges were crumbling and that the gas tax was needed to avert disaster. And, he said, Colorado voters were hoodwinked by a ''traitor'' Republican governor, Bill Owens, into voting for a huge tax increase. (Governor Owens's argument was that limits had locked spending at levels that were far too low to handle the state's increasing population and cost of services.) ''All trends start with small sets of data points,'' Mr. Norquist said when asked if the three votes could mark a major shift in public opinion. ''But if you flesh in the picture for the year, that's not the case at all.'' Mr. Norquist pointed to a proposal in Oklahoma in September that would raise gasoline taxes to pay for highway construction and maintenance. It was defeated by 87 percent to 13 percent. He said that while Colorado residents voted to lift the spending cap, they also turned down a $2.1 billion bond issue for transportation. Voters in West Virginia also rejected a big bond issue to underwrite the state's pension funds. Mr. Norquist said he was working with tax-limitation groups in Maine, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma and Oregon to put spending limits before voters in 2006. He said lawmakers in several other states were also considering new caps on state spending, using a variety of formulas involving population growth and inflation. Kim Rueben, a public finance economist at the Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said the outcome of the votes this year was not sufficient to establish a trend. But Ms. Rueben said that for the past several years voters had been willing to increase taxes or approve bond issues when they were designated for tangible improvements. On Tuesday, voters in Maine, New York and Ohio approved bond issues totaling nearly $5 billion to pay for transportation projects, water systems, college buildings and research programs. ''Starting in the late 1990's, there has been more emphasis on the state of state infrastructure, and effort to get new money in and new things built,'' Ms. Rueben said. ''I think in general people want roads and are happy to fund them. But they are less willing to just turn over money to the state and let officials decide how to spend it.'' That was how Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, a Democrat, went about trying to save the gasoline tax increase that barely passed the Legislature on the last day of the session in May. After the tax bill squeaked through, opponents quickly gathered 400,000 signatures to put a measure on the Nov. 8 ballot to repeal the increase, which will take effect in increments over the next three years. The money is dedicated to the repairing and seismic retrofitting of the state's highways, bridges and tunnels. Governor Gregoire said in an interview that two rockslides that closed the Interstate 90 pass through the mountains of eastern Washington and the damage along the Gulf Coast from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita helped her cause, by showing what can happen when state infrastructure is in poor condition. ''Their levees are our bridges,'' Ms. Gregoire said, referring to New Orleans. ''People here were skeptical, but Katrina brought the message home loud and clear.'' She added, ''People here who have been antitax for a number of years now said: 'We're not going to leave our safety at risk; we're not going to leave this to our kids. We're going to invest.' '' The repeal measure was voted down by 53 percent to 47 percent, but a look at a map of how Washington residents voted is revealing. Twenty-nine of Washington's 39 counties voted to repeal, many of them by margins of 20 or even 30 percentage points. The measure failed because the heavily populated, more liberal counties around Seattle and two college towns in eastern Washington voted against it. In other words, when it comes to taxes, Americans are still divided."
"Officials in California worry about the collapse of aging levees in the delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, which might allow surging seawater to contaminate much of the state's drinking water supply. A major concern in Seattle is the seismic vulnerability of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, a busy elevated highway in such peril that weight and lane restrictions were imposed on buses and trucks. In Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, there is the recurring danger of a volcanic eruption at Yellowstone National Park, while in Florida, attention has turned anew to cleaning up Lake Okeechobee, which sends polluted water into nearby rivers during heavy rains and floods. While the problems are mostly well known, the devastation from the Gulf Coast hurricanes is serving as a strong reminder that possible disasters could lay waste to cities and states across the country. People are calling government offices about emergency preparedness, long-forgotten plans are being dusted off and reassessed, and lawmakers are holding hearings about vulnerabilities and whether efforts to address them go far enough. ''Katrina woke us up again,'' said Susie Stonner, a spokeswoman for the State Emergency Management Agency in Missouri, where flooding along the Mississippi River in 1993 caused billions of dollars in damage but where building in flood plains has resumed. ''Since 9/11 most of our efforts have been focused on terrorism, and it's time to start thinking we have natural disasters, too.'' Robert S. Young, an associate professor of geosciences at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, N.C., who conducts hurricane research for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said this year's hurricane season had people in government and out seriously considering an old idea: that the federal government cut off its investments in coastal areas repeatedly hit by hurricanes, including those in North Carolina. Professor Young, who recently testified about the subject before a Congressional committee, said that there had long been resistance among environmentalists to construction along the coast, but that now lawmakers and taxpayers' groups were also questioning federal subsidies for things like flood insurance and rebuilding roads. ''There is no question that more people are interested and more willing to listen to the possibility of the federal government abandoning the coast,'' he said. ''People are finally realizing how costly this is.'' In some places like Utah, where a $200 million project is under way to mount the State Capitol on cylindrical bearings to reduce the shaking during an earthquake, officials said the hurricanes' destruction was a reminder that expensive disaster preparedness programs needed to stay on track. Scientists at the University of Utah estimate there is a one in four chance that a major earthquake will rock the Wasatch fault in the state in the next 40 years, with the Capitol among the buildings most in jeopardy. Similarly, seismologists in Washington have said that the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which suffered severe cracking in an earthquake several years ago, will not survive a major quake, and efforts are under way to replace it with a tunnel. ''It has reinforced the importance of what we are doing and why,'' Derek Jensen of the Utah Department of Public Safety, said of the hurricane season. Maj. Scott J. Smith of the Montana National Guard said officials there were looking anew at the problems that a major earthquake -- and a possible resulting volcanic eruption at Yellowstone, where the caldera is classified as a ''high threat'' by the United States Geological Survey -- would pose in assembling troops. The experience in Louisiana, Major Smith said, had illustrated that many of the people who would be called upon to deal with a disaster might also be among its victims. ''It certainly has been an eye-opener for all of us,'' Major Smith said. ''One specific area we are now looking at is where are we going to bring the resources, knowing we might not have all the soldiers we need.'' National park administrators at Yellowstone and elsewhere have been instructed to review their emergency plans with the lessons of the hurricanes in mind. Kevin FitzGerald, chief ranger for visitor and resource protection for the eight-state intermountain region, said the reassessments had been ''for the most part preaching to the choir,'' since periodic reviews were routine. But with the severity of this year's hurricane season, Mr. FitzGerald said, taking extra stock is warranted. One task whose importance was reinforced by the problems in New Orleans, he said, was making sure park officials had emergency contact information for all of their employees so they could be accounted for after a disaster. ''You take that,'' Mr. FitzGerald said of the communication problems among law enforcement agencies after the hurricanes, ''and you learn from it.'' Though flooding is a recurring problem in much of the Midwest, the post-hurricane emphasis in Missouri has been on earthquakes, said Ms. Stonner of the state emergency management agency. The last big earthquake in the New Madrid seismic zone in the state was nearly 200 years ago, but seismologists have warned that the Central States, including Missouri, remain ripe for a significant temblor. State and municipal officials in the region are determining whether generic disaster plans, written with flooding, tornadoes and other more common calamities in mind, are adequate for the particular problems posed by a catastrophic earthquake. As a start, a map has been posted on the Missouri agency's Web site showing 47 of the state's 114 counties that would sustain the brunt of a major earthquake, with splashes of yellow and orange signaling the most vulnerable areas. ''Local officials saw what happened in Louisiana, and they are concerned,'' said Ms. Stonner, referring to the hard-hit roads and other damaged infrastructure in that state. ''A lot of the time, you assume, say, that you would be able to get to the airport in St. Louis. But if you look at the earthquake map, that area is marked yellow in a bad-enough earthquake, which indicates the airport would probably be closed.'' In San Francisco, a more arcane issue, the size of fire hydrant valves, has set off a growing debate, as critics question the wisdom of exempting the city from a state law that requires all fire departments to have standardized valves and hoses. The law was imposed after fires swept through hills of Oakland in 1991, killing 25 people and causing more than $1.5 billion in damage. Spurred by renewed fears of a natural calamity that might set off fires like those that destroyed much of San Francisco in 1906, the city's fire chief, Joanne Hayes-White, has recommended keeping a reserve of adapters on hand so neighboring departments could readily help in an emergency. Another proposal under consideration would require retrofitting about 8,000 hydrants in the city. In Sacramento, nerves have also been newly rattled. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger requested $90 million in federal assistance in September to increase what he said was ''woefully inadequate flood prevention'' in the Sacramento area. Yesterday, the United States Senate approved legislation to allocate $39 million to improve flood control in Sacramento and about $2 million for other flood control projects in the area. The problematic levee system there is part of the same network in the delta that protects millions of acres of farmland, drinking water for about 22 million people and, increasingly, housing developments on the distant fringe of the San Francisco Bay Area. Without major improvements to the system, scientists at the University of California, Davis, recently predicted, there is a two in three chance in the next 50 years that a major earthquake or storm will cause widespread failures of levees, which would allow salt water to back up into the delta and be drawn by pumps into the state aqueduct. Some water officials are revisiting the idea of building a canal around the delta to help keep drinking water safe, a highly charged proposal that California voters rejected in 1982. ''Even New Orleans had a 250-year level of flood protection,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger wrote in a letter to members of Congress. ''Sacramento only has about a 100-year level of protection.'' Larry Larson, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the hurricanes and the subsequent flooding in some Northeastern states, including New York and New Jersey, had grabbed the attention of emergency planners and elected officials like few other recent natural disasters. Still, Mr. Larson predicted, the window of opportunity for translating the hardship into better preparedness is not very large. While many cities and states seem genuinely interested in tackling problems, he said, some of that interest will wane when the costs and other political obstacles loom larger. ''It's been a wake-up call,'' Mr. Larson said. ''We need to figure out if we are ready to hear it.''"
"IN recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Wilma, hard-hit Mexican resorts like Cancún face two equally daunting challenges. The first, to physically restore and rebuild this part of Mexico's Caribbean coast, which was battered for 60 hours by torrential rains and winds that reached 110 miles an hour, is expected to take at least several months. The second, to repair the public relations damage that was inflicted during the recovery process (or, according to some bitter vacationers, the lack thereof), could take much, much longer. The plight of many of the tens of thousands who got caught in the storm and its chaotic aftermath -- and who were stranded in underequipped shelters with little food or water -- have some repeat visitors questioning whether they will ever return to the region. At the very least, some tour companies and hotels may have lost more than a few potential customers and almost certainly need to rethink their emergency procedures. About half of the stranded tourists ended up in emergency shelters, while others fled the area or managed to get rooms at low-rate hotels downtown. Most were finally released from shelters, only to find the Cancún airport was wrecked. After days living on tuna fish and crackers, dozens of angry tourists said they were disgusted with tour companies and hotels, which they charged failed to warn them about the storm, then after it was over, gave them little or no information. Several said they were told by representatives of tour companies that they would lose their return tickets if they left the shelters, which had become so unsanitary people were becoming ill. ''There was some guy from Expedia telling us we had to stay at least 48 more hours for them to get us out of here,'' recalled Jesse Corning, a 32-year-old pipe fitter from Kenai, Alaska. ''This is after five days in shelters with no running water. I said no way. We are not staying here.'' (Katie Deines, a spokeswoman for Expedia, said the agent who talked to Mr. Corning had not accurately reported company policy. During hurricanes, she said, Expedia will change or cancel travel arrangements at no extra charge in order to get customers onto a different flight or into a hotel.) Mr. Corning and his wife, Jacinda, were interviewed while waiting in the Mérida airport, 200 miles from Cancún, where thousands of Americans had been bused. Mr. Corning had just paid $1,000 to get a Mexicana flight to Dallas the next morning. ''All I know is, I'm going to get to American soil, and I am never coming back,'' he said. If there are more people like the Cornings -- and interviews with several other vacationers suggest there are -- then tourist officials and hotel companies in resort areas like Cancún and Cozumel have a lot of work ahead of them to try to restore some good will. And they don't have much time to do it: Wilma hit the Mexico coast on Oct. 21, just two months before the area's peak holiday season. On the first sunny day, President Vicente Fox went to Cancún and promised that the region would be 80 percent ready by Christmas -- an optimistic appraisal, given that local tourism officials say that up to 90 percent of Cancún's hotel rooms had been damaged and that tons of the resort's powdery white beach sand swept to sea. Nonetheless, in the days after the storm, tourism officials and hotels throughout the region began issuing bulletins on when they would reopen. The Riviera Maya Tourism Promotion Board reported that 60 percent of the hotels in the area would be operating early this month and that by Dec. 15 that figure would be 90 percent. Much of Playa del Carmen is now open for business, according to Michael Halle, a spokesman for the tourist board, who said that Tulum, like much of the southern Riviera Maya, fared better than the northern stretch. Among the luxury resorts in the area, the Ikal del Mar spa and resort, about 10 miles north of Playa del Carmen, suffered moderate damage and will reopen in mid-December, while Amansala, another resort near Tulum, reopened six days after the storm struck. Barceló Hotels and Resorts, a Spanish chain, said that two new hotels it is building on the Riviera Maya will open on schedule in December. But in Cancún and on the resort island of Cozumel, the news was uncertain. Barceló had no date for the reopening of its two Cancún hotels. Marriott Hotels announced that it was closing the Ritz-Carlton, Cancún and its two other hotels through the end of the year. Palace Resorts, the largest hotel operator in the region, was expected to reopen three of its seven resorts by Christmas, according to John McCarthy, director of Mexico's tourism development fund. But the Palace's Cozumel resort would not reopen until April 1. Hyatt Hotels said the Hyatt Regency Cancún would remain closed until March 1 while a second hotel, the Hyatt Cancún Caribe Villas and Resort, would reopen Feb. 1. InterContinental Hotels said its two resort hotels in Cancún and Cozumel would be closed until Jan. 31, along with a Holiday Inn in Cancún. Grupo Posadas, Mexico's leading hotel chain, which has some 1,700 hotel rooms in the area, including the luxury spa Fiesta Americana Aqua, announced that its hotels would be closed until Dec. 15. The cruise business has also been hit hard. Because of damage to the piers at Cozumel, Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises are suspending stops at the island indefinitely. Underscoring the urgency to rebuild both the region's infrastructure and its image, a determined President Vicente Fox returned to Cancún on Oct. 27. ''Whatever it costs, we have it,'' Mr Fox said as he landed. But the costs will be extraordinary. The reinsurance company Partners Re estimated the damage at $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And with almost 60,000 hotel rooms, Cancún and the Riviera Maya are losing $15 million every day that tourists stay away. Whatever the timetable for repairing the infrastructure, there are other problems to address, like the anger of American tourists, many of whom had bought package vacations from low-cost charter companies and charged that those tour company representatives all but disappeared during the storm. Some tour companies, though, were said to have done a decent job of evacuating their clients to Mérida. Among them was Thomson Worldwide, a British company, which flew in dozens of agents, arranged for buses to carry tourists from resorts around Cancún to Mérida on Monday and then helped to find them flights out. Cathy Pelaez, chief operating officer of Liberty Travel, based in Ramsey, N.J., said that although there was little that could be done in the two days following the storm, Liberty representatives checked on their clients in storm shelters and, as soon as charter flights could be booked, transported about 700 guests by bus straight to the tarmac of the Cancún airport. How awful one's experience was depended very much on where one stayed. Those who had booked rooms at the JW Marriott or the Ritz-Carlton in Cancún said they were relatively well cared for. Once Wilma arrived, Marriott International transported its guests aboard buses to a high-class (and solidly constructed) brothel near the airport, where they were served three meals a day throughout the ordeal. (Apparently, the prostitutes were not present.) Later, Marriott International and its subsidiary The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company chartered buses to take 239 guests to Mérida and then hired two jets to carry them to Mexico City and Atlanta, at no charge. But finding a plane out of Mérida was not easy for everyone. For instance, Todd Bahel and his girlfriend, Christine Zabkowski, from Baltimore, endured four nights in a shelter in Cancún, until they boarded a bus to Mérida. ''We were told this ride would take five hours. It took 10,'' Mr. Bahel said. On the bus's arrival, the police told them that the Mérida airport was closed for the night. They spent another night in a shelter, and on Tuesday tried to procure a flight -- any flight -- to the United States. A ''near riot'' broke out in the terminal while boarding passes and flight manifests were scribbled onto pieces of paper, Mr. Bahel said. At least one private plane departed with no passengers aboard because of infighting with airport bureaucrats. On Oct. 26, five days after their scheduled return flight, they arrived at Dulles Airport, near Washington. ''I wouldn't go back to Mexico,'' Mr. Bahel said. ''But then I think about the staff of the hotels and how heartbreaking their stories were and how compassionate they were to help us, and I feel differently.'' Correction: November 6, 2005, Sunday An article today on Page 3 of the Travel section about Cancún, Mexico, after Hurricane Wilma includes an outdated reference to the Fiesta American Grand Aqua hotel. After the section had gone to press, the hotel announced that it would reopen in the spring, not on Dec. 15."
"NOV. 30 is the official end of the hurricane season, and many residents of the Gulf Coast region will empty the water from their backyard barbecues and invite their neighbors over to celebrate survival. The governors of Florida and Louisiana are encouraging their weather-weary citizens to make it a day of rejoicing and reflection. Some relief organizations will stage events to show their appreciation to the many volunteers who continue to work to help storm victims. ''Our volunteers outdo themselves during hurricane season, and we like to provide an opportunity for them to get together to unwind, relax and swap war stories,'' said Chris Floyd, director of emergency services for the Red Cross in Tallahassee, Fla. There will be a picnic on Dec. 3 in the parking lot of his building for 500 field volunteers. ''We'll have fried chicken, ham and cole slaw, lots of pies,'' Mr. Floyd said. ''If there's one thing the Red Cross knows how to do, it's how to feed lots of people.'' One end-of-hurricane-season celebration open to the general public will be the Pirates in Paradise Festival, a 10-day blowout in Key West, Fla. Scheduled events include a Nov. 30 beach party at the Pier House Resort, where meteorologists from the National Weather Service and improvisational actors dressed as pirates will burn nautical hurricane-warning flags. That evening there will be a buffet and a silent auction at El Meson de Pepe, a restaurant, that will benefit people harmed by hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma. After dinner, Lorian Hemingway will read from the account her grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, wrote about the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys. Pirates in Paradise runs from Nov. 25 to Dec. 4, with numerous other parties and literary events as well as historical re-enactments and daily sailing ship cruises. Pirates will skirmish at sea and on the beach at Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park; food will be served and arts and crafts vendors will sell their wares. ''You build up a lot of tension during hurricane season, and this is a good release for us and a way to let the rest of the world know we're still here, that we haven't been blown away,'' said Julie McEnroe, an organizer of the festival. Prizes will be awarded at the end of the festival for the best pirate and ''wench'' costumes. Another event celebrating the end of hurricane season is R & R Day, also known as the Resiliency and Rebuilding Festival, staged by the Miami Museum of Science and Planetarium on Nov. 30. The staff at the museum's Wildlife Center and Rehabilitation Hospital has been nursing birds and other animals hurt during this year's storms. Some of them, rested and ready to return to the wild, will be released to start the festival, which will also feature science demonstration booths on such topics as making rubber from rubber trees and isolating banana DNA. Hundreds of children from schools in areas hard hit by recent storms are expected to attend. In Texas, residents of Galveston will celebrate the end of the hurricane season as they have since 1974, with the opening of the annual Dickens on the Strand Festival, Dec. 3 to 4. The mayor, Lyda Ann Thomas, will read a proclamation declaring the end of storm season and the opening of the Victorian-inspired festival, which takes place in the island's Strand District, a National Historic Landmark with late-19th-century architecture. Actors and musicians will roam the cobblestone streets in period costume, and there will also be parades, craft and food vendors and six entertainment stages. Proceeds will benefit the Galveston Historical Foundation. Galveston always breathes a collective sigh of relief at the end of hurricane season. It was devastated by a hurricane in 1900 that claimed an estimated 8,000 lives and remains the worst natural disaster in American history. This year, it narrowly escaped Hurricane Rita, which struck East Texas. ''The 1900 storm that destroyed Galveston is a part of our mindset,'' said Molly Dannenmaier, spokeswoman for the Galveston Historical Foundation.

"Mold left the footballs as white and fluffy as sheep. Players' sodden shoes became as fuzzy as bedroom slippers. An equipment shed floated into the next neighborhood. In the weight room, 100-pound iron plates had been flicked about like poker chips. Hurricane Katrina left Holy Cross High School in six feet of water when it submerged the Lower Ninth Ward in late August. Still, school officials were determined to play football this season. Before the hurricane, Holy Cross had expected to make a deep playoff run among Louisiana's largest schools. After the storm, even with star players displaced and enrolled elsewhere, football could serve as an act of resilience and resolve. ''We weren't going to let our school die,'' said Principal Joe Murry, who explained to his faculty that despite the school's academic credentials, ''the community doesn't easily see the A's and B's and C's you give, but football says we're back and we're not going away.'' A satellite campus was established 75 miles away in Baton Rouge, where the players practiced each morning at a middle-school field, showered at a YMCA and attended classes from 4 to 9 p.m. Two dozen or more players made the trip each night back to the New Orleans area, then awakened for another long commute in the morning. In late September, Holy Cross became the first New Orleans school to resume football. The Tigers won four of six games in a truncated season, finished second in the downsized Catholic League, preserved the state's longest continuous rivalry with the 87th meeting against archrival Jesuit High School and made the playoffs, which open Saturday with a long trip north to Shreveport. The five-hour drive will be a welcome inconvenience in a season both terrible and wonderful and marked by grand improvisation. Holy Cross's student body president, who had never put on a football uniform, became a valuable contributor by snapping the ball for field goals and extra points. A moving van served as a mobile locker room and coaches' office. Discarded cleats from Louisiana State were salvaged with a strong dose of disinfectant. ''I'm amazed at what the kids put up with to play football,'' Coach Barry Wilson said. ''Half of my kids have lost everything. This has united them, given them a chance to smile and laugh and not hear the bad news on TV constantly.'' High school football schedules all over southern Louisiana became storm-tossed debris in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Thirty-one teams canceled their seasons. Of the 160 teams that reached the state playoffs among 5 classes, only 44 played a full schedule of 10 regular-season games. Life remains far from normal for teachers, students and administrators at Holy Cross, which has no habitable campus, no home field and no certainty about the future of the Lower Ninth Ward, where the school is tucked between the Mississippi River and the breached Industrial Canal. A largely white school for boys in a predominantly black section where one-third of the residents live below the poverty level, Holy Cross, founded in 1879, anchors a national historic district featuring the architecture of shotgun and steamboat houses. Some scientists have suggested that the low-lying area become a flood plain, while Mayor C. Ray Nagin has vowed that the ward's devastated neighborhoods will be rebuilt. On Tuesday, Holy Cross students returned to New Orleans to a shared campus with the girls at Cabrini High in Mid-City. Football practices have been held from 9 to 11 a.m. at a playground in suburban Metairie, followed by classes from 2 to 7 p.m. Lives remain shoved off their foundations like houses in the Lower Ninth Ward. Greg Battistella, the Holy Cross athletic director, and four players are living above a business office owned by the father of another player. Football, too, still requires considerable ad-libbing, like plays drawn in the dirt. Paul Schuler, a junior, returned to school this week after evacuating to Memphis for Katrina, but he had to practice Wednesday without a helmet while officials scrounged for one. ''It feels good,'' Schuler said. ''I'm home.'' Familiar rituals seemed as if they might never resume after Katrina's arrival on Aug. 29. Ronnie Adams, an assistant coach, said the force of water overflowing the Industrial Canal sailed a car onto Holy Cross's practice field, while a storm surge up the Mississippi River spit trees over the levees as if they were toothpicks. Adams rode out the hurricane in neighboring St. Bernard Parish and estimated that he helped rescue 150 to 200 people by boat. Then, fearing that forced evacuation would leave him stranded and perhaps unsafe at the Astrodome in Houston, Adams said he stole four boats and 275 gallons of gasoline and led his parents and others on a six-and-a-half-hour trip up the Mississippi to Baton Rouge. ''I did what I had to do to survive,'' Adams said. Within days of the hurricane, the upwelling for football began as a signal of Holy Cross's buoyant spirit. Helmets and shoulder pads had been stored atop newly constructed lockers on a stage in the school gym, above flood level. The team's blue jerseys and gold pants had also been stored in a loft that remained dry even though skylights and a portion of the gym roof peeled away. On Sept. 21, the Dunham School in Baton Rouge began sharing its campus for classes. Holy Cross's season opener was scheduled two days later, but was scuttled by the approach of Hurricane Rita. It was just as well. The Tigers needed all the practice they could get. Moncell Allen, one of the state's top running backs, had moved to North Carolina. Lance Lacoste, the starting quarterback, had relocated to central Louisiana. Among those now playing for Holy Cross were boys so inexperienced that some didn't know what a huddle was, Wilson, the coach, said. ''We had to tell them, 'Get in a circle,' '' he said, laughing. At least one newcomer did possess a reliable skill. Gregory Orkus, the student body president, always considered himself too small to play football. Even now, his listed height and weight, 5 feet 10 inches and 160 pounds, must surely include his full uniform. In previous seasons, he served as a manager and led cheers in the student section. But he also had a knack for snapping the ball on punts and extra points. ''It's much different being on the field,'' Orkus, a 17-year-old senior, said. ''In my uniform I feel huge, untouchable.'' One of the regulars who returned was the resourceful Cass Hargis, who has played receiver, running back and quarterback and has remained determined even though his family lost its home and possessions in St. Bernard Parish. All he recovered, he said, were a few shirts that had to be power-sprayed at a car wash. After Katrina, Hargis moved to Natchitoches, La., where he scored three touchdowns on Sept. 16 for St. Mary's School. The next morning, he turned in his uniform and headed toward New Orleans, excited that Holy Cross was resuming football for his senior season. Relaxed transfer rules made him eligible immediately. ''We've lost everything, but we feed off each other,'' Hargis, 17, said. ''Football is the only time you can get away from everything. On the field, nothing we face is tougher than what we've been through in our personal lives.'' On Sept. 29, Holy Cross finally played a game, traveling with 35 or 40 players to Monroe, where the Tigers lost, 27-7, to highly ranked Ouachita High. Battistella, the athletic director, called the defeat ''the greatest victory in the history of Holy Cross.'' When a sportswriter told him, ''You didn't win,'' Battistella said he replied, ''Oh, yes we did.'' A week later, Holy Cross traveled southwest of New Orleans to play Vandebilt Catholic of Houma. Two thousand fans made the trip and were rewarded with a late 27-20 victory, when Holy Cross's Phillip LeBlanc retrieved a botched snap on a Vandebilt field-goal attempt and returned it 85 yards for a touchdown. ''Divine intervention,'' Battistella said. ''But it was two Catholic schools, so it was O.K.'' Afterward, Holy Cross players engaged in an enduring custom, the ringing of a 200-pound victory bell that was cast in 1860, the year the Civil War began. In previous seasons, the team returned after each victory to campus, where, still wearing their uniforms, senior players hoisted each other in an archway to ring the bell. After the victory over Vandebilt Catholic, the bell was mounted between two pickup trucks and rung in the parking lot of a Target store. If the celebration was less elegant, it was no less cherished. ''More healing took place that night than if a team of psychiatrists from Harvard and Yale came down to counsel people,'' Battistella said. Eventually the team grew to 61 players, including 35 regulars. One of the returnees was defensive end Marc Hoerner, who left a 9-0 team in northern California to complete his senior season at Holy Cross, saying, ''This is where I'm from, where I belong.'' Holy Cross's most satisfying victory came with a 20-10 triumph over nemesis Jesuit High, a yearly rival since 1922; several times they played more than once a season. It was Jesuit that Holy Cross defeated to win its second and most recent state championship, in 1963. And it was Jesuit against whom Orkus, the student body president, finally got to play in his first game. ''I never thought I'd get the chance,'' Orkus said. ''My father was crying. He's never been prouder of me.'' Last Saturday, Holy Cross played Archbishop Rummel for the championship of the Catholic League, losing by 20-7, but advancing to the playoffs as a wild-card selection. On Saturday, the Tigers will wear their familiar blue and gold, a nod to a long affiliation with the University of Notre Dame, with which Holy Cross shares an alma mater and fight song. According to local folklore, Notre Dame's fight song was written by one of the brothers at Holy Cross. ''There's no definite proof,'' Charles DiGange, headmaster at Holy Cross, said. En route to the 1925 Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., where Notre Dame claimed its first national championship, Knute Rockne and a team that included the Four Horsemen took a train through New Orleans and practiced at Holy Cross, DiGange said. Photographs of that visit survived Katrina. On Saturday, the laconic Coach Wilson will most likely not summon the bombast of Rockne, finding no need for a ''win one for the Gipper'' speech. The success of this hurricane-interrupted season resonates far beyond victory and defeat. ''I'm proud of the kids who stayed and fought through this,'' Wilson said. FOOTBALL"
"When the federal government and the nation's largest disaster relief group reached out a helping hand after Hurricane Katrina blew through here, tens of thousands of people grabbed it. But in giving out $62 million in aid, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red Cross overlooked a critical fact: the storm was hardly catastrophic here, 160 miles from the coast. The only damage sustained by most of the nearly 30,000 households receiving aid was spoiled food in the freezer. The fact that at least some relief money has gone to those perceived as greedy, not needy, has set off recriminations in this poor, historic capital where the payments of up to $2,358 set off spending sprees on jewelry, guns and electronics. Though a majority of the money appears to have been given out legally, the United States attorney's office is investigating at least 1,000 reports of fraud, including accusations that people lied about claims of damage or where they lived. State and local officials are criticizing FEMA and the Red Cross as doling out money without safeguards, but they also blame their fellow citizens. ''The donors all across this nation thought they were giving money to put food in the mouths of people who had nothing and clothes on the backs of people who had lost everything,'' said State Representative John R. Reeves, who represents Jackson. ''But that is not what happened here. There was a feeding frenzy. Free money was being handed out.'' And friends have turned against friends. When word of the Red Cross and federal money got out in Jackson's neighborhoods, many rushed to apply. Huge lines formed at Western Union outlets, discount stores and other places that issued or cashed the relief checks. Erica Thompson, 32, tried unsuccessfully to persuade her friends not to join in. ''People can take a good thing and abuse it,'' Ms. Thompson said while doing her wash at a coin laundry in Jackson this week. ''It's not right.'' Some of those who accepted the aid, though, feel no embarrassment. ''I needed that money,'' said Lynn Alexander, 30, whose apartment lost power in the storm, but was not damaged. She collected $900, she said, from the Red Cross. ''It helped me put gas in my car, wash my clothes and buy food.'' What happened in Jackson and its suburbs -- in Hinds, Madison and Rankin Counties -- might not be unique. Emergency officials elsewhere in Mississippi and in parts of Louisiana have also questioned how so much federal aid could have been authorized, given the limited damage they documented. ''Someone is going to have to look at that,'' said Bo Boudreaux, deputy director of homeland security in Iberia Parish, west of New Orleans, where perhaps three mobile homes were damaged, he said, but 404 families, according to FEMA, received $2,000 checks in emergency aid. FEMA, which is leading the $62 billion Hurricane Katrina relief effort, has been criticized as responding slowly to the disaster and then wasting recovery money. In defending the payments in the Jackson area, the agency and the Red Cross cited the tensions between moving quickly to help the desperate, and moving carefully to avoid aiding the undeserving. ''This is the challenge we perpetually face,'' said Nicol Andrews, a FEMA spokeswoman. ''Do you get assistance into the hands of those who desperately need it as quickly as possible? Or do you slow it down to dot every single I and cross every single T? We chose to err on the side of the victim.'' Charles D. Connor, a senior vice president at the Red Cross in Washington, said his group had a similar imperative. People who brought in a form of identification were eligible for aid. Mr. Connor acknowledges that apparently resulted in aid being offered to some who did not need it. ''We did the best we could to help people as quickly as we could knowing that mistakes would be made along the way,'' he said Friday. Donald Paxton, executive director of the Central Mississippi Chapter of the Red Cross added: ''Unless you drove down every street in Hinds County, there was no way of immediately determining actually what the damage was.'' FEMA and the Red Cross have made disaster assistance payments in the past that have drawn criticism. After Hurricane Frances in Florida last year, FEMA distributed $31 million to residents in the Miami-Dade area despite minimal damage. Senator Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican whose committee oversees FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security, said in an interview Thursday that the agency had apparently failed to correct problems auditors found in Florida. ''It is frustrating to me that FEMA seems incapable of paying legitimate claims quickly and effectively and yet reimburses fraudulent claims without asking any questions,'' Ms. Collins said. ''It is the worst of all worlds.'' Open for Aid After Hurricane Katrina devastated coastal communities on Aug. 29, it moved steadily inland toward Jackson. Smack in the middle of Mississippi, the capital city has been in slow decline for more than a decade, struggling with high crime, long-simmering racial tensions and poverty. By the time the hurricane reached this far, its power had diminished. The sustained winds, recorded at 47 m.p.h. at the airport, were far below hurricane speed. But gusts of up to 74 m.p.h. took down trees, knocking out power lines and damaging roofs. Almost all of Jackson lost power. Electricity returned for most customers in a few days. But in some cases, it took up to two weeks. Still, the region was largely spared. In Jackson and two nearby counties, only 50 to 60 homes were declared uninhabitable, local emergency departments said. About 4,000 sustained damage, they said. Immediately after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the Bush administration declared a disaster area along 15 Mississippi coastal counties, as well as 31 parishes in Louisiana. Residents there were eligible for federal emergency grants, housing assistance and money for repairs, medical bills and other costs. But by Sept. 7, at Mississippi's request, the disaster zone was expanded as far as 220 miles inland, reaching 32 counties, including several that never experienced sustained hurricane-force winds. The zone eventually reached 47 counties. The disaster area in Mississippi -- which is led by Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican ally of President Bush's -- extends 200 miles farther north than that in Louisiana, which is led by Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, a Democrat who at times criticized the federal storm response. Lea Stokes, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said it was the course of the storm, not politics, that dictated the map. The state urged the Bush administration to include so many counties in the disaster zone after documenting widespread damage. The state encouraged all residents to apply for aid, even if the only cost they incurred was the purchase of a chainsaw or generator. ''Let them tell you whether or not you qualify before you rule yourself out,'' Ms. Stokes said, echoing the advice offered by Mississippi officials. Ms. Andrews, the FEMA spokeswoman, said the federal government typically deferred to states on disaster declarations. But when that happens, she acknowledged, the door is opened for federal aid. ''Once we effectively turn on a county, anyone in that county can apply,'' Ms. Andrews said. And the Red Cross, Mr. Connor said, followed the federal lead, authorizing aid for Jackson just as it did for residents of New Orleans. A Rush for Checks Even before Hurricane Katrina landed, the Central Mississippi Chapterof the American Red Cross began preparing. The charity opened a shelter at the Coliseum and Trade Mart in Jackson for evacuees from the coast. Soon after, the Red Cross also began offering cash grants ranging from $360 for a single adult to $1,565 for a family of five. Ms. Alexander, who is unemployed, remembers phone calls from her cousin, then from her therapist. The Red Cross, she was told, was giving out money to Jackson residents. Ms. Alexander drove to the Trade Mart, but chose not to wait for her turn because the crowd was so large. Back home, she called the charity's toll-free telephone number dozens of times before finally getting approval for $900 in aid. She had to give her name and address, she said. The only storm damage at her apartment was spoiled food in the fridge. ''I was blessed,'' she said. Michael Hendrick had also gone to the Trade Mart, broke, homeless and hungry after fleeing the Louisiana coast. He listened as Jackson-area residents plotted the best way to get the biggest grants. ''It was really kind of turning my stomach,'' Mr. Hendrick said. Before the rush subsided, the Red Cross gave $32 million to area residents, including about 25,400 of the 92,000 households in Hinds County, home to Jackson, according to statistics first published in The Clarion Ledger and confirmed by Mr. Paxton of the local Red Cross chapter. FEMA received 42,313 applications from Hinds County and 17,352 claims from Madison or Rankin Counties. To date, 16,407 of those applications have been approved, resulting in a payout of $20.3 million in disaster grants, as well as $9 million in rental assistance and other aid, agency records show. Most of the federal money was intended for people whose homes were uninhabitable, but it was distributed before any home inspections were conducted. The relief checks soon created a crush of customers at local businesses. A clerk at Quik Cash, a check-cashing store, said a line of more than 100 customers stretched down the hallway, out the door and around the corner. So many people showed up that the business ran out of cash. Lee Montgomery, the manager of Terry Road Pawn Shop in Jackson, said many of those cashing relief checks at his business immediately bought jewelry, firearms, DVD movies and electronics. Bob Parks, owner of a Hinds County pharmacy and Western Union agency, said he watched in disbelief as hundreds of Jackson-area residents arrived at his store to get relief checks. ''Surely the Red Cross has to have a better use of funds,'' Mr. Parks said. ''Unless they just have money that they are trying to get rid of for some reason.'' Unexpected Numbers Local government officials were baffled by the payouts. Weeks after the storm, Larry J. Fisher, director of the Hinds County emergency department, got a call from a regional FEMA representative saying that staff members wanted to know why county officials had reported that so few homes were uninhabitable. FEMA has sent aid to thousands of county residents who claimed their homes were ruined, including 7,622 checks for $2,000 in emergency financial assistance. But Mr. Fisher counted only about 50 uninhabitable homes and perhaps 4,000 with any damage at all. To resolve the discrepancy, Mr. Fisher recalled, he was told: ''You are going to increase your number.'' A Baptist deacon and a former city police detective, Mr. Fisher, 67, was going to have none of that. Backed up by digital photographs he had taken of damaged properties, he refused to revise his reports. ''I am not going to change my figures up to yours,'' Mr. Fisher said he told the FEMA official. ''You want to start investigating, by all means, do so.'' When asked about the conversation, FEMA officials said they were not aware of it. Officials in Mississippi fault both the Red Cross and FEMA for not having clearer -- and tougher -- standards about what kind of damage merited a claim. In the end, it appeared that simply being a resident when the storm passed through was enough to collect a check. Mr. Paxton said he realized that there was some abuse, but he could not say for sure just how much took place. If the charity failed to act responsibly, he said, it will move to correct the problems. Already, Mr. Connor said, the charity has stopped monetary aid in Jackson unless losses are documented. Marshand K. Crisler, president of the Jackson City Council, said many aid applicants perhaps honestly believed they deserved help, even if it was simply to replace spoiled food. But clearly there was abuse as well. ""People are taking advantage of a crisis,'' Mr. Crisler said. ''We are saddened that people would stoop to such a level."""
"There is 911 for emergencies and 411 for telephone numbers, and in New York City, residents dial 311 to complain about municipal services. Now support is mounting for a nationwide rollout of 211, a telephone referral service created by United Way of America and its local affiliates that links callers to social services and volunteer opportunities in their communities. Such systems were used in Louisiana and Texas after Hurricane Katrina, and were widely praised for their ability to assist victims and those helping them find resources and services. ''It was one of the few bright spots of that period,'' said George Penick, president of the Foundation of the Mid South, a community foundation in Jackson, Miss. The success of the system attracted more attention to a push begun in 2003 by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina, to establish 211 systems nationally. The system was started by United Way in Atlanta in 1997 and has spread to all or part of 32 states and Washington, D.C., reaching almost half the nation's population. It was designed to help people navigate the thicket of charities that have sprung up over the last two decades and find the best programs for their needs. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Congress saw the potential for the system in emergencies, and in 2002, it granted states permission to use federal money intended to prepare for potential bioterrorism attacks for 211 systems. But under that law, the system competes with 17 other options the states have for that money, and Senators Dole and Clinton believe that the system needs a larger, dedicated source of financing. Their bill seeks $550 million over the next five years to build and support 211 systems and requires states to put in another $300 million. Last summer, United Way led a lobbying push for the bill that increased the number of senators and representatives supporting it by 49 and was stunned when, with no wooing, 27 more members signed on after Hurricane Katrina. So far, 168 members have signed on to the bill. That 211 worked so well in the hurricane crisis also came as a bit of a surprise. It was used during the hurricanes that struck last year, but United Way officials said those storms did not challenge it the way Hurricane Katrina did. ''The calls coming in weren't your typical 211 calls,'' said Peter Bishop, the 211 manager for United Way of America. ''We don't usually deal with someone who's in their attic with water rising all around them and 911 broken down.'' Ordinarily, 211 operators help find after-school programs, rent assistance, job training, medical support and other services using databases built over months and years. ''You can pretty much chuck that database out of the window during a disaster, particularly this one,'' Mr. Bishop said, referring to Hurricane Katrina. ''None of the organizations listed in it could operate in and around New Orleans. Their phone lines were down, and the phone numbers people wanted and needed anyway were totally new.'' With the 211 system in New Orleans knocked out, Monroe, La., population 53,000, became home to the 211 system for the state. The call center in the local United Way office went to 50 seats from 4 seats over three days. Six volunteers were assigned to do nothing but seek phone numbers and information to add to the new database, and operators took calls from people who could not get through to the state's emergency services. Mr. Bishop estimated that 80 percent of calls were answered within 30 seconds, the standard that United Way has set for the system. ''It did not work perfectly,'' he said. ''Sometimes we gave out wrong information, and I'm sure not everyone could get through. But I am so proud of the 211 system.'' Mississippi did not have a 211 system when Hurricane Katrina hit, although United Way of the Capital Area in Jackson was planning one. ''Can you imagine how many 800 numbers people had to try to remember during this crisis and how much easier it would have been to remember 211?'' said Carol J. Burger, president and chief executive of the Jackson United Way. ''It would have been so much more manageable here if one phone call was all that was needed to send people to the right place with the right information. Instead, it was chaos.'' The Mississippi Commission for Volunteer Service quickly created a hot line that helped storm victims and coordinated delivery of relief supplies and volunteer services. ''We had 41 lines going 16 hours a day,'' said Marsha Meeks Kelly, executive director of the commission. ''The volume of calls is going down, but it takes the individuals answering the phone calls two or three days to follow up because the needs are more complicated at this point in the recovery.'' Ms. Burger said she hoped to have the state's 211 system in operation in January, provided that state regulators approved it. ''I visited Monroe,'' she said. ''It was amazing to sit there and see how well it operated, how they could get people going in the right direction -- and wish we had the same thing.''"
"Porfirio Guzmán Vázquez does not need a politician to tell him how long it will take to recover from Hurricane Wilma. He just looks out the hole that used to be his living room wall at the four oceangoing fishing boats beached and broken on the road outside his house. The boats are battered, holes in their sides, prows busted. Mr. Guzmán used to pilot one of them for a local fishing cooperative. There are no fish now; a month after the storm, the water is still too turbid. Everyone in this fishing village is living on slim savings and mending nets, eyes scanning the horizon for better weather. ''The crisis is very critical,'' Mr. Guzmán said. ''There's no work. There are no fish. There's no tourism.'' Throughout the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula, where a month ago Hurricane Wilma whirled with malevolent force, fishermen, hoteliers, restaurant owners, divers, nightclub impresarios and the thousands who work for them are still picking up the pieces. And everyone is hoping that not only the fish but the tourists will come back. There are signs of progress everywhere. In contrast to the halting United States response in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the Mexican government has jumped in to restore power and clear away tons of debris from the streets. The fetid water that flooded streets has receded. The flooded portions of the major roads have been rebuilt with landfill. In Cancún, construction workers swarm over dozens of battered hotels and restaurants along the famous hotel strip, racing to repair the damage before the December rush. Here and there are signs saying, ''We Are Open'' or ''Cancún Is on Its Feet.'' But the initial promise that most of the resorts in Cancún would be up and running by Dec. 15, when tourists fleeing the North American winter usually begin flocking to the Yucatán, has turned out to be overly optimistic, local officials say. ''It's going to take at least six months to recover,'' said Rangel Rosado, a spokesman for Mayor Francisco Alor. ''We all know, those of us who are living inside it. It's not that easy.'' For starters, the hurricane swept about eight miles of pristine white beach out to sea along the barrier island where many of the lavish, five-star resorts are built. ''No hotel in Cancún has a beach,'' said Jorge Hernández, the operations manager at the Gran Real Caribe. ''We have nothing. No beach at all.'' The federal government has devoted $20 million to a project that will pump the sand from its current location offshore near Isla Mujeres back to the stripped strand of rocks where the fancy hotels are. But the work has yet to begin, officials said. The damage under water was severe as well, said Jaime González, the official in charge of the coast's coral reefs. Dozens of park workers are painstakingly removing curtains, windows and other debris from the reefs and patching up broken coral with cement and plastic. So far only about 2,500 people have been laid off in Cancún, a city of 800,000 that depends almost entirely on tourism. The government has started retraining about 34,000 workers for construction jobs. In the meantime the 225,000 hotel workers have been put to work cleaning up. Many feel a deep uneasiness about the future. The publicity surrounding the storm has driven some tourists away. ''Here what is, is tourism,'' said Eva Durán, 50, a cleaning woman at the Riu Cancún Hotel. ''If there is no tourism, they will start to let people go. I think everyone's a little nervous.'' It is not just hotel workers who are nervous. Built in the last 30 years, Cancún and the resorts to its south and north drew about 7.1 million tourists last year, bringing in about $4 billion. That is one reason that two Mexican tourism officials and the governor of Quintana Roo visited New York last week to try to counter the impression left by press reports that since the hurricane the entire peninsula is a wreck. To a degree, the officials are right. Of the 59,400 hotel rooms in the region, only about 28,000 were in Cancún, where the heaviest damage occurred. Resorts like Tulum and Playa del Carmen are in good shape. Artemos Santos Santos, the head of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the city should have about 11,000 rooms available by Dec. 20. ''We are carrying out a rapid recovery,'' he said. Still, many of those rooms are in the older hotels in downtown Cancún, and several of the major resorts along the barrier island have no plans to open until spring or even summer, among them two Hyatt hotels, the Ritz Carlton, the J. W. Marriot, the Sheraton and the Hilton. Some hotels are taking advantage of the situation to carry out long-planned renovations. Others are considering more hurricane-resistant construction. Sergio Serra, director of sales and marketing for the Hilton, said a team of engineers was still reviewing the damage at the 426-room hotel. There is no way that it will open before March, he said. ''We are probably looking at taking into consideration hurricane-proof equipment and furnishings,'' he said. While the big hotel chains have the luxury of waiting to reopen, the fishermen and smaller hoteliers in Chiquilá and on the island of Holbox to the north are growing more desperate. The fishermen divide their time between catching lobsters and taking tourists to see the whale sharks that congregate just off their shores. The hurricane not only destroyed most of their larger boats and their piers, but it also severely damaged dozens of outboard motors and carried off thousands of lobster traps. On a recent day, about two dozen fishermen were patiently waiting at the Vanguardia del Mar fishing cooperative while mechanics took their engines apart and rebuilt them. Several grumbled that the government had initially offered them grants to fix their boats but then gave them loans instead. In the last month, they said, they would have normally caught four tons of fish and 225 pounds of lobster. ''We have to get the motors working,'' said Rogelio Santana, 34, a fisherman who has been supporting his two children on government handouts since the hurricane struck last month. ''There is no economy now. No money. Nothing. No tourism, no fish.'' All along Holbox's white beach, the island's small hotels were severely damaged. Several will not reopen for months. At the Villas Delfines, the manager, Dieter Biebelriether, 59, a German expatriate, said he would be ready to reopen on Dec. 15, despite the piles of debris on the hotel's front steps. ''This is for sure,'' he said. ''We have been working here day and night.'' Farther down the strand, Urvalin Coral, 50, mended his nets with a skilled hand. He was waiting for the water to clear, as he knows it will from a lifetime of fishing. He has lost 40 lobster traps -- $4,000 worth of gear. But he managed to save his engines and two launches, so he feels lucky. He said he had faith that the fish would return. ''In all my life I never passed through a storm like that,'' he said, his hands flying through his nets, fixing a hole left by a shark. ''We hope to God everything returns to normal.''"
"One of the most extraordinary hurricane seasons on record will end Wednesday, but while a six-month respite awaits, forecasters are warning that the period of intense storms could continue for years to come. The Atlantic Ocean is in a cycle of frenetic hurricane activity that started a decade ago, and there is no better evidence than the 26 named storms -- more than any other season since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began keeping records in the mid-1800's -- that formed there this year. Thirteen grew into hurricanes, the fiercest of which, Hurricane Katrina, devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast, killing at least 1,200 people. ''It was incredibly out of the ordinary,'' said Jack Beven, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''This season was such an extreme event that it's a little difficult to believe it could repeat itself on a regular basis. But it's too early to tell what the next season will bring.'' Mr. Beven said the active period, which could last up to 40 years, is the result of favorable wind patterns, higher sea surface temperatures and other conditions. Hurricanes do not usually occur until August, even though the season officially begins on June 1. But this year saw Tropical Storm Arlene soak the Gulf Coast in early June, and Hurricane Dennis, a Category 3 storm, hit the Florida Panhandle with winds of 120 miles per hour on July 10. So busy was the season that forecasters ran through their list of 21 names by October and resorted to the Greek alphabet. Three of this year's storms reached Category 5 strength, with sustained winds of more than 155 m.p.h. Hurricane Katrina alone caused an estimated $34 billion in insured property damage after making landfall near Miami on Aug. 25 and again near New Orleans on Aug. 29. Mr. Beven said that by spring forecasters would have a good sense of what the 2006 hurricane season would bring. But they cannot look ahead yet, for Tropical Storm Epsilon formed on Tuesday in the Atlantic. ''I think it's exceeded all our expectations,'' Mr. Beven said."
"The generator people are internal colonists, staking out islands of light in the sea of dark still covering much of the city. In lives where the monstrous, belching backyard power generator is king -- where a streetlight flickers tantalizingly, say, in the near distance, but their own block is black -- the machine's subjects must follow its rules. Every night at 1 a.m. it calls Willie Solomon, 62, or her husband, Raymond, 68, into the cold and dark, out of the warm bed. Armed with a flashlight, they feed it: two five-gallon cans of gasoline a day, and sometimes more depending on what is plugged in. But they do not plug in too much. The fuel bill already runs $135 a week. It naps at noon and is ready for ear-splitting action again at 5:30 p.m. Barely more than a quarter of this city's prestorm households are illuminated by the power company. Some neighborhoods have limped on since Hurricane Katrina; others have barely budged. When night comes, these electricityless pioneers -- nobody knows how many there are -- live in a shrunken world, reduced to a few lighted rooms, inside their house, on a darkened block. Scavengers roam, they say, and it is best not to be out. The roaring beast gives back power in exchange for the gas, through long, snaking cords running all through Ms. Solomon's frayed camelback house in the St. Roch neighborhood, in the Eighth Ward of the city. At night, with a few rooms illuminated by a naked bulb, she must walk on tiptoe to avoid tripping on these tentacles, taped fast to the linoleum. Water for washing is heated on a hot plate and dumped into a big plastic bucket; baths are military-style rubdowns in a darkened, chilly bathroom; red beans are cooked on a low-power crockpot; and laundry is done by hand. ''Other than that, I just say, I just got to go back to the old days, pretend I'm in the country,'' said Ms. Solomon, a good-humored former Los Angeles school district guard who says her 30-year absence from the city she calls ''Noo Erlens'' pained her. ''I'm living the old-time way; I never thought I'd go back to the country,'' Ms. Solomon said. ''Yes indeed, it's pitch-black.'' She sleeps in a sweatsuit, wears a big fur-lined hat in bed and walks around the cold house during the day in what she calls Eskimo boots, lined with plush fur. Doorways are hung with blankets, to cut down on the penetrating, chilly draft of a late New Orleans autumn, and windows are sealed up with plastic sheeting. Cold is as much of an enemy in these uninsulated old wooden houses as the intense heat of summer. ''Yeah, the country,'' Ms. Solomon said. ''Being in the country.'' She and a neighbor, Brenda Batiste, are the only ones on this semi-abandoned block off Elysian Fields Avenue. Ms. Batiste, 62, has domesticated her generator, covered it with a leopard-skin cloth and a turtle yard ornament, and keeps it dormant much of the time. She cannot afford to run a refrigerator on it, uses candles at night and must unplug the televisions to turn on the hot plate. Her little shotgun home is darker than Ms. Solomon's house. ''This is three months,'' she said. ''It starts to wear on you, your outer being as well.'' At night, the glow from the illuminated French Quarter and Faubourg Marigny, a mile or more distant, casts a pale light on the block. This area flooded, though not as extensively as the nearby Lower Ninth Ward. Every so often the innards of an emptied house are spilled onto the sidewalk: Sheetrock, toys, beer cans, CD's, bits of clothing, a stool. A neighbor one street over said he chased two looters out of a house on a recent evening, and faced down another pair with a .22-caliber revolver. Many front doors swing wide open day and night, and some may never be locked again. ''At about 5:30 everybody's inside,'' Ms. Solomon said. ''You've got to worry about the thieves.'' All the neighboring houses have been broken into, she said, adding, ''I don't even know what they're looking to steal.'' The police say they are aware of the looting problem and have formed squads to deal with it. Arrests have been made, police officials say. But this is not a welcoming environment. Ms. Solomon, with her rooms stuffed full of toys and teddy bears for the grandchildren, her portrait of John F. Kennedy by the door and a refrigerator -- turned off -- covered with outlandish magnets, is not giving up. ''I've been fussing with the utility companies for the longest time,'' she said placidly. ''I've been fussing and fussing. Sometimes, I think they're punishing me for being here. There's one little old lady here, and they can't even get my lights on.''"
"Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Wilma thrashed populous South Florida with winds of up to 110 miles per hour, most of the region's electricity is restored but government officials are scrambling to find housing for thousands of families with ruined homes. From mobile home parks in rural Palm Beach County to condominium complexes near Fort Lauderdale and apartment buildings in Miami, roofs were battered or torn off. Heavy rains last week worsened the damage, collapsing hundreds of ceilings that had barely survived the hurricane and forcing many more people into emergency shelters. Many of those people awoke to emergency officials' pounding on their doors and announcing that they had 15 minutes to gather what possessions they could and leave because their building was unsafe. Some were elderly. Many were struggling financially even before the hurricane hit on Oct. 24. On Thursday, the Red Cross was still housing 1,253 people in 10 shelters around the region. Broward County, where the storm inflicted the worst damage, had the highest shelter population: 551 people, all at the county's last open shelter, in Hollywood. Miami-Dade County had 217 people at a single shelter, while Palm Beach County had 307 and Monroe County, home to the Keys, had 40 people at two shelters. But elected officials said the homelessness problem was much larger than those numbers implied. Many hurricane victims are staying with relatives, they said, but may soon need subsidized housing. Some are sleeping in cars, because the few shelters are far from their workplaces or their children's schools. ''Their stories are overwhelmingly sad,'' said Mayor Kristin Jacobs of Broward County. ''They have had an extraordinary circumstance fall smack in the middle of life and put them in an environment where they never in their wildest dreams thought they would be. And they are mortified that they are there.'' They are people like Sandra Distefano, who gave birth three days ago to a daughter, Rita Marie, but on Thursday was back at the Red Cross shelter at McNicol Middle School in Hollywood. Mrs. Distefano said that her Pompano Beach home lost part of its roof and that she and her husband were waiting for a disability check so they could leave the shelter. ''It's been rough on my nerves,'' Mrs. Distefano, 30, said. ''I need somewhere to go where it's just my husband and I and the baby.'' Laura Howe, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, said that unlike after Hurricane Katrina, the agency would not pay for victims to stay in hotels this time because other options were available. But the Red Cross will continue operating shelters in South Florida for as long as necessary, Ms. Howe said. Finding the homeless a place to live is especially tough in South Florida because the housing market, heavy on luxury condominiums, is among the nation's priciest. The Federal Emergency Management Agency agreed this week to pay up to twice the fair market value of rent for storm victims here. The affected counties are also clamoring for FEMA to provide travel trailers and mobile homes, just as it did in other parts of Florida after last year's hurricanes and on the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina. But trailers have just begun trickling in -- FEMA hopes to install about 55 at a park in Broward County by the weekend -- and officials said they were a last resort. ''Would you rather have a 20-foot trailer or a one-bedroom apartment?'' said Ricardo Zuniga, a FEMA spokesman. ''An apartment is something that is more like home that really helps them recover.'' In all, more than 450,000 Floridians have applied for help from FEMA since the storm, including 176,403 in Broward County, 141,283 in Miami-Dade County and 82,985 in Palm Beach County. About $57 million in grants has been approved in the 13 counties hit by Hurricane Wilma, with the most, $14.5 million, going to Broward. Even many whose homes remain intact need help: thousands lined up this week for food stamps to replace groceries lost during power failures. Among them was K. E. Reynolds, 75, who said her home in Oakland Park had been dark for 16 days. ''I live on an extremely fixed income,'' said Ms. Reynolds, who waited in a food stamp line in Pompano Beach with her cane and inhaler. ''I go to the food bank as it is. I had to throw away everything in my refrigerator. I don't have the kind of money to replace it.'' The storm knocked out power to 3.2 million households and businesses, and many people, a large number of them elderly, went a week or more without it. But all but 10,000 customers had their electricity restored as of Thursday. Schools reopened last week in Miami-Dade County, and this week in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. Life is back to normal for most, but not for people like Annette Jackson Forrester, 44, who has been living at the Red Cross shelter at the McNicol Middle School with her husband and 6-year-old grandson. Ms. Jackson Forrester said that her apartment's ceiling had caved in, that the place was moldy because of flooding and that her grandson, an asthmatic with other health problems, could not live there. FEMA cannot inspect her home until Nov. 17, she said, but her patience has run out. ''We need to be in our own place,'' Ms. Jackson Forrester said, starting to cry. ''I'm tired. I'm tired.''"
"This is normally the splendid season at Everglades National Park, when mosquitoes relent (sort of), the humidity lifts and the trails through remote cypress stands and saw grass sloughs become South Florida's finest escape. But little here is normal after Hurricane Wilma's brutal winds and eight-foot storm surge battered the park last month. The storm toppled thousands of trees, wiped out backcountry campsites and flooded the park's lone hotel so badly that it will remain closed through next year. The flooding from Florida Bay left boat launching sites, boardwalks and visitor centers caked with mud so stubborn it had to be power-washed away. It tipped trams and houseboats, wrecked housing for park employees and left a coating of slimy algae on a loop road loved by bikers and alligators. Many surviving trees lost leaves or turned brown, making the subtropical landscape look more like a place where the temperature would never reach 90 degrees in November. ''It reminds me of being up north,'' said Rick Cook, a spokesman for the park for 11 years. ''I've never seen the trees bare like this.'' Hurricanes can bring some benefits for nature, and the Everglades, a vast expanse of low-lying marshland enjoyed by birds and reptiles, is particularly well adapted to surviving them. The storm flushed sediment out of Florida Bay, killed harmful exotic trees and gave native species a chance to grow faster by thinning the tree canopy and letting sunlight in. The destruction was minor compared with the damage done by past storms, like Hurricane Donna in 1960, which killed far more vegetation and wading birds. ''It's pruned a little but really isn't all that different,'' Craig Smith, the park's chief botanist, said of the landscape. ''Things don't get big down here because they get pruned by storm after storm after storm.'' Still, Mr. Smith said, it will probably take a decade for the park to look the way it once did. The storm might have made it easier for some nonnative trees and plants to spread and destroyed roosting areas for birds. Unlike Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which wreaked havoc on the headquarters, main visitor center and adjacent boardwalks on the park's eastern side, Hurricane Wilma pounded the Flamingo area at the park's southern tip, a former hunting and fishing outpost that is now a bird-watching haven and starting point for canoe trips. Flamingo is one of the only spots in the world where crocodiles and alligators coexist. And until recently, it was the only place in the park where visitors could sleep in a hotel room -- at the 1950's-era Flamingo Lodge, 38 miles down a lonely road from the main entrance -- instead of in a tent. The park also suffered damage from Hurricane Katrina, and workers were still cleaning up from that storm when Hurricane Wilma hit on Oct. 24. After both storms, crews from national parks around the country traveled to South Florida to help gather and remove the debris blocking roads, trails and waterways. One recent afternoon, a crew from Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona made up of Navajo Indians, some of whom had never before left home, said they were amazed by the flatness of the Everglades and by its slithering wildlife. ''Our first week here we saw a nine-foot python,'' said Harris Hardy, who was piling dead branches from coco plum and wax myrtle trees near Flamingo. ''One of our guys was sawing in a tree and it was laying right there.'' More than 150 pythons have been spotted in the park in the last two years, presumably abandoned pets or their descendants, park rangers said, including one that tried in vain to swallow an alligator earlier this year. The park is home to more than two dozen other snake species, as well as wild pigs, endangered Florida panthers and myriad swooping, jewel-colored birds. Most wildlife apparently survived the storm, Mr. Cook said. In fact, the birds at Flamingo got to feast for days on fish that had been swept from Florida Bay into tidal pools created by the storm surge. Though it first appeared that the park would be closed indefinitely, some areas have recovered quickly. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center in Everglades City, at the northwest point of the park, reopened on Nov. 3, the main visitor center near Florida City on Nov. 11 and the Shark Valley Visitor Center, home of the loop road along the park's northern border, on Nov. 12. Visitors can travel about halfway down the road to Flamingo from Florida City but will have to wait at least another week or two to glimpse Flamingo again. And the wait for backcountry camping -- at isolated sites that include chickees, or raised wooden platforms with roofs over swamps -- will be longer because so many chickees were damaged. The park usually grants about 30,000 backcountry camping permits a year, with the busiest season lasting from Christmas through February. While the park may be less visited this year and its landscape less vivid, Mr. Cook said, felled trees and temporary flooding are far preferable to other problems: the invasion of exotic species and the disruption of the natural flow of water to the Everglades to aid farming and development farther north. ''If trees go down, it's fine as long as the reason is a naturally caused one,'' Mr. Cook said. ''Our real concern is altered water flow from upstream, and hurricanes don't change that one way or another.'' Everglades Journal"
"WHEN I saw that photo of a little boy sitting in the Houston Astrodome after Hurricane Katrina, eating a doughnut and drinking milk from a carton, looking sad and scared, it all came back to me. Fifty years ago, I was much like that child. It was the summer of 1955, and I was 11 years old. Rain from Hurricanes Connie and Diane had poured steadily for several days on Dutchess County. One night, firefighters knocked on the door of our house in Pleasant Valley and ordered us to evacuate to a shelter being set up in nearby Poughkeepsie. My parents, my baby brother, my two younger sisters and I piled into our Hudson sedan. I was just about to complain that my sister Melanie was taking up too much space in the back seat when I heard a deafening roar. The car spun around and was thrown on its side and then pushed back upright again by roaring waters cluttered with bushes and upended trees, shutters from houses and animals, including a bellowing cow. My mother grabbed my 18-month-old brother, Glenn, and my father grabbed me. Our next-door neighbors and my grandfather, who were in the car ahead of us, grabbed my two sisters. Together we made it to higher ground. After straggling along the road for a while, we came to a house and woke the inhabitants, who reluctantly took us in. Cold, wet and frightened, the nine of us watched the waters rise over several days as our hosts ran out of food and water. Even as the water began to subside, there was no way out because the roads had been washed away. It was another several days before we could try to find help, and by then we were hungry, dirty and very scared. When the emergency workers arrived, bearing doughnuts and coffee, the residents of Pleasant Valley were not pleased. We didn't want doughnuts. We needed diapers, medicine, real food and water. Just like the Hurricane Katrina victims, the Dutchess County flood victims were furious at the slow and inept efforts by federal, state and local authorities. Almost a half-century later, timely, effective and equitable rescue and recovery remain the subject of debate. Hurricane Rita has underscored the need for local governments to prepare collectively to fend for themselves in an emergency. And that's exactly what some northern Westchester communities are doing. Lewisboro has joined with Bedford, Pound Ridge and Somers to create an informal resource- sharing network. On Oct. 29, we held a disaster ''tabletop'' drill in Bedford Hills, where we evaluated the towns' abilities to communicate and work together. This is a step in the right direction, but more is needed. Each town must create a group of at least 30 trained volunteers who will be ready, willing and able to step forward to assist their neighbors during a catastrophe and for at least a week after an emergency. They must develop and coordinate evacuation plans with staggered schedules and assigned routes. Every school district and fire department should dedicate a closet or storage room to blankets, nonperishable food, medicines and other standard emergency relief supplies, all of which should be checked every three months. A trailer that could be moved to wherever the need is greatest is vital to every town's emergency relief plans. Perhaps civic groups, professional organizations and local businesses could be urged to underwrite the cost of the trailer, since taxpayers are often loath to pay for what may seem like a mere amenity, particularly when the sun is shining. If local officials do not act now, it may be our own children with a doughnut, a milk container and haunted eyes looking out at us from Web sites and newspapers. But, of course, that's only if they are among the survivors. Op-Ed Contributor Jessica Bacal, a lawyer in private practice, is a Lewisboro councilwoman and head of the town's emergency planning task force."
"After Hurricane Katrina floored this city, there was widespread hope that Mardi Gras would yank New Orleans back to its feet, helping to reclaim its spirit, its tourists and its economy. The two weeks of Mardi Gras parades and parties have for decades been the city's binding cord, bringing together all segments of society and thousands of outsiders for a mix of the sacred and the profane. But with planning for the February Carnival season now under way, Mardi Gras has been plagued by harsh financial realities, indecision, lowered expectations and the possibility that this year's parade lineup could be absent some of its most popular krewes, or social clubs. After the city announced plans for smaller and fewer Mardi Gras parades, dissatisfied krewes protested. Responding to the pressure, an advisory panel to Mayor C. Ray Nagin recommended Wednesday that an additional weekend be included in an abbreviated Mardi Gras parade season. The mayor is expected to agree to a pre-Lenten Carnival season of eight days, instead of the customary 12, culminating Feb. 28 on Mardi Gras Day (known in English as Fat Tuesday). Yet while city officials and merchants are desperate for symbols of recovery and renewal, some residents are concerned about the message that will be projected when New Orleans holds a giant party in a hurricane's catastrophic wake. The coming Mardi Gras will celebrate 150 years of New Orleans's parade tradition and, officials hope, provide a fiscal bloody mary for a hung-over economy that has suffered a shutdown of vital tourism and a layoff of half of the municipal work force. Mardi Gras pumps $1 billion directly and indirectly into the local economy each year, the equivalent of several Super Bowls, city officials say. While Carnival is intended to signal that New Orleans is open for business again, residents say they also need the celebration for themselves, to affirm the city's essence -- a piquant improvisation evident in the food, music, irreverence and self-indulgence. ''If not one tourist comes to town, Mardi Gras will still serve its initial purpose -- entertaining local people,'' said Ed Muniz, founder and captain of the Krewe of Endymion, which holds one of the largest and most lavish Mardi Gras parades. ''I think the locals need a celebration of life. The funeral has got to end, and the recovery has got to begin.'' City and Mardi Gras officials say they are confident that the 2006 Carnival season can be of high quality. But several issues, mostly financial, remain unresolved. At a tense planning meeting on Monday, Warren J. Riley, the acting police superintendent, said his department welcomed Mardi Gras, understood its social and financial importance and could provide adequate protection for paradegoers. But Superintendent Riley also said there was no money budgeted to pay overtime to New Orleans's 1,442 police officers. All parades will have to follow one route, down St. Charles Avenue, and each day's parading can last no longer than eight hours, he said. ''We do not have $5 for overtime,'' Superintendent Riley said, explaining that such costs ran as high as $300,000 to $400,000 on weekends during Mardi Gras. The city reconsidered that position on Wednesday, saying it was seeking to raise an additional $1.5 million to extend Mardi Gras over two weekends and to pay for overtime on several days. Krewes have agreed to relax a prohibition on corporate sponsorship of Mardi Gras, but say they will not allow corporate logos on floats. Wednesday's recommendation came after warnings by krewes that 10 parades might be canceled or moved. Mr. Muniz, the Endymion captain, said Monday that plans to trim Mardi Gras were sending a message to tourists ''not to come.'' He threatened to move his parade to adjacent Jefferson Parish. ''I want to be in New Orleans, but if I've got to cut my parade in half, I'm not going to parade in New Orleans,'' said Mr. Muniz, whose krewe has 2,300 members. On Wednesday, Mr. Muniz said he felt assured that overtime money would be raised to accommodate his parade in full. The Krewe of Zulu, established in 1909 and representing a cross section of African-American society, will decide on Dec. 4 whether to participate in the coming Mardi Gras. Many of the krewe's 500-plus members lived in the heavily damaged New Orleans East section and remain out of town and out of contact, said Andrew Pete Sanchez, the club's chairman of Carnival activities. ''The feeling is mixed,'' Mr. Sanchez said. ''Those who have returned home support participation. Those in opposition want to be able to come home first.'' The decorated coconuts thrown by Zulu's members are among the most distinctive and sought-after Mardi Gras trinkets. ''There's no Mardi Gras without Zulu,'' said Arthur Hardy, a Carnival historian and publisher of a definitive Mardi Gras guide. ''They're just too much part of the celebration.'' Among other possible casualties are the Mardi Gras Indians, African-Americans who dress in elaborately feathered costumes in honor of Indians who helped runaway slaves. The Mardi Gras Indians celebrate with theatrical confrontations among ''tribes,'' but some find themselves short of the material and thousands of dollars needed to make their costumes, said Alfred Doucette, big chief of the Flaming Arrows tribe. ''I don't have no more supplies,'' Mr. Doucette said. ''I need feathers and stuff.'' His costumes require 10 pounds of ostrich feathers that cost about $5 apiece, Mr. Doucette, a singer, said, explaining that it had been difficult to find work as a musician since Hurricane Katrina struck in August. Speaking of other chieftains, he said, ''They would like to come, but they're short on money this year.'' If African-American participation is severely curtailed, Mardi Gras may run the risk of further delineating the class and racial divide exposed after the hurricane. No one seriously considered canceling Mardi Gras in 2006. That would have been ''a big blow to the psychology of New Orleanians,'' said Wayne Phillips, curator of costumes and textiles at the Louisiana State Museum here. ''It is not just a frivolous celebration of costumes and beads, but an ingrained part of our psyche.'' Still, locals acknowledge, the approaching Mardi Gras will require a delicate balance that validates a city's spirit without minimizing the devastation and dislocation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. Some said they worried that outsiders might receive conflicting signals from scenes of partying and drinking in a disaster area at a time when New Orleans has its hand out for billions in federal money. ''I have mixed feelings,'' said Barry Barth, a float builder. ''I want my business to go on, but I don't think the rest of the country understands Mardi Gras. I'm concerned they're going to see it as a waste of money instead of New Orleans coming back. Or they may say, 'These guys don't look like they're that bad off.' '' City and Mardi Gras officials point to a study indicating that the 2000 Carnival season generated $55 million in tax revenue for local, parish and state governments, including $21 million for New Orleans itself, a nearly fivefold return on the $4.5 million spent on police, sanitation and emergency services. New Orleans expects to have 22,000 hotel rooms available for tourists in February. Even with a scaled-down Mardi Gras, ''we can't afford not to do it,'' said Blaine Kern, the city's largest float builder, who is known as Mr. Mardi Gras. If only half of the usual tax revenue is generated, Mr. Kern said, ''that's still something.'' The more satirical krewes are certain to skewer politicians who have been widely criticized for the government response to Hurricane Katrina. According to sketches of the Krewe of Muses parade, its television theme will lampoon Mayor Nagin, who faces re-election in February, as a star in ''The Ex Files'' and ''Sixty Feet Under.'' The canine Krewe of Barkus will celebrate animals rescued after the hurricane and is exploring the theme of ''A Street Dog Named Desire.'' About 700 dogs are expected in the parade, along with a tabby cat, several ferrets and a goat. As usual, the queen will arrive by riverboat to be greeted by a king awaiting with Champagne and a gift, perhaps a rhinestone-encrusted paw-print brooch. ''All this will be forgotten when the first float rolls,'' Mr. Hardy, the Mardi Gras historian, said of the current crisis. ''The story is not that New Orleans will have a smaller Mardi Gras, but that it can do Mardi Gras at all.''"
"The Louisiana Attorney General said Tuesday that he had begun examining why the New Orleans levees failed during Hurricane Katrina, partly to increase the chances that people who lost their homes will be compensated for their losses. Attorney General Charles C. Foti Jr. said in an interview that his review could lead to a civil suit to prove that levee design or construction errors caused the flood damage. A favorable ruling in such a lawsuit could make it easier for those with heavy losses to collect damages from engineering firms and construction companies found negligent in the construction of the levee Mr. Foti said he also would examine whether shoddy workmanship contributed to the levee failures, leading to a possible criminal investigation if any evidence of that surfaced. Last week, an engineering expert told a Congressional panel that malfeasance might have led to the levee failures, based on statements -- still vague and uncorroborated -- from a few former levee workers and their families. The Orleans Parish district attorney, Eddie Jordan, also has opened an inquiry. At a minimum, Mr. Foti's effort, first reported in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, represents an attempt to protect homeowners, many of whom were angry to learn that their insurance companies would not compensate them for flood damage. The effort also could help push the inquiries into the levee failures beyond the engineering world and into law enforcement. ''There have been plenty of allegations about everything, O.K., including that poor design of the retaining walls was the proximate cause of the flooding,'' Mr. Foti said. Given the potential for significant insurance disputes, he said, his aim was to help clarify ''what the law is -- and what the rights of consumers and homeowners are.'' Mr. Foti's inquiry comes amid mounting evidence that basic design flaws contributed to the collapse of some of the earthen levees and concrete retaining walls in New Orleans and other areas. Independent engineers have said that pockets of weak soil and shallow steel anchors helped set off the failures in the flood walls, which let water pour into the main parts of the city. Huge earthen levees in neighboring parishes were washed away by storm surges. Officials of the Army Corps of Engineers have said they are still examining why some of the failures occurred. Mr. Foti's aides said they also would work closely with a team of scientists and engineers from the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, which has been looking into the levee breaks. Ivor van Heerden, the deputy director of the Hurricane Center, said Tuesday that his group had received a $90,000 grant from the state Transportation and Development department to dig more deeply into the failures. Corps officials have said the steel pilings were driven to 17 feet below sea level on the 17th Street Canal, although Dr. van Heerden said some documents suggested that they went down only 10 feet. Soil tests show that a layer of very weak peat soil stretched about 10 to 15 feet below sea level in the area where the breach occurred. The Corps has released only a limited number of documents. Dr. van Heerden said other records, collected from state archives, suggest that some of the steel pilings ''may not have been in very good shape.'' They also indicate that long sections of the pilings might have been removed at one point and then driven back in, adding to the weakness in the soil. The accusations of corruption surfaced when an engineering professor, Raymond Seed, told a Senate committee last week that in addition to possible design errors, ''There may have been malfeasance.'' Dr. Seed, who led an outside team examining the levee failures, said after the hearing that the team had been contacted by the widows of levee workers and contractors who told stories of pilings being driven less deeply than planned and sand and shells being substituted for stronger soil. He cautioned that the statements had not been verified and might not prove to be significant. Dr. van Heerden said that even though his group had published a hot line number, it had received only one more general complaint about shoddy workmanship."
"All over New Orleans, from brick apartment complexes in the east to crumbling stucco low-rises in the center, constables have been busy tacking eviction notices to often-empty apartments. Landlords, many of them starved for rent and fearing foreclosure, have been trying to evict tenants that escaped New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. And that has pitted landlords against jobless and cash-poor tenants in a fierce race for survival that began playing out Thursday in the city's only functional civil courthouse. Many tenants either cannot pay rent or cannot get home -- no small matter in a city where low-income renters are in the majority. And with as much as a fifth of the rental stock destroyed, demand is high and surviving apartment complexes have waiting lists. That creates a dangling temptation for landlords who think they might now make more money. After a moratorium on evictions imposed by Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco expired 10 days ago, the landlords in the city filed nearly 700 eviction notices. In some cases, they logged as many notices in a single day as court clerks usually see in a whole month. The resulting struggles were on full view Thursday in the old Algiers courthouse across the Mississippi River from downtown as the first formal eviction hearings began. Tenants complained that the broken-down post office -- which is just getting around to delivering mail from late August -- had failed to deliver their paychecks, or they accused landlords of being money-hungry. Property owners, for their part, said they needed rental income to make their mortgage payments; some claimed their buildings were so damaged that all leases were void. At most of the hearings, the tenants did not show up, a testimony to the city's emptiness. And some of those who did trek to the turreted little 19th-century courthouse did not get good news from the judge. Robert Wells, a construction worker and part-time French Quarter waiter, was given 48 hours to clear out of his basement apartment in the Algiers Point neighborhood after failing to pay his October or November rent of $525. He insisted his family was sending him money, and muttered afterward that his landlord was ''price gouging.'' During Mr. Wells's hearing, Judge Mary Norman of City Court pointedly noted that the landlord, Tony Carter, would have a long waiting list of tenants if the eviction were successful. But she also asked for commentary about Mr. Wells from the assembled landlords sitting in the courtroom, and one of them called out, ''Your Honor, he would not be considered a good tenant.'' Afterward, Mr. Carter acknowledged that someone else was waiting for the apartment, but he insisted: ''I'm not looking to gouge anybody. I've lost 90 percent of my tenants.'' Housing experts say many landlords here are not trying to gouge. ''It's a real conundrum,'' said James Perry of the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center. ''The landlords make their money off renters, and renters, not unreasonably, object to paying rent when they are not even there.'' The laggard mail and New Orleans' chronically dysfunctional public housing authority -- a big source of rent for private landlords here through subsidized Section 8 vouchers -- were often cited Thursday as culprits, but that was of little help to tenants. Catina Holmes, a mother of two with a third on the way, said her paycheck from the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office, where she worked in the parish jail, had never arrived. ''They had our checks tied up since God knows when,'' Ms. Holmes said. ''These landlords are just being ridiculous. They're not being sensible.'' But Ms. Holmes was ordered out of her apartment as of Monday morning unless she comes up with her share of the rent by Sunday. In the courtroom, Judge Norman gave evicted tenants the telephone numbers for the Salvation Army, Covenant House and other shelters. ''No one left here today being put out on the street,'' she said afterward in an interview in her office overlooking the river. ''That is my goal as a judge.'' She added, ''Some people even tease me, and call me the social service judge.'' STORM AND CRISIS: HOUSING"
"IF you were visiting Sanibel and Captiva Islands for the first time, you would see no evidence that they were still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Charley, which hit this part of Florida hard in August 2004. Debris has been cleaned up and buildings newly roofed. The islands' white sand beaches, famous for their extraordinary crops of seashells, ring interiors of sturdy-looking palms, sea grapes, cactuses and wild grasses. Gnarly mangroves in swamps and lagoons camouflage the usual alligators, blubbery manatees, river otters, bobcats, loping turtles and abundant waterfowl. Longtime lovers of these islands, however, miss the cathedral-like canopy of Australian pines that Charley's winds spirited away. Periwinkle Way, the main street in Sanibel, was lined with 40-foot-tall evergreens before Charley hit. Hollie Smith, owner of the Sanibel Island Bookshop on Periwinkle, takes a philosophical approach to this fundamental change in the look and feel of the island. ''It looks more island-y,'' she said. ''You can see the native vegetation better.'' The real estate market is vibrant despite the effects of the hurricane and increasingly strict building codes intended to cut down on storm damage. Trevor Nette, a broker associate with Coldwell Banker Previews International, said the buyers vary from couples in their 60's looking for retirement homes to young families with new earning power looking for a leisure-time getaway. ''Buyers are getting younger and younger,'' Mr. Nette said. Many owners rent out their places for weeks or months a year as a way of subsidizing their own vacation time on Sanibel. Ten years ago, it was tough for Kevin Stevenson, who lives in Hillsdale, Ind., and was then 38, and his wife, Diane, 25 at the time, to scrape together, with his brother and parents, the down payment on a $235,000, two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit at Loggerhead Cay, a condominium community on Sanibel. But after vacationing all over Florida, Mr. Stevenson had fallen in love with Sanibel's natural beauty and beaches. Now he and his extended family spend as much time there as they can, in a collection of properties that has now grown to three condos and a house. They sold their first Sanibel condominium in 1999 for $385,000, and Mr. Stevenson has since bought and sold several Sanibel and Captiva properties. Among those the family owns is a four-bedroom, four-bathroom house with a heated pool on Captiva, bought for $1.15 million in January. ''Everything we've touched here has turned to gold,'' Mr. Stevenson said. The Scene Accessible by a single causeway from Fort Myers, Sanibel and Captiva are two separate islands connected by a bridge. Sanibel is closer to the mainland. Captiva, less than five miles long and barely half a mile wide, has homes close together yet is postcard-pretty, with a kind of Margaritaville quality to the small bars and restaurants around the main intersection. It has modest new houses and large waterside mansions, mixed in with quaint hotels, motels and cottages painted in bright shades of pink, orange and lilac. The much larger Sanibel, roughly 12 miles long and 5 miles across at its widest, has a more open feeling even though it is extensively developed. Condo complexes and large houses line the Gulf of Mexico beaches, and smaller houses dot the interior. Some waterfront homes on the bay side have private docks. Periwinkle Way is lined with shops, retail strips and restaurants. The atmosphere is conducive to colorful casual dress and flip-flops. A lot of people get around on bicycles. The pace is slow, and it is blissfully quiet most of the time, though school holidays can be busy. Watching the sunset from the beachfront patio of the Mucky Duck restaurant in Captiva is a favorite ritual. Joan Sperry, a housewife from Rehoboth Beach, Del., and her husband, Jim, a retired banker, along with their golden retriever and miniature dachshund, spend six months a year on Sanibel. In June, they bought a cinder-block ranch house after selling another island condo. Before those purchases, they rented for a number of years. Though they live in a beach community up north, they relish the quiet of Sanibel. ''There are no high-rises, no street lights at night and no traffic signals,'' Mrs. Sperry said. ''It doesn't feel like Florida to me.'' Pros Nature and the sea are the local elixirs of choice. Combing the sands for shells at Bowman's Beach, Blind Pass or Sanibel Lighthouse is one way to while away the hours, and a trip to the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum explains just what it is you've picked up. Early mornings are best for hiking, biking or driving in the nearly 6,000 acres of wetlands and interior habitats in the J. N. ''Ding'' Darling National Wildlife Refuge with its reptiles, mammals and colorful birds. Boating and golf are popular. Restaurants abound, and Barrier Island Group for the Arts sponsors cultural events and performances. The islands are art-friendly; the artist Robert Rauschenberg lives year-round on Captiva. Cons The causeway to the mainland turns into a parking lot in the high season. Islanders hope a new bridge opening in 2007 will ease the problem. Traffic on the two-lane road main road can be nightmarish as well. Hurricanes can always return, and insurance rates have skyrocketed since Charley, said Susan Lapham, a paralegal from Delray, Fla. She and her husband, Jerry Shatsky, a real estate broker, make the two-and-a-half-hour drive most weekends to spend time in their condominium in Mariner Pointe, a 100-unit complex on Sanibel. The annual insurance premiums paid by their condominium association doubled, from $54,455 to $124,272, after the hurricane hit. Taxes, too, are going up, making Ms. Lapham question her future on Sanibel. ''Am I going to be able to afford to have a second home there?'' she said. The Real Estate Market Prices are high, but Ken Frey, managing director of Sellstate Sancap Realty, contends that they are reasonable compared to those in some other parts of Florida. ''You can get a single-family, free-standing home on a nice lot, five minutes' walk from the beach, for $749,000,'' he said. Mr. Frey sold two houses earlier this year that had been on the market for about three months each. A 2,500-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom canalside house with a dock and a pool was listed at $899,000 and sold for $890,000. A 1,700-square-foot three-bedroom, two-bathroom house a mile from the beach closed for the list price of $739,000. Condos stay on the market between 120 and 180 days but close at the asking price 95 percent of the time, said Shane Spring, a Realor with Coldwell Banker Previews International. A 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom gulffront unit listed for $1,139,000 sold for $1,075,000 after 133 days on the market, Mr. Spring said, and a 1,512-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit with a view of the gulf was listed at $749,000 and sold for $740,000 after 108 days on the market. Inventory is low, with 77 condos listed, 21 of which are priced at more than $1 million, Mr. Spring said. Of 95 houses listed, 50 are priced at more than $1 million.

Weekly rates are available. A funkier option is the 'Tween Waters Inn (15951 Captiva Drive, Captiva; 800-223-5865), with 137 rooms and suites, some in Victorian-style cottages, for $260 to $690 in the high season.

"THE Jets have a game Sunday night against a team that deserves more sympathy than they do. As even Herman Edwards acknowledged: Homeless trumps quarterbackless in the cold, cruel world of the National Football League. Straining Wednesday to give thanks for something, Edwards, the Jets' coach, reached an existential conclusion. ''With everything that's gone on this year, long as the roof doesn't cave in on us, we're going to be O.K.,'' he said. It's no joking matter, but the Superdome did collapse on the New Orleans Saints, who officially became Hurricane Katrina's poster team when they last visited New Jersey for what the geographically challenged N.F.L. sanctioned as a September home game against the Giants. On the road to nomadic privation, the Saints have compiled the same 2-8 mark as Edwards's bruised, beleaguered Jets. Holiday-engorged America may sleep through Sunday night's game at Giants Stadium, but at least someone is going to get a much-deserved break in what Edwards called a match between ''two teams that are starving to win a game.'' For the sake of Edwards, a standup guy, as approachable a football coach as we know, this would be a most opportune time for the Jets to rally round the leader they claim to love, huddle up and shout: ''Not in our house.'' Or at least in the house they borrow from the Giants, playing to their own sense of permanent guesthood. Even after the Jets were outscored by a breathtaking 57-3 in their last two games, at Carolina and at Denver, there has been, over all, a willingness to attribute their collapse from supposed Super Bowl contention to a general health epidemic, a huge conspiracy of fate. ''Look at the teams that even lose their quarterback for a week or two,'' Edwards said Wednesday at the Jets' bunker in Hempstead, N.Y. ''Look how they struggle. Look at Pittsburgh. Maybe you can survive in this league when you lose one quarterback. But two quarterbacks, plus key people on your offensive line?'' Edwards raised his eyebrows, shook his head. ''People who understand football know what we're going through,'' he said. At Carolina, yes; at Denver, no doubt. But in the fickle court of public opinion, there is typically a fine line between pitiable and pitiful, and the Jets run a real risk of crossing it Sunday night -- be it with Brooks Bollinger at quarterback or Garth Brooks. Get blown out by the Saints, and the ground could shift under the feet of Edwards and the Jets' general manager, Terry Bradway. Reasonable explanations could begin to sound like rancid excuses. Bradway's personnel moves -- losing valuable parts like the veteran nose tackle Jason Ferguson and the running back LaMont Jordan -- could be stridently cast as off-season misadventures. Edwards's assiduous capacity to forecast sun could be viewed as outlandishly rose-colored, if not plain ranting. Lose to the homeless at home, and the claim by the owner Woody Johnson that Edwards is ''great for the team'' and his Wednesday pledge to have him return next year may be construed as the dreaded vote of confidence. On the morning he was criticized in a New York newspaper for making himself a moving target last Sunday to reporters wishing to ask about Edwards's future, Johnson took time out from his routine of being fabulously wealthy to straighten out Edwards's employment status. ''Herman's not leaving,'' Johnson said when he magically appeared at practice. ''I don't want him to leave. I've never wanted him to leave.'' Johnson later repeated his mantra to the players, promising ownership support for them and the coach. Edwards certainly has built up enough collateral to withstand this season's disaster, making the playoffs in three of his first four seasons, coming within a kick of playing New England last year for the A.F.C. title when his quarterback, Chad Pennington, had a bum arm. At this point, with Edwards still enjoying popular support, why wouldn't Johnson want him back? But the most recent speculation was more about whether Edwards, given options, would want to return. On that front, Johnson did not promise to hold Edwards to the last two years of his contract if Edwards wished to pursue the expected vacancy in Kansas City next season, nor would he say he would be amenable to further negotiating to discourage him from going. ''We're not going to talk about an extension,'' Johnson said. ''He's got two years left.'' Put yourself in Edwards's shoes, given a hypothetical choice: Return to the Jets after a dismal season, without knowing whom his quarterback is, with no guarantee of long-term employment, or inherit a likely playoff team with a brand-new contract, a fresh start. He has told his players that he won't bail on them. Of course, you could ask, what would the most obvious motivational tactic be in the midst of this mess? For now, there's no place like home, unless the Saints march in, grease the Jets' skid to a 2-14 season and the consensus public support Edwards and Bradway still have devolves into a Rich Kotite Christmas spectacle. It's fair to wonder what Woody -- who apparently will respond when the news media roils -- would have to say then? Sports of The Times Email: hjaraton@nytimes.com"
"Less than three weeks before the official start of the hurricane season, government forecasters on Monday predicted an active season that could be comparable to last year's destructive one. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that 12 to 15 tropical storms will form this year. Of those, 7 to 9 are expected to become hurricanes, and 3 to 5 will become major hurricanes, with winds exceeding 110 miles per hour. ''Forecaster confidence that this will be an active hurricane season is very high,'' the agency's administrator, Vice Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, who is retired from the Navy, said at a news conference in Bay St. Louis, Miss. Agency researchers said the prediction assumed a continuation of the above-average activity that began in 1995. Higher sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, which are conducive to hurricane formation, are also expected this year. William M. Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, made similar predictions last month. Professor Gray forecasted 13 named storms and predicted that 7 would become hurricanes, with 3 becoming major hurricanes. Storms become hurricanes when their winds exceed 73 m.p.h. The most dangerous, a Category 5, has winds greater than 155 m.p.h. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami reminded residents of the importance of being prepared. ''Last year's hurricane season provided a reminder that planning and preparation for a hurricane do make a difference,'' said Max Mayfield, the center's director. ''Residents in hurricane-vulnerable areas who had a plan, and took individual responsibility for acting on those plans, fared far better than those who did not.'' Last year, 9 hurricanes formed out of 15 named storms. Six became major hurricanes and 4 -- Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne -- made landfall in Florida in August and September. By the end of the season, an estimated 25,000 homes had been destroyed in Florida, and an additional 50,000 damaged. But some Floridians still do not take the warnings seriously. Hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30."
"GOVERNMENT forecasters predict that this year's hurricane season, from Wednesday to Nov. 30, will produce as many as nine hurricanes, up to five of which are expected to be major storms. Are you prepared? ''A recent poll of 1,100 people in 12 coastal states found that 47 percent did not have a plan for what to do in a hurricane,'' said Frank Lepore, public affairs director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Mr. Lepore said the best way to prepare for a hurricane is to identify a home's vulnerabilities. Homes on Long Island and the Connecticut and New Jersey shorelines are particularly vulnerable to storm surge. ''A storm surge is the water the hurricane is pushing ahead of it,'' Mr. Lepore said, adding that in the case of a Category 5 hurricane, one with winds of more than 155 miles per hour, the storm surge is between 17 and 20 feet. ''If your house is not at an elevation of more than 20 feet, you could have a real problem.'' The primary strategy for people in coastal areas is to have an evacuation plan and a disaster kit. ''You want to make sure you have cash, food and water, essential medicine, gas in the car and an escape route,'' Mr. Lepore said, adding that it is critical to have a destination in mind, preferably a friend or relative's house well outside the danger zone. It is also necessary to prepare the home, whether you plan on leaving or riding out the storm. Wendy Rose, spokeswoman for the Institute for Business and Home Safety, in Tampa, Fla., said that homes within 1,500 feet of open water are most vulnerable in a hurricane. The most susceptible areas are the roof, windows and doors. Ms. Rose said that in some homes, the roof may not be securely connected to the rafters. ''We've seen instances where entire boards haven't been nailed down,'' she said. ''Some roofs are held in place by staples.'' In homes with exposed rafters, the owner can conduct a lift test by pushing up on the undersurface of the roof. If the roof moves, she said, it should be secured by running a bead of construction glue along the joint where the rafter meets the roof and then imbedding a length of quarter-round molding into the glue on both sides of the rafter. It's also advisable, she said, for homeowners in high-risk areas to have 3/4-inch plywood storm shutters precut and ready to attach to permanent stainless steel anchor bolts set into the framing of the house. ''People who nail up plywood at the last minute often don't fasten it safely and the plywood ends up being airborne debris,'' she said. To protect a home against wind-driven rain, homeowners should apply silicone caulk around outside wall openings like kitchen or bathroom vents and where cables or pipes go through walls. When a storm warning is issued, she said, windows, doors and skylights should be locked, and gable end-vents should be sealed to prevent rain from entering the attic. Lawn furniture and other outdoor objects should be stored indoors. Jean Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute in Manhattan, said homeowners in areas at risk for hurricane damage should ensure that they have adequate insurance coverage. In recent years, she said, carriers have added hurricane deductibles of 1 to 15 percent of the home's insured value. ''You should know what your deductible is ahead of time,'' she said, noting that since different carriers may have different deductibles and different triggers for those deductibles, with the trigger generally tied to the severity of the storm, it may be wise to shop around. Since flooding is not covered by most homeowner policies, she said, flood insurance might be advisable. ''Remember,'' she said, ''there's a 30-day waiting period before a flood insurance policy takes effect.'' YOUR HOME"
"The water began rising in the streets early on Sunday morning as Hurricane Dennis was bearing down on Pensacola, about 200 miles to the west, and no one thought much about it. This village of funky restaurants, marinas and little fishing companies lies between two small rivers just back from the broad, shallow Apalachee Bay, and a little water in the streets is not that unusual, especially in hurricane season. But the muddy water kept coming. And by late Sunday afternoon a boat was needed to get around much of St. Marks. Barstools and beer coolers were floating inside the St. Marks River Cantina, and just the top of Bo Lynn's Grocery and Market was poking out of the dark, eddying water. ''Nobody thought it would be like this,'' Steve Dunbar, a retired certified public accountant from Austin, Tex., who owns the River Cantina, said Monday. The flooding in St. Marks and other towns along the shores of Apalachee Bay and the Gulf Coast stretching toward Pensacola was a surprise to many tracking Hurricane Dennis. The big fear had been that the storm would hammer Pensacola with the same devastating punch that Hurricane Ivan delivered last September. But the real damage seems to have been far from the center of Hurricane Dennis, in little places like St. Marks, which is about 20 miles south of Tallahassee, and neighboring villages like Shell Point and Panacea, where the worst flooding in decades occurred. The flood was short-lived. By Monday the only evidence was a few muddy streets and dozens of soggy houses and shops. Many of the houses stand on stilts. But they were not high enough on Sunday. The 300 or so people of St. Marks lost their electricity along with nearly 300,000 others in the Florida Panhandle, and they were among those making do without power Monday as the skies cleared and sunshine began to bake the town. At the concrete-block town hall in St. Marks, Ethel Jefferson, the municipal clerk, was drying documents and trying to figure out how to use her computer on battery power. Down at the edge of the St. Marks River, at the Riverside Cafe, which specializes in blackened grouper and fresh oysters, Stan West's waitresses and cooks were hosing down the picnic tables and wooden counters. ''We put everything up on cement blocks like we normally do for a good high tide,'' Mr. West said, ''but it came way over what we thought.'' For many of those harmed here and elsewhere along the coast, recovery will be quick, but it is going to take a lot of money to replace cars and equipment and furniture ruined by the water. And no one is quite sure where the money is going to come from. Many people in St. Marks had little or no insurance, and no one is sure how much help they will get from the government. Estimates of overall damage in the Panhandle range from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, much less than the toll from Hurricane Ivan. No one died or was seriously injured in the flooding, but there were some close calls. Col. Julie Jones, the head of the State Fish and Wildlife Commission's division of law enforcement, which helps with search and rescue missions during hurricanes, said that at one point, the town of Carabelle, about 35 miles southwest of here, had become an island. Emergency workers received dozens of calls from people trapped in their homes, officials said, and boats had to be used for rescues. Tom Clore, the chief of the St. Marks volunteer fire department, said that boat crews plucked at least a dozen people from water-filled houses here, including a family of six. The coastal destruction, especially along Apalachee Bay, had a lot to do with geography and chance. Hurricane Dennis churned up the Gulf of Mexico from Key West for more than 12 hours, steadily gaining momentum. All the while, said Ben Nelson, Florida's chief meteorologist, it was pushing a rising wall of surface water. As the hurricane's outer winds skimmed Apalachee Bay, which is no more than 5 to 10 feet deep even a few miles offshore, it lifted the water higher. And the cone-shaped coastline of the bay acted like a funnel with one end aimed at St. Marks and other coastal towns. To make matters worse, heavy rain swelled the St. Marks and Wakulla Rivers. ''You had rainwater coming down meeting tidewaters, and there wasn't any place for it to go,'' said John Jefferson, a volunteer firefighter. Mr. Nelson said forecasters had predicted a storm surge of as much as eight feet. But Mr. Clore said the water rose to 10 feet in some parts of St. Marks. At one point on Sunday, Joanna Johnson Cushing, 62, and her husband, Clyde Cushing, 52, thought they might die in their yellow clapboard bungalow. ''We were preparing to leave,'' Mrs. Cushing said. ''But when we started out, the water was already up to my chest.'' They waded to their van. It cranked up, but stalled. They telephoned a friend with a high-wheel truck. He arrived as the water was lapping at their windowsills. But the panicky moments of Sunday were already fading on Monday. No one, including the Cushings, was talking about giving up on a town that may be every bit as quirky as old Key West and, to the delight of the residents, quite a bit smaller. The businesspeople said they were just eager to get back to the quiet way things usually are here. ''We'll be selling beer tomorrow or the next day,'' said Mr. Dunbar at the River Cantina. ''And the kitchen will be back in 10 days to 2 weeks.''"
"The small towns are worn, like the pocket of a catcher's mitt that is the Gulf of Mexico, where bad storms slap to a stop. The day after Hurricane Dennis came and swiftly went, people hurried home just as quickly, from the couches of Alabama relatives and Georgia in-laws. They found, in most cases, their property strewn with branches and leaves, but blessedly whole. Early analyses of the damage indicated that Hurricane Dennis was bad, but nothing like Hurricane Ivan last year, which directly or indirectly killed 57 people in the United States. Hurricane Dennis's peak winds of 145 miles an hour in the gulf, putting it squarely in frightening Category 4 territory, had weakened to 120 m.p.h. by the time it reached shore Sunday afternoon, and the storm sped through a relatively deserted Pensacola and nearby beach towns without reports of serious injury or death. Elsewhere, a 3-year-old boy was killed in DeFuniak Springs in the central Panhandle when he was run over by his father's car as the family prepared to evacuate; a man was electrocuted by a fallen power line in Fort Lauderdale and a man in Georgia was killed by a falling tree, The Associated Press reported. The cleanup will take months, officials said Monday, and Hurricane Dennis should never be discounted as a small storm. ''It didn't fizzle out,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said at a news conference. Or, as Danny Hood, 55, a retiree enjoying his first afternoon of freedom after being trapped in his home by a fallen tree, said in a restaurant here in Milton, east of Pensacola. ''One hundred twenty miles per hour is a pretty good fizzle.'' In some places, Hurricane Dennis inflicted more wind damage than Hurricane Ivan, like in Santa Rosa County, east of Pensacola. The towns of Milton, population 7,025, Bagdad and Pace were on the dangerous northeast edge of the eye wall, and the wind damage exceeded that seen at Pensacola. Monday brought the familiar sights of National Guard convoys chugging down two-lane roads, and insurance companies erecting catastrophe centers in strip mall parking lots. Arnold and Peggy Skipper moved into their east Milton home in 1972 and watched two eight-foot-tall live oaks grow into towering trees that shaded their backyard and its pond stocked with koi. ''Used to be, you could walk in my backyard and you had to hunt a place to get in the sun,'' Mr. Skipper, 57, a supervisor at Air Products and Chemicals in Pace. One tree fell on the house during Hurricane Ivan, denting the roof and collapsing part of the ceiling of the master bedroom. They fixed the roof, only to have the second tree crash through it on Sunday, into the living room and part of the kitchen. When Mr. Skipper stepped under the big trunk and through his back door on Monday, he had to stoop, as if visiting a child's tree house. The living room roof bowed down over shelves of Reader's Digest Best Loved Books and their big-screen TV and knocked the glass out of the grandfather clock. Their wedding pictures were soggy from the rain, and the master bedroom was ruined again. ''Life and health are all that's important,'' Mrs. Skipper said, sitting on her porch as men with chainsaws dissected the tree. She apologized as she fought back tears, and said, ''It's so hard, on top of just getting over the other one, getting torn up again.'' In Reggie's restaurant, with food and air-conditioning powered by a generator, William H. Byrom, 77, a former mayor of Milton who is known as Cotton, said the winds of Hurricane Dennis were worse here than Hurricane Ivan's. ''Last year it pushed the water in here and flooded everything,'' Mr. Byrom said. This time, the winds were able to shear off the left side of a Waffle House restaurant, a chain popular in many gulf towns for being the last to close -- if they close at all -- during a hurricane. A helicopter tour of Navarre Beach, Fla., close to where the storm made landfall, told a similar story, with a restaurant caved in, the dining tables visible from the sky. A seaside bar's tiki roof was nowhere to be seen. Two 20-story construction cranes had fallen away from a towering hotel complex like pieces of an old skin. In Florida, 22 general shelters were still open Monday afternoon, with 3,969 people staying there, and 273,000 people in 28 counties still had no power. Parts of Georgia had flooding after receiving six to eight inches of rain in 24 hours; about 400 homes in two south Georgia counties were evacuated as a precaution, The A.P. reported. In Alabama, where there was minor damage, things returned to normal more quickly. In Gulf Shores, workers rehung traffic lights, not because they had been knocked down, but because they had been taken down before the storm came in. A spokesman for Gov. Bob Riley, Jeff Emerson, defended the decision late Friday to order the mandatory evacuation of Mobile County, where some residents ended up not even losing power, and part of Baldwin County. ''You can't wait until the very end; obviously, hurricanes are unpredictable, as we say,'' Mr. Emerson said. Mobile, Escambia and Baldwin Counties had about 23,000 homes and businesses without power on Monday, and officials said most would have power restored by Tuesday. In Louisiana and Mississippi, no significant storm damage or injuries were reported. Federal and independent storm forecasters have predicted that 2005, like last year, is likely to have a busy Atlantic hurricane season, in part because of warmer ocean waters resulting from a temperature cycle several decades long. But no one predicted that the relatively quiescent months of June and July would have so many named tropical storms so far. The fifth one, Emily, became a tropical storm Monday night in the Atlantic Ocean. The early season burst of storms was probably caused by an unusual early and extra warming of the tropical Atlantic, said James B. Elsner, a meteorologist at Florida State University. ''When you add that additional warmth over and above what's already there, you have a recipe for an early season start,'' Dr. Elsner said. Whatever the cause of the current conditions in the Atlantic, he said, the situation portends a violent second half of the season. In Milton, Mr. Hood, helping his son take down lumber from the windows of their shop, was already casting a wary eye at the latest storm, 2,500 miles away. ''We just got done taking the boards off, but he left them laying there,'' he said. ''He said, 'We might just have to put them right back up.'''"
"The outer rings of Hurricane Emily lashed the shore of the Yucatán late tonight with gusts of wind surging above 90 miles per hour and waves more than six feet high, forcing tourists and local residents from Cancún to Tulum to scramble for shelter. At 11 p.m., Emily's eye was churning through the warm waters about 50 miles south-southeast of Cozumel and moving toward the coast at 18 miles per hour, according to Mexican authorities. The storm's center wall, with sustained winds of 135 miles per hour, was expected to make landfall sometime in the early morning, between 1 and 2 a.m., authorities said. The howling winds had yet to knock down many trees, but the storm had knocked out electricity and running water to many parts of Cancún and Puerto del Carmen, authorities said. In Tulum, the storm surge came right up to the first floors of some beachside hotels, according to radio reports. Rising waters also forced firefighters to evacuate more than 1,000 people from Puerto Juárez, a fishing and tour boat port on the north side of Cancún, Mayor Francisco Alor said. Throughout the day, people up and down the coast, from the tourist hotels in Cancún to the capital in Chetumal, braced for the storm, which many expected to be as bad as Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. As the sky darkened and the winds rose Sunday afternoon in Tulum, Isaac Ventura contemplated the last giant storm to chew through the Yucatán. ''We already had the experience of Gilbert,'' said Mr. Ventura, a propane salesman, as he readied his shop for the worst. ''We know how to manage things. That was terrible. I was stuck in a house five streets from the beach and the winds shook the walls. It seemed as if the world was going to end.'' Though the winds close to its center dropped slightly from 145 miles an hour this afternoon, Hurricane Emily was still a Category 4 monster, spreading wind and rain as far north as the eastern tip of Cuba and as far south as Belize. ''It's still going to be a powerful hurricane when it hits the coast,'' said Richard Pasch, a hurricane expert at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The last storm to maul the Yucatán was Roxanne in 1995, but it did little damage compared to Gilbert, one of the worst storms ever recorded. It killed 327 people. Early this morning, Mexican authorities evacuated tens of thousands of tourists from the main hotel strip in Cancún and emptied the Islas Mujeres and the island of Cozumel on Sunday night. At least 4,000 tourists were taken to public shelters while several thousand others bedded down in 32 hotel lobbies for the night, city authorities said. Hundreds of mostly foreign tourists lay shoulder to shoulder on thin foam pads in a sweltering gymnasium near the center of Cancún, authorities said. Thousands of Mexican residents in flimsy wooden houses were encouraged to go to schools and government buildings set up as temporary shelters, though many refused, going instead to the houses of friends. Authorities estimated that at least 120,000 people had been moved into temporary shelters by late last night. Thousands of tourists whose vacations had been cut short thronged the Cancún International Airport on Sunday morning, waiting for hours in lines in hopes of catching a flight home. By early evening, when the airport was closed, more than 5,000 were still stranded and were being bused to shelters, the Mexican authorities said over the radio. Kevin Lynch, a 34-year-old museum curator from Charlotte, N.C., said he had come to Cancún with five friends to celebrate the impending end of his bacherlorhood. Only four managed to get tickets home, and Mr. Lynch said they would all stay through the storm if the fifth was stranded, though he did not know where. ''We will have to figure it out at the hotel,'' he said, looking helplessly around. ''There is no real way to find out.'' In the poorer neighborhoods of Tulum, many people seemed to have very little more than a prayer to protect them. A car with loudspeakers atop it and a sign saying ''El Huracán,'' roamed the streets, urging people to go to one of two schools providing shelter. One family who lived in a house of wood sticks was going next door to stay with relatives, who have concrete walls. ''Our house will never survive if the eye passes here,'' said María _ngulo Canul, 39. Fernando Villa, 72, sat in his tiny wooden hut, feeling, he said, helpless. He too had barely lived through Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, yet he did not know where to go for shelter. ''I have to find out where it is possible to go,'' he said, grinning. ''Because I have to get out of here.''"
"Hoping to avoid the delays that bedeviled recovery efforts after Florida was hit by four major hurricanes last year, Gov. Jeb Bush ordered 2,600 National Guard troops and 700 law enforcement officers to staging areas just beyond the path of Hurricane Dennis on Sunday, with instructions to move into ravaged areas as soon as the winds eased. State and federal authorities also stockpiled water, ice, food and building materials to be sent to the Panhandle immediately, Governor Bush said, and private relief organizations like the American Red Cross were preparing to help. Utility crews were also standing by, anticipating the widespread loss of electricity, aides to Governor Bush said. Last year, the impact of four hurricanes within six weeks was simply overwhelming, officials said. Dozens of people were killed, and about 3.5 million Floridians lost electricity as power lines were ripped down by trees and by flying metal and glass. State officials said power was restored to most residents in less than two weeks. But some people endured life in the dark for much longer. Many struggled to get food, water, ice and temporary shelter. The enormousness of the destruction resulted in more reconstruction work than building companies could handle. Colleen Castille, the state secretary of environmental protection, said lessons learned after last year's storms had changed response plans this year. Last year, utility crews were unable to get into Pensacola immediately after Hurricane Ivan struck because of heavy damage to two bridges east of the city. This year, Ms. Castille said, utility crews are being readied here in Tallahassee, about 175 miles east of Pensacola, as well as in New Orleans, about 165 miles to the west. For the first time, Ms. Castille said, crews will have maps pinpointing their first priorities, like hospitals, police and fire stations, and other emergency facilities. And, she said, the maps will include details about which power lines and substations feed into those facilities. Governor Bush said that he had spoken with his brother, President Bush, and that state officials had begun drafting a disaster declaration that would open the gates for federal assistance. ''We learned there are some core services or functions that we need to provide people right after the storm,'' Governor Bush said at the state's emergency operations center here, where scores of state and federal officials monitored the storm's progress. Governor Bush said he was already thinking about the aftermath. ''Our focus today is on what we're going to be doing tomorrow, what tomorrow is going to look like,'' he said. ''Convoys of National Guard men and women are going to be heading west, and 700 police officers are going to be doing exactly the same thing.'' By early Sunday afternoon, about 700 National Guard soldiers were preparing to board trucks at the Leon County Fairgrounds on the southern edge of Tallahassee and move to an overnight encampment in Crestview, about 40 miles east of Pensacola. The first mission for the troops, Governor Bush said, would be to help rescue people stranded in flood waters and battered homes, and to provide a show of force to discourage the looting that followed last year's hurricanes. ''If anyone is crazy enough to loot, there is going to be a price paid,'' Governor Bush said. State officials said that reconnaissance teams and some rescue crews had moved into the Panhandle behind the storm on Sunday evening, but that most rescue and relief operations would probably not start until daybreak for safety reasons. ''We don't want to make victims of the responders,'' said Mike Stone, the spokesman for the emergency operations center. The American Red Cross stationed 23 tractor-trailers filled with emergency supplies on the edge of the storm area, along with 100 trucks containing emergency meals. David Rudduck, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said the agency was also taking precautions. The trucks were to start serving the 35,000 military-style meals as soon as it was safe, Mr. Rudduck said, adding, ''We don't want to subject our volunteers to danger.'' Tom Gallagher, the state's chief financial officer, said hundreds of insurance adjustors had also moved into position on the fringes of the storm and were expected to begin assessing damage claims on Monday. Around the state, thousands of homes that lost their roofs last year remain covered with bright blue tarpaulins. Many of them are in the Pensacola area, Governor Bush said, adding to the danger. HURRICANE DENNIS: THE RESPONSE"
"After strengthening over the Gulf of Mexico and scaring more than a million coastal residents into hotels, shelters and neighboring states, Hurricane Dennis weakened as it came ashore near Pensacola on Sunday afternoon, near where the devastating Hurricane Ivan made landfall last year. As it raced across the Florida Panhandle, the hurricane inundated some areas, uprooted trees, washed out roads and peeled roofs from homes but fell short of the destructive powers officials had feared. There were no reports of serious injuries or deaths, which officials attributed in part to the exodus that began on Thursday. The highest winds of the storm were measured at 120 miles an hour near the eye wall at landfall, making it a Category 3 storm; it had been a Category 4 earlier in the morning, with winds of 145 m.p.h. The difference of 25 m.p.h. in the winds may mean that Pensacola and its surrounding towns were spared millions of dollars of damage. ''I'm pleased that the winds died a bit,'' Gov. Jeb Bush told reporters at Florida's emergency command center in Tallahassee. ''The difference between a Category 3 and a Category 4 is the difference between being hit by a semi and a freight train,'' Mr. Bush said, paraphrasing a comment by Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center. Also contributing to the relative lack of destruction was the speed of the storm, which came ashore at a brisk 17 m.p.h., according to the hurricane center. Hurricane Ivan moved slowly over Pensacola last Sept. 16 with sustained winds of 130 m.p.h. and more powerful gusts. ''We got lucky on this one,'' said Sheriff Ron McNesby of Escambia County, which includes Pensacola. At the command center on Sunday evening, Craig Fugate, Florida's director of emergency management, said disaster teams had initially reported no substantial damage. But he emphasized that they had only begun their work. ''There are pretty much none of the reports of catastrophic building destruction that we had in Hurricanes Ivan and Charley last year,'' Mr. Fugate said. ''We're hearing about trees down, power lines down, but we're not seeing structural failures. We did have flooding along the coastal areas.'' The biggest problem across the path of the hurricane was power failures. The Associated Press reported that the storm cut electricity to more than 236,700 homes and businesses in the Florida Panhandle and to about 240,000 in Alabama. The Gulf Power Company, the main utility for the western Panhandle, said people should be prepared to go without electricity for at least three weeks. Flooding was widespread on the coast south of Tallahassee, The A.P. reported, with the town of St. Marks under a storm surge of 10 to 12 feet. About 40 miles of Highway 98 were flooded, The A.P. said. By Sunday night, the system had weakened to a tropical storm and was continuing its push through Alabama. Forecasters warned that the storm's heavy rains could cause flooding over the next few days. The National Weather Service said up to 12 inches of rain could fall in parts of the lower Ohio River Valley. Late on Sunday afternoon, President Bush, who is Governor Bush's brother, declared a major disaster in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi, making the states available for federal assistance. The deaths of at least 32 people in Haiti and Cuba were attributed to Hurricane Dennis as it cut across the Caribbean and bore down on the Gulf Coast. In Pensacola, a man thought to be in his 70's died early Sunday morning while taking shelter at the civic center, the Sheriff's Department said. Officials said they believed he died of natural causes, and it was unclear whether the death would be considered a storm-related fatality, Sheriff McNesby said. Elsewhere in Florida, a 3-year-old boy, Christopher Miller, was accidentally crushed to death on Friday by a car driven by his father, Gerald M. Miller, 32, as the family was evacuating their home in Defuniak Springs, officials said. Hurricane Dennis shut down airports, major highways and bridges in its path. Pensacola appeared all but deserted early Sunday morning, and sheriff's deputies were driving most of the few cars on the roads. Shelters in the area were about half full, with some 4,700 people arriving Saturday and Sunday, said Sonya Smith, the public information manager for Escambia County. Across the state at Cape Canaveral, the countdown began for Wednesday's launching of the space shuttle Discovery began precisely at 6 p.m., despite worries among National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials that the hurricane might force a delay. Meanwhile, respect for the storm could be measured by the number of people in Pensacola who sought refuge at shelters for the first time. ''This is a first for me,'' said Debra Crowley-Freeman, 47, a house painter who was waiting in the 8 a.m. breakfast line after a short night's sleep in a corridor at the civic center. ''I ran from Ivan. I wasn't going to run again. We couldn't find a place to stay, and we ended up driving around for two days.'' Eugene Lavern, a 61-year-old retiree who lives in a mobile home park, said he had never been in a shelter, either, and complained about sleeping on the concrete floor. ''Ain't no reason in the world they don't have bunk beds,'' he said. ''I know the government's got better money than that.'' On the beaches on Sunday evening, there were many signs of the storm's power. Streets were carpeted with tree limbs and covered by wide patches of sand. The wind had carried a vending machine from a gas station and flipped it over. In Gulf Breeze, the shell of a Circle K store, all that remained of the business after Hurricane Ivan, was flattened to a pile of lumber with a ragged metal roof. Private boats moored with anchors were pulled to other corners of Escambia Bay, although all appeared sound. In many instances, though, it was difficult to tell what was caused by Hurricane Dennis and what was left over from Hurricane Ivan. Most damage appeared to have been inflicted in areas where buildings were left vulnerable nearly 10 months ago. On Pensacola Beach, which sustained most of the damage to commercial buildings in the area, scaffolding on a hotel fell over and crushed a welcome center. On the same street, a trailer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency was overturned. But calls to county dispatchers were a fraction of those received last Sept. 16. ''The phones rang so much during Ivan,'' said Lynda Aiken, 44, the assistant officer in charge of communications. ''It was people crying and screaming and yelling that they needed our help. Today, we've been able to watch the storm on TV. We've been able to eat.'' As the storm came ashore, most of the approximately 55 calls to 911 were set off by automated alarm systems responding to power failures, she said. Officials said the relatively calm response to the hurricane could be attributed in part to its arrival during the day. ''We can see the intensity and see it moving, and it seems to be moving pretty fast through here, and that's good,'' said Ms. Smith, the county information manager. Residents interviewed after the winds died down on Sunday said they were relieved when the storm brought less damage than expected. ''We were prepared for much worse than this,'' said Steve Steinhauer, 43, of Gulf Breeze. ''Even until the last minute, when they said it was going to be 145-mile winds, we didn't know what to expect.'' HURRICANE DENNIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"The hurricane season is again rocking global oil markets at a time of tight supplies. Crude oil prices surged to a level above $61 a barrel yesterday after a tropical storm curbed production in the Gulf of Mexico and forced the evacuation of nearly 100 offshore operations. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $61.35 a barrel, then closed at $61.28, up $1.69 or 2.8 percent, after the storm, named Cindy, made landfall. Yesterday's closing price was the highest since Nymex began trading oil futures in 1983. The jump in oil prices contributed to falling share prices yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 101.12 points, to 10,270.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.05 points, to 1,194.94, and the Nasdaq lost 10.10 points, to 2,068.65. So far, the interruptions to production in the Gulf of Mexico, where some 1.5 million barrels of oil are produced each day, have been minimal. Katherine B. Spector, the head of energy strategy at J.P. Morgan Chase in New York, said: ''The storm's actual physical impact on oil production is not significant. But it's not zero either and we're only at the beginning of July.'' But traders were bracing for more disruptions -- and potentially higher oil prices -- as another tropical storm, Dennis, gained strength while heading toward the United States. That storm is expected to pick up speed and become a hurricane with winds reaching 115 miles an hour tomorrow, just south of Cuba. It is then forecast to hit Alabama on Monday morning, said Frank Lepore, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Late Tuesday, Tropical Storm Cindy reached shore, battering Louisiana and Mississippi with heavy rains and winds of nearly 70 miles an hour and leaving more than 300,000 people without power. In the Gulf of Mexico, it forced the evacuation of 85 offshore platforms and 11 rigs and reduced production by 190,000 barrels of oil, or 12 percent of the region's daily production, according to the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior. ''The market is finely tuned to hearing bullish news and that's what it's hearing right now,'' said Jan Stuart, an analyst with Fimat USA in New York. ''An early hurricane season is the last thing we needed right now. It's like pouring oil on the fire.'' This year's hurricane season is off to an exceptionally fast start, with four tropical storms already named since June 1, the most since 1851, Mr. Lepore said. Last year, three hurricanes -- Frances, Ivan and Jeanne -- caused billions of dollars in damage to oil sites. Global oil markets cannot afford to lose any output as most producers are pumping at their maximum to meet record demand. Rising consumption has pushed oil prices up by more than 40 percent this year and has been responsible for doubling oil prices in the last two years. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for a third of America's domestic oil production and has nearly 4,000 oil-producing sites, including 1,700 staffed platforms and hundreds of smaller single-well rigs. The concentration of so many production sites, as well as many refineries along the coasts of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, makes the American oil industry particularly vulnerable to storms and hurricanes. Tropical Storm Cindy also caused the closing of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, America's largest oil-importing terminal, as a precaution on Tuesday. ''It's very early in the season for hurricanes to come out,'' said Chris Oynes, regional director in the New Orleans office of the Minerals Management Service, which lost its electric power in the storm. Many traders are concerned that an early start to the hurricane season could have consequences like last September's events when Hurricane Ivan caused extensive damage to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico; oil prices then pushed above $50 a barrel for the first time. The hurricane seriously damaged or destroyed 31 platforms and more than 10 percent of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was affected for at least four months. This year is forecast to have a worse-than-normal hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in May that it expected the 2005 season in the Atlantic to include 12 to 15 tropical storms, with 7 to 9 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 of them major hurricanes. MARKET PLACE"
"The newest hurricane, desigated Emily, battered the Yucatán peninsula in the early hours on Monday, leaving millions of people without power, water or telephone service, but causing few deaths before limping back into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where it was expected to regain some of its fearsome strength. The storm swept ashore near the island of Cozumel about 1 a.m., after having killed five people as it swept Jamaica on Sunday. Though no Mexicans died as a direct result of flooding or wreckage, one man was electrocuted while preparing for the storm and two helicopter pilots trying to evacuate an offshore oil rig died when a gust knocked them out of the sky. Still, Emily caused heavy damage to power lines up and down the coast from Cancún to Tulum, leaving 70 percent of the area without power. The storm was strongest along the road between the resort towns of Playa del Carmen and Tulum, home of the famous seaside Mayan ruins. The winds bent a giant cellphone tower in half, collapsed two gasoline stations, snapped concrete power-line poles and uprooted dozens of streetlights. Heavy steel billboards were crumpled in half, as if by a giant hand. Metal street signs were bent to the ground. Uprooted trees littered the highway, until crews cleared the roads just after dawn. In Playa del Carmen, signs were torn down, cars buried under rubble and roofs missing. People unlucky enough to live in traditional wooden buildings told stories of weathering the storm in whatever concrete room they could find. Lucía López Reyes, 55, huddled in the corner of her wooden home with her two grandchildren and son while the 135-mile-an-hour winds ripped off the roof. She and her son, Eduardo Díaz Reyes, sat forlornly amid the wreckage on Monday. ''It was very hard, because it left me no house,'' she said. ''There is no money to repair it.'' Farther down the main Highway 307, Félix Sojelo, who is 41, was hiding in the concrete room that makes up the back half of his roadside taco stand with his mother and children when the shrieking wind was suddenly joined by an enormous crash. On Monday morning, he found his restaurant destroyed by two poles carrying live power lines. ''I told the kids not to touch anything metal,'' he said, staring at the poles where the roof of his restaurant once was. ''We are going to push ahead. Like John Travolta, I'm staying alive.'' Most of the resorts along the Yucatán coast escaped the storm with minor damage. A prominent exception was Akumal, a resort community popular with Americans, which was badly mauled, with some of its condominiums and vacation homes missing their thatched roofs. Thousands of tourists spent an uncomfortable night in makeshift shelters: a gymnasium in Cancún was packed with vacationers who complained they had been locked in. About 30 Dutch tourists were taken from their seaside hotel in Playa del Carmen to a safer building with concrete walls on the main highway. Farmers suffered as well. Mexican authorities said corn, papaya and citrus crops were wiped out. In the village of Macario Gómez, about 12 miles northwest of Tulum, farmers were playing cards on Monday afternoon and bemoaning the loss of their corn. The Mexican authorities said the low death toll proved that the emergency management systems they have put in place since the late 1980's, when Hurricane Gilbert killed 327 people, worked well. Lucio Salvador Arguea, the head of the Civil Protection department in Tulum, said the police and emergency workers had changed the culture here, convincing people through constant advertising and public education programs that they should seek shelter during the storm and pay attention to government warnings. ''We thought that Tulum would disappear, but thanks to God, the impact wasn't that great,'' he said."
"On the national weather maps yesterday, the remains of Hurricane Dennis looked like the print of an elephant's foot in red dust -- an isolated low-pressure system lingering in hot weather. The storm was centered squarely over the middle Mississippi River, where it promised to bring drenching rains. And late on Monday, a tropical depression in the Caribbean, Dennis's successor, was upgraded to a tropical storm, which means, among other things, that it gained a name: Emily. This is the fifth named storm this season -- more named storms by this time in the hurricane season than ever before. At last report, Emily was plunging westward toward Barbados at wind speeds still short of hurricane force. Giving a storm a name does not necessarily mean anthropomorphizing it. If Emily happened to be called Epsilon, its history would be no different. Yet a human name somehow conveys the analogy between the relative waywardness of storms and the relatively open-ended possibilities of the human personality. So far, the storms of this season have not shown the truculence of last season's. It feels, somehow, as if this year's storms have lined up in an almost orderly fashion, one after another, to take their chances at landfall and more epic status, like bus passengers in a Flannery O'Connor story. But for the humans who wait on shore, these can mean only tribulation. Even storms that just barely qualify as hurricanes pack an enormous punch, and in their aftermath -- as the Northeast knows all too well -- they leave a sodden populace grimacing at a leaden sky. Emily may have broken a record, but we can hope that she is the last in line, for a little while at least. Editorial"
"Coastal residents from the Florida Keys all the way to Louisiana scrambled or held their breath on Friday as Hurricane Dennis plowed through Cuba before surging to the Gulf of Mexico barely a month into hurricane season. The storm hit the southern coast of Cuba with wind gusts that reached 149 miles an hour, killing at least 10 people, The Associated Press reported, and causing extensive damage to Cienfuegos. Before reaching Cuba, the storm caused severe flooding in Haiti, killing 10 people. Forecasters expected the hurricane to brush past Key West overnight before reaching the Gulf Coast, which is still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Ivan last year. It could strike anywhere from southeast of Tallahassee, Fla., to the Mississippi-Louisiana line, a range of almost 400 miles. Projections by the National Weather Service suggested that the prime target could be the Pensacola region, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Ivan. Some people grew excited at the sights and sounds of preparation like long lines for gasoline and food, crowded hotel parking lots and drilling for storm shutters. But aggravation and despair were more usual. Even steely survivors of past hurricanes, including the four that hit Florida over six weeks last year and caused more than $20billion in property damage, were unnerved by the early arrival of such a dangerous storm. ''I really wasn't ready for this,'' said Jan Henry, who lives on a boat in Key West, which has not seen a major hurricane in decades. ''I'm used to waiting until August before I have to start securing my boat. It's way too early.'' About 50,000 tourists and residents in the Keys faced evacuation orders, and the sole highway north was clogged throughout the rainy, breezy day. Many people, including Bruce Hirshman, an anesthesiologist in Key West, stayed put rather than face a sea of evacuation traffic. ''I have to balance what the danger is here,'' Mr. Hirshman said after closing his office. ''And being caught in a storm on the road behind slow traffic.'' By Friday night, the storm weakened slightly as it moved across Cuba with maximum sustained winds of 110 m.p.h. Fierce rain squalls and stiff winds struck as far north as Miami, although the Florida Panhandle remained serene. In Gulf Breeze, a Panhandle town that barely survived Hurricane Ivan, the assistant city manager, Dave Symanski, said his team was ''in combat mode'' and counting on volunteers to help. Hurricane Dennis is not due to hit the Gulf Coast until Sunday afternoon, but most residents of Gulf Breeze, bordered on three sides by water, were already leaving, he said. ''People don't want to stick around and go through another one,'' Mr. Symanski said. ''And they're fearful that they'll have to come back to the remnants of a destroyed city. Right now, everyone seems to be a bit shellshocked.'' Some Florida gasoline stations ran out of fuel, stoking memories of cars stranded along roads in the storms last year. Sondra Byrd, a cashier at the Avalon Express gasoline station in Milton, near Pensacola, said 100 cars at a time lined up for fuel Thursday night. The station stayed open until 2 a.m. By Friday afternoon, the pumps were running dry. ''People were impatient, but oddly calm,'' Ms. Byrd said. ''The rumor is that we're not going to get any more gas, because we get our fuel reserves from Louisiana and they're not going to let their barges go in the gulf.'' Oil companies removed hundreds of employees from drilling platforms in the gulf and curbed some production. By midday, the storm had led to the evacuations of 81 platforms and 35 rigs in the gulf and cut production by 220,000 barrels, or 15 percent of the daily oil production in the region, the Interior Department said. Gov. Jeb Bush, who halted a vacation in Maine, said fuel companies were sending additional trucks to affected regions. Mr. Bush declared a state of emergency, as did the governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which still has 1,000 full-time workers helping Florida recover from the 2004 storms, said it was shifting from recovery to preparation mode. ''We have the luxury of having some very talented people within this state,'' an official, Scott Morris, said. In Pensacola, William S. Wirth, marketing director of the Pensacola Little Theater, said the recovery from Hurricane Ivan now felt like a waste. ''Based on the reports I've heard,'' Mr. Wirth said, ''it seems like we're going to have to do this all over again. I feel like we're living in World War II. It's as if we're in London and we're getting ready for another bombing attack by the Nazis. We're getting ready for our city to be devastated. We'll have to pick up again with no electricity, no communications, no running water, waiting in line for gas and basics for survival.'' Sandie Aaron, a manager at the Pensacola Civic Center, said she expected 2,600 people to use that building as a shelter, far more than the 1,700 who huddled there for Hurricane Ivan. In that storm, which caused 29 deaths when it hit on Sept. 16, the five-story complex lost a huge part of its roof. ''You learn a lot, but I don't think you'll ever be totally prepared,'' Ms. Aaron said. ''You never know what kind of curve you're going to be thrown. The short-term repairs have been made, but the long-term repairs have not.'' Beverly Chin, who had traveled to Pensacola Beach from Houston for a family reunion, watched her son siphon gasoline to her car from his and said she could hardly imagine living in the region. ''If I owned a business in Pensacola or had a home here, I don't think I would stay,'' Ms. Chin said. ''The beaches in Pensacola are beautiful. But getting pummeled with two hurricanes in less than a year is too much for anyone to handle.'' At Cape Canaveral, the space shuttle Discovery was ruled safe on its launching pad, and NASA still aimed for a liftoff on Wednesday, the first since the Columbia disaster. By Friday afternoon, the storm track appeared to be shifting slightly west, narrowing the chances of a severe hit on the Keys. Mayor Jimmy Weekley of Key West eliminated one way of riding out the storm by ordering a ban on alcohol sales as of 5 p.m. He also ordered stores and bars to close at that time. Asked about repercussions from bar owners, Mr. Weekley said, ''I have an unpublished number.'' In New Orleans, in the potential strike zone, business was light at Mary's True Value Hardware in the French Quarter. ''If later today or tomorrow the weathermen say it's coming this way,'' the owner, Huston Mishe, said, ''then it's going to get real crazy real quick.'' At the French Quarter Postal Emporium, a clerk, David Mangin, said he was planning to board up the store and ride out the storm. ''People are saying, 'I'm not going to get stuck on the road like I did last year,''' Mr. Mangin said. Last year, when Hurricane Ivan threatened New Orleans, gridlock turned a normal hour's drive to Baton Rouge into a 12- or 16-hour nightmare. George Green voiced what seemed the most common sentiment when, standing outside Clyde's Barber Shop on St. Bernard Avenue, he said it was simply too early to agitate. ''Ain't nobody making a move until tomorrow morning,'' he said."
"Residents braced for the coming hurricane on Saturday while stepping over piles of nearly year-old debris from the last one. Tammie Muller, 45, filling plastic bags with sand from a playground, pointed to the spot a few yards away where the water finally stopped rising that day last September, and burst into tears without warning. Casey Durant, 4, had been wearing a shirt her family recently found among possessions from their house that was destroyed -- but she took it off because it itched from the tiny particles of insulation. On one boarded-up house, the before-and-after-and-before time warp was written out in three painted words on the plywood: ''Ivan Go Away!'' Hurricane Ivan came and went away from Pensacola on Sept. 16, a Category 3 storm that killed 29 people here and destroyed or damaged thousands of homes and buildings. On Saturday, as Hurricane Dennis bore down an almost identical path as Hurricane Ivan's -- gaining strength as it approached -- weary Pensacola residents did their best to shore up again, both physically and mentally. Many said they would drive north Saturday evening, a few hours ahead of the storm's outer bands, while others -- although clearly a minority in most of September's hardest-hit areas -- said they would ride it out behind their familiar layers of wood and nails and sand. Thousands of residents moved into shelters on Friday as the storm seemed to veer slightly to the west, toward an Alabama landfall. In that state, Gov. Bob Riley declared a mandatory evacuation for Mobile County, a measure not taken in recent memory. Nerves are frayed. ''They're seeing the kinds of problems you normally see after the storm,'' said Paul Muller, a retired Pensacola police officer with plenty of friends still on the job. ''People fighting over cutting in line at the gas station, or taking the last thing off the shelf.'' Across town, Lois Whitley, 67, awoke to find most of the storm guards for her windows missing from the garage. ''Eleven are missing,'' she said after calling the police. ''Stealing from a widow.'' At a news conference, Sheriff Ron McNesby of Escambia County, where Pensacola is located, urged residents of surrounding counties to ''be patient'' with the exodus. ''Normally we have a hard time getting people to evacuate, but since our last hurricane, it's not a problem,'' he said. There were more than 900 calls to 911 from low-lying areas during Hurricane Ivan, with deputies pulled off the street and unable to respond. Of grave concern to the authorities here were the dangerous states of construction, preconstruction or demolition remaining in the low-lying coastal areas. There was less concern about vegetative debris, like trees, because most of the trees are gone. In the Grand Lagoon subdivision on the water, perhaps hardest hit by Hurricane Ivan with several deaths, piles of wood and broken cinderblocks at the curb carried the threat of transforming into dangerous missiles when Hurricane Dennis's high winds hit. Passengers arriving in town by airplane could look out the windows and see streets dotted with telltale blue plastic tarps stretched across rooftops. ''Hell, it looks good here now,'' said Sheriff's Deputy Rick Durant, who lost a house in the Grand Lagoon area, recalling how he called his wife last September to tell her that not only their house, but most of the block, had been wiped out. Dr. Jamie Covan, 43, a Pensacola dentist, looked at a debris pile, taller than him, beside his large, three-year-old beachside home in Grand Lagoon. ''It took them a while to get their debris cleaned up,'' Dr. Covan said, referring to his neighbors; he wondering aloud whether it was now too late. During Hurricane Ivan, he and his wife threw their lawn furniture into the swimming pool. It was washed away anyway. He said he was confident in his home's state-of-the-art windows, certified to withstand gusts of 135 miles an hour. Elsewhere, in working-class neighborhoods, there are no such windows, just sheets of wood. Robert Shumpert, 70, hammer in hand, looked over his shoulder at his brand new carport, which replaced the one Hurricane Ivan blew away. ''We just finished it two days ago,'' Mr. Shumpert said. ''I'm fixing to lose it again. We're not in as bad a shape as it might seem, but it's bad enough. You can't get anybody to come out here,'' he said, echoing complaints of a shortage of roofers after Hurricane Ivan. Hal Peebles, 72, a retired Navy officer, lived in Grand Lagoon for 25 years until his home was washed off its foundation by Hurricane Ivan. ''I know people who barely escaped with their lives,'' Mr. Peebles said, stopping to borrow a sheet of plywood from a former neighbor. ''There are fewer of those after Ivan. If you didn't learn your lesson with Ivan, you're not going to.'' He looked at the half-repaired and under-construction homes around him and said, ''If this is a Category 4 or 5, all of this will be gone.'' Ms. Muller said that she left town with her husband as Hurricane Ivan approached last year, and began to cry as she remembered coming home. ''When we left last time, this whole place was a mess,'' she said. ''The whole city was just torn up. And then people started coming up dead. It was very scary.'' South Florida was spared serious damage from Hurricane Dennis. In southern Miami-Dade County, gusting wind knocked out many of the traffic lights along U.S. Route 1, one of the main routes to and from the Florida Keys. Few cars were on the road early Saturday morning, and police cruisers were stationed at intersections where the traffic lights were out. According to radio broadcasts, more than 100,000 homes in Miami-Dade County were without electricity. But most homes in the county still had power. Weather reports had suggested that there was little probability that Miami and the rest of the east coast of Florida would get much of the force of Hurricane Dennis. Residents seemed to take the arrival of the storm in stride. They had either stocked up on batteries, water and other emergency supplies or concluded they would not need them. In drugstores in the southern part of Miami-Dade County there were plenty of batteries and no lines of customers stocking up. Amy Halsey and her husband, Douglas, had scheduled a dinner party for Friday night in their home in Pinecrest and went right ahead as the local television station reported nonstop on the approaching hurricane. The lights in their dining room flickered and then went out about 10 p.m. Ms. Halsey simply struck matches and lit a row of candles in the center of her long table; there was not even a pause in conversation. But in Pensacola, busy hands cut wood throughout the morning, and Hal Banks, 46, paused in his garage from his sawing and joked that Arizona was looking pretty good. ''A lot of us are just shell-shocked,'' Mr. Banks said. ''The unwritten rule is that you get one hurricane season off, but that hasn't happened.''"
"Crude oil prices rose 5 percent yesterday on revived concerns that supplies will be tight this summer and through the end of the year. Oil contracts for July delivery rose $2.61, to $54.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday, their highest since April 22. Oil prices, up 25 percent since the beginning of the year, have more than doubled in two years. Gasoline futures rose 5 percent, to $1.542 a gallon on the Nymex. Weekly government statistics, which will be released today, are expected to show a small drop in commercial inventories, after several weeks of buildup. That would indicate that refiners are starting to gear up to meet higher demand in the second half of the year. ''There's a feeling that most of the good news is behind us and that we've turned a corner,'' said Thomas Bentz, a senior oil analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. ''What can I say, it's a wild market.'' After falling off from its high of $58.20 a barrel in April, crude oil had retreated to the mid-$40's, reflecting increases in commercial inventories and efforts by oil producers to keep pumping close to their maximum levels. Producers with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which met in March in Iran, agreed to keep oil flowing in the second quarter, despite a seasonal drop in demand, to build stocks. But with producers having little spare capacity and with global demand still growing, many analysts fear that any interruption in supplies would be hard to offset. In the last seven sessions, oil prices have gained $7.78 a barrel, or 16 percent, as traders focused once more on the second half of the year. The period includes the busy summer driving season and the start of the winter heating season. Of particular concern is the fourth quarter, when the International Energy Agency is forecasting worldwide demand will rise to 86.1 million barrels a day. That is four million barrels a day more than the quarter in 2003. In addition, traders are also bracing for another above-normal hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last month that it expected the 2005 season in the Atlantic would include 12 to 15 tropical storms, with 7 to 9 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 of them major hurricanes. Last year, Hurricane Ivan caused extensive disruptions to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. It took months to restore production to normal. Also, Jan Stuart, an analyst with Fimat USA, said the news last week that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia was in a hospital, possibly for pneumonia treatment, reminded many analysts of the high potential for political instability in the kingdom. The king, believed to be in his 80's, suffered a stroke a decade ago that has left him in poor health. Crown Prince Abdullah, also in his 80's, has ruled since, but no clear succession has been established after him. ''In the minds of quite a few oil industry folks the passing of Fahd brings with it significant potential for instability in the upper echelons of the ruling family of the world's largest oil exporter,'' Mr. Stuart said in a note to investors. ''That's when buyers look for a few extra barrels 'just in case.''' For Mr. Bentz, traders are considering $50 or $51 a barrel as an opportunity to buy. As for a high? ''Crude oil will go to $60,'' he said. ''I don't know when, whether in the third or in the fourth quarter, but it will happen.''"
"Not far from where Hurricane Charley ravaged entire towns along Florida's Gulf Coast last August, Kevin O'Brien is building the fortress of his dreams: a dome-shaped home that stands out on his suburban street like some concrete U.F.O. ''It's not something that is truly accepted yet,'' said Mr. O'Brien, explaining that his 20-by-30-foot home in Venice, about 70 miles south of Tampa, would withstand winds of at least 150 miles per hour. ''But this is the place you and your family know you are going to be safe.'' Two weeks into a new hurricane season -- with the first official tempest of 2005, Tropical Storm Arlene, already churning toward the Florida Panhandle on Friday -- homeowners across the state are taking defensive measures to guard against a repetition of the calamities they suffered last year. Not all are going to such extraordinary lengths as Mr. O'Brien, a neuromuscular therapist. But many are ordering $15,000 worth of unbreakable windows, testing new-fangled shutters and, taking advantage of a two-week tax holiday on storm supplies, stockpiling batteries, tarpaulins and the like. With Florida still recovering from more than $20 billion in property damage from four consecutive hurricanes last summer, with wrecked shingles, roof beams, siding and pool screens still piled up from Pensacola to Palm Beach, and with more than 10,000 families still in temporary shelter, no one wants to gamble this year. Although Tropical Storm Arlene was expected to hit only Florida's northwestern tip, it blew wind and rain through much of the state on Friday, making palm trees dance and spreading skittishness far earlier than usual. ''People learned their lesson last year, absolutely,'' said Pat Petrusse, owner of Advanced Environmental Hurricane Protection of Jacksonville, which sells stormproofing products and was especially busy this spring. ''They're upgrading their buildings, trying to protect themselves.'' Hurricane shutters, which many Floridians had forgone in recent years because they are cumbersome and expensive, are now so coveted that materials and installers are in short supply and many companies have long wait lists. Homeowners who ordered shutters in March or April might not see them until September or October, as the storm season ends. Traditional aluminum shutters, while still popular, are losing favor to a new variety made of strong, clear plastic and to screens made of trampoline-like material, several shutter suppliers said. Flying debris bounces off the screens, which cost about $19 per square foot compared with about $45 for roll-up shutters, Mr. Petrusse said. Clear shutters are catching on, after many people kept their metal shutters up for months last year and lived in darkness. ''A lot of people like them because, bingo, you can see through it,'' said Pam Bohen, owner of Home Safety Solutions in Palm Harbor. ''You're not trapped in a cave.'' Ms. Bohen said her 19-year-old company was having one of its busiest years ever, selling things like safety film for windows and a fabric called Force 12 that protects lanais and pool enclosures. Customers are ''mixing and matching,'' she said, spending $600 to $60,000 to stormproof every vulnerable cranny. Impact-resistant windows are another popular item in the wake of last year's storms, when shattered windows led to extensive water and mold damage and made it easier for roofs to blow off. Calvin Gray, vice president of sales and marketing for The Window Pros in Sarasota, said his company sold $500,000 worth of impact-resistant windows and patio doors in April and $1 million worth in May. Such windows cost about $1,000 each, including installation, he said. ''We've literally doubled our business,'' said Mr. Gray, whose company serves the region of southwest Florida battered by Hurricane Charley's 180-mile-an-hour wind gusts. ''No one needs to be sold anymore. People recognize this is no longer a luxury, and very much a necessity.'' While homeowners buy more protection, government and nonprofit agencies that deal with hurricanes are thinking outside the box. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has proposed using docked cruise ships as temporary housing for storm victims, saying they would be more efficient than the trailers it shipped in, often not quickly enough, last year. The founder of a nonprofit group in Tampa has developed a matchmaking service of sorts, connecting people who need shelter in hurricanes with volunteer hosts who have similar interests. Visit Florida, the state's tourism agency, is offering ''Cover Your Event Insurance'' to help cover the cost of rescheduling conventions and other meetings put off because of hurricanes. The program will pay up to $200,000 for business groups to rebook after storms in August, September or October. Last year's hurricanes provided a rare laboratory for builders and designers from around the country, who swarmed to Florida to study what withstood the extreme weather and what did not. The evidence they gathered helped to promote existing products or to devise new ones, many of which could be found in January at the International Builders' Show in Orlando. Panic rooms were on display at the show, but Dr. Timothy Reinhold of the Institute for Business and Home Safety, an insurance industry group in Tampa, said they made more sense in tornado zones. The same might be said for bunkers, though Jorge Villa, owner of a Miami company called U.S. Bunkers, said he had been ''pretty busy'' this year. He sells steel and concrete bunkers, from $12,000, for a 12-ton unit that fits inside a garage, to $48,000, for a larger outdoor model. ''The garage units are built so the whole house can fall on top of it and nothing happens,'' Mr. Villa said. ''You can be in there as long as you have to. With three battery packs, you can survive three days.'' As for dome-shaped homes, which got new respect after Hurricane Ivan left one on Pensacola Beach remarkably unscathed last September, Dr. Reinhold said they were uncommonly durable but not a must-have. ''Someone has really got to want it,'' he said. ''Our feeling is that any of the house shapes out there, if they are properly designed and attention is paid to the details, can be made to work.'' Still, Mr. O'Brien hopes that after last year's quartet of storms, which led to 1.7 million insurance claims -- about 5 percent of which remain unsettled -- Floridians will embrace dome architecture as ardently as they have ranch homes with screened-in pools. He has started a consulting group to advise on dome home construction, he said, and will build a Mediterranean-style, porch-like structure around his dome home to make it more attractive. He says his home, which he began building even before last year's storms, costs about $100 a square foot. ''It's going to take on a look that opens quite a few eyes,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ''With the correct engineering, you can make just about anything look pretty nice.''"
"Santa Rosa Island, in the Gulf Islands National Seashore off the Florida Panhandle, does not look like much of a battleground, even though the 170-year-old Fort Pickens guards its western end. But this tiny stretch of sand has become a new focus in a long-running and intense debate about how people can coexist with nature on the coast. The island is a flat sandy barrier whose dunes have been virtually destroyed in recent storms. Its lone road, County Road 399, had to be moved after Hurricane Opal in 1995, and it was damaged by subsequent storms. It was washed out by Hurricane Ivan last year and rebuilt, only to wash out again in Tropical Storm Arlene in June. Rebuilt again, it washed out again in Hurricane Dennis the next month. After that damage was repaired, Hurricane Katrina struck. It was then that some park officials began to wonder whether it was time to do something more than rebuild. Maybe, they said, it was time to bolster the road with metal or rocks or other armor. That would maintain access to island beaches, the fort and a nearby campground, attractions that until Katrina had made the seashore a major attraction of the National Park Service. ''There's been a road there for over 50 years, and my personal feeling is we have an obligation to do our best to provide that,'' said Jerry Eubanks, superintendent of the seashore. But not everyone agrees. The park service policy calls for letting nature take its course on the seashore. One reason is the damage that results when eroding beaches like Santa Rosa Island are armored with rock or metal walls. Eventually, encroaching water will reach the armor, leaving the beach itself under water, a drama that has often played out on United States coasts, most of which are eroding. Many coastal scientists say people have to learn to live with nature rather than trying to hold off the ocean with walls and other structures. One advocate of this view, Robert J. Young, a coastal geologist at Western Carolina University, said he was particularly disappointed to learn that the park officials were contemplating armoring Santa Rosa Island. ''It's heartbreaking,'' Mr. Young said. ''How can you expect the developed shoreline to take this issue seriously if the parks agency, on a pristine shoreline, are using brute-force management? It's really discouraging.'' So the people considering the fate of County Road 399 find themselves in the middle of an intense environmental debate that has been raging with growing intensity since the late 1960's, when an explosion of development began transforming the nation's ocean coasts. Today, the argument is further fueled by changes in the weather. In a decades-long cycle, experts say, a period of relative hurricane calm has given way to a period of more and stronger storms. Global warming will only make things worse. Mr. Eubanks, the seashore superintendent, said the roadway on Santa Rosa Island typically failed when strong storms sent water rushing across it in sheets. The water scours out the base of the road, and pretty soon it is reduced to slabs of asphalt half buried in sand. Park officials are considering a number of repairs, he said, including the possibility of lowering the road so storm waters would wash over it. After that, it would be reinforced. In a report on the situation, Volkert & Associates, an engineering concern in Mobile, Ala., said there were a number of ways the repairs be done, but it recommended building a kind of seawall made of sheets of corrugated metal called sheet piling that would be driven deep into the sand along the seaward edge of the road. If this construction proceeded, it would also be possible to run a sewer line to Fort Pickens to replace the septic system there. Mr. Eubanks, who trained as an engineer though he has not recently worked in the field, said he believed that this kind of design would be ''very little impediment'' to the island and would enable workers to clear the road of sand after storms. But David B. Shaver, chief of the geologic resources division of the park service, said that when he learned of these plans he feared ''that things were moving a little too fast.'' The seashore was developing a general management plan, he said, but the storms this year, and the emergency repair funds that followed, arrived before the process was complete and ''before we had a handle on long-term impacts.'' ''We have to balance cultural resources with natural resources,'' he said, adding that while there was a lot of pressure from commercial interests to maintain access to the park, maybe there should be a ''shift in that relative balance, visitor use versus preservation.'' ''That's an active debate,'' he went on. He said that no action would be taken on any plans until after Jan. 1, and that until then, construction of anything permanent ''is on hold pending analysis.'' Rebecca Beavers, a coastal geologist for the park service, said officials were considering ways to maintain road access between Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach, island towns separated by a stretch of park. But right now, she added, ''we are working on interim options that would not require hard stabilization.'' That is good, in the view of people opposed to any armor, because it gives them time to make the case that armoring the road will ultimately be bad for the beach. ''To maintain this road with a seawall is madness,'' said Orrin H. Pilkey Jr., director of the Duke University Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines and a fervent opponent of development on vulnerable barrier islands. ''They say, 'Well, it's only there for storms,' '' said Dr. Pilkey, an author of ''Living on the Edge of the Gulf'' (Duke University Press, 2001), which characterizes most of the western end of Santa Rosa Island as an area of ''extreme'' erosion risk. ''That's not the way it's going to work. It will be a seawall before long -- in the water. In itself, it will enhance the erosion of the beach.'' He and others point to the strategy that the park service adopted when the Atlantic Ocean threatened the famous lighthouse in the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina. After years of intense debate, the lighthouse was moved 1,600 feet inland in 1999, a step applauded by people who advocate keeping human infrastructure out of nature's path. Dr. Pilkey said the debate over County Road 399 reminded him of arguments over the lighthouse. He said he saw ''the same lack of sympathy for, the same lack of understanding, the same just plain ignorance of shoreline processes.'' He added, ''It's a very short-term view: 'We are going to save that road.' '' Dr. Pilkey said he wished the park service would consider other ways of maintaining access to seashore attractions like ferries from the mainland. And he said he hoped that once people understood the underlying geological processes shaping the island in an era of rising seas, they would recognize the problems of the armor approach. ''People say, 'What are you going to do, let the road fall in?' '' he continued. ''The correct answer, of course, is yes.''"
"Members of Congress, soon returning home for the holidays, will get a stark message on Tuesday that tens of thousands of this city's people are still unable to do so. A full-page advertisement -- set to appear in the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, paid for by former residents of the ravaged middle-class Lakeview section and billed as a ''Message From Homeless New Orleanians'' -- pleads with Congress to pay for stronger levees. It also reminds the lawmakers that things are far from normal in a city where block after block remains ghostly and dark. ''Since the breakdown of the New Orleans flood protection system on August 29, 2005, we have lived like refugees in our own country,'' the advertisement says. ''The residents of Lakeview and countless other displaced New Orleans communities are sending you this holiday wish in one voice -- 'We want to go home.' '' The advertisement was born of desperation, said Nancy McSwain, who helped put it together. Ms. McSwain, whose Lakeview home took in over eight feet of water and has been looted three times since, is now living in a one-room apartment in Jackson, Miss. ''Our lives are on hold right now,'' she said. ''I feel so cut off from everything familiar.'' The advertisement cost nearly $10,000, which was collected online from Lakeview residents, organizers said. The idea, they said, followed a crowded meeting for which residents returned here in early October and where a sense of common purpose was fostered. Since then, with little apparent activity in Washington and with rebuilding slow in New Orleans, frustration and determination have grown in equal measure, said Cherie Melancon Franz, another organizer. ''I just want to make it clear we're not complaining,'' Ms. Franz said. ''We just want to gain some awareness for our situation.'' Ms. Franz is now living in an apartment in Allen, Tex., outside Dallas, with her husband and 3-year-old daughter. Their Lakeview home was flooded with seven feet of water, but she wants to return to New Orleans. ''It's Christmastime, and we're still not home,'' she said. ''We miss our family and friends. Everybody I've spoken to who's had to leave is having serious culture shock.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE LEVEES"
"It is cheering to see that New Orleans has not been completely forgotten. The White House's request for an additional $1.5 billion for hurricane protection demonstrates that the city's fate has not slipped entirely off the agenda in Washington. As a result, residents hoping to return to their homes in time for Christmas can think about rebuilding with a little more confidence than before. Most important of all, it ought to remove from the table for good the question of whether we should or would rebuild the city. We must rebuild it -- or to be more precise, give New Orleans the ability to rebuild itself. The administration has indicated it will stand by President Bush's pledge to do so. The issue now is not whether to do it, but how to do it right. As a first step, the White House request is a good one. But if this is the entire plan to protect greater New Orleans, it is woefully insufficient. It may protect against a storm of Katrina's size, but probably not a more ferocious one. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana probably put it best when she called it a ''down payment.'' The president's absence at the announcement is also duly noted. He needs to step up personally and more forcefully to ensure that New Orleans receives the support he has promised it. And even this interim victory can't be declared too soon -- Congress still needs to act on his proposal and the larger aid package of which it would be a part. The president had previously committed $1.6 billion to repair the levees and the floodwalls that failed during Hurricane Katrina, patching and restoring them to their strength before the monster storm hit. The additional money would be used to reinforce the levees where they are vulnerable with concrete and rock. It would pay for new pumping stations to get the water out of the city. Several canals that carried the massive storm surge would be closed off, most likely with gates. On the day of the announcement, the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, stood next to Mr. Bush's Hurricane Katrina reconstruction czar, Donald Powell, and praised the plan. He said that the city had a commitment and financing for hurricane protection beyond what it had ever had before. Mr. Nagin said, ''I want to say to all New Orleanians, to all businesses, 'It's time for you to come home.' '' We owe it to those who heed the mayor's call to raise the system's strength until it can endure a Category 5 storm. That means more than just bracing existing walls. It means restoring the vanishing natural defenses of the wetlands, which need to be a significant share of any comprehensive plan. That alone will cost billions, but current proposals include just $250 million. We can greet the new commitment warmly while still marveling that the city and the state had to beg and wait for what amounts to a rounding error in the federal budget. This is a good start. But more than 100 days after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, we should have long since moved beyond a good start. Editorial"
"Home building picked up speed in November, the government reported yesterday, indicating that the housing market in much of the country remains robust, though below records set earlier this year. A Labor Department report, also released yesterday, showed that the Producer Price Index fell by 0.7 percent last month as energy prices fell 4 percent. Prices excluding the volatile energy and food sectors were up 0.1 percent from October, less than economists had expected. Taken together, the reports further supported the opinion of many analysts that the economy has recovered from much of the damage inflicted by high energy prices and the hurricanes and is poised to end 2005 on a high note. A major concern in the last few months has been the health of the nation's long housing boom, which has shown signs of slowing. The Commerce Department said housing starts increased 5.3 percent last month, to an annual rate of 2.2 million, from the month before and was 17.5 percent higher than in November 2004. Permits for new housing, a measure that indicates future construction, were up 2.5 percent for the month and 3 percent for the year. The housing start statistics have a significant margin of error -- plus or minus 7.7 percent for the monthly change and 6.8 percent for the annual change -- suggesting that the figures are likely to be revised up or down as more data is collected. ''There is no question that we are going out in this year with a lot of momentum,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a research firm. ''That momentum will carry us through at least the first half of next year,'' he said, but added that construction would slow in the second half of the year as mortgage interest rates continue to rise and the benefits of reconstruction on the Gulf Coast taper off. He said he expected the annualized monthly rate to slip to 1.84 million homes in the second half of the year, down from the 2.2 million in November of this year. Mortgage rates, at historic lows for much of the year, have recently climbed to a national average of 6.3 percent for a 30-year fixed mortgage last week, from a low of 5.53 percent in June, according to Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are expected to rise further because the Federal Reserve has indicated it will continue to raise interest rates in the new year. The housing market, particularly for new homes, has proved forecasters, and even home builders, wrong in recent months. The National Association of Home Builders said Monday that an index that measures the confidence of its members fell 4 points this month, to 57. While still considered an optimistic reading, the decline was the second consecutive monthly one and it left the index at its lowest level in more than three years. Builders surveyed said they were offering more promotions to lure buyers, who are increasingly resisting higher home prices. On the broader inflation front, prices also appear to be cooling off, mostly because of lower energy prices. At the wholesale level, gasoline prices dropped 10.7 percent and heating oil tumbled 15.5 percent last month after increasing by similarly large numbers in September and October. Prices for cars and light trucks fell 0.8 percent. But the November price declines have not made up completely for the sharp increase in energy prices earlier this year. The Producer Price Index, which in contrast to the Consumer Price Index does not include distribution costs, subsidies and taxes, was up 4.4 percent from November 2004; excluding energy and food it was up 1.7 percent for the 12 months."
"With an estimated 18 million cubic yards of storm debris still on the ground, residents of 11 Gulf Coast towns in Mississippi got their first look this week at detailed planning proposals for rebuilding roads, houses and buildings wiped out by Hurricane Katrina. The residents, who attended a series of public meetings on Wednesday and Thursday, generally embraced the plans. But their approval was tempered by frustration over the slow pace of reconstruction and by questions about who would pay. Most of the money for rebuilding will have to come from private sources, said Jim Barksdale, the chairman of the Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal established by Gov. Haley Barbour. The commission began the planning effort in mid-October. Mr. Barksdale said he hoped Congress would approve the state's request for $34 billion in relief money by Dec. 25. ''We don't know why it's taking them so long,'' Mr. Barksdale told Gulfport residents Thursday evening, adding that ''they were supposed to get it done by Thanksgiving'' under a deadline set by Congress. The plans, which are to be passed on to local officials as concepts for rebuilding, originated with a set of design workshops held in Biloxi that included about 200 architects, city planners and engineers from around the nation. Many of the designers belong to an outspoken and controversial group known as the Congress for the New Urbanism, which advocates more densely built neighborhoods with mass transit and easily walkable streets. The group's detractors say it imposes heavy-handed rules that codify a nostalgic Disney version of small-town America. Don Holden, 73, a Gulfport property owner, viewed the plans for the city on Thursday evening with dozens of other residents at a local church. Mr. Holden said he hoped the orderly development outlined in the plans would be realized, given the random style of development of the town that he had seen since 1953. Mr. Holden recalled a similar plan that emerged after Hurricane Camille struck the region in 1969. ''It wasn't like this, though,'' he said. ''We paid a lot of money for it, and it went on a shelf.'' The plans addressed some large-scale problems, like replacing a highway bridge between Biloxi and Ocean Springs, Miss., one of several major bridges destroyed in the region, and restoring fishing harbors as tourist attractions. The plans also proposed the rezoning of several downtown areas along the Gulf Coast to encourage more housing mixed with casinos, stores and restaurants. For several of the waterfront towns, one of the most significant and expensive proposals involves turning the CSX railroad that parallels the coast into a wide boulevard or corridor for light-rail trains. The idea has been studied in the past but deemed too costly, at an estimated $2 billion to acquire the land rights from the railroad. Current negotiations with CSX could bring down the cost of the rail proposal to about $500 million, said Anthony J. Topazi, president and chief executive of Mississippi Power, who led the commission's infrastructure committee. ''It is a probability that we will acquire the railroad right of way,'' Mr. Topazi said, adding that he expected a final answer from CSX officials by Feb. 3. In Gulfport, Hank Coolidge, a retired engineer, and his wife, Camilla, a retired computer analyst, noted that because the railroad rose to an elevation of about 25 feet above sea level, it formed a natural barrier several blocks north of the waterfront. The tracks helped to protect the Coolidges and other residents north of the tracks from flooding during Hurricane Katrina. ''If they tear down the tracks, the next storm surge is going to go all the way to Hattiesburg,'' Mrs. Coolidge said. Hattiesburg, Miss., lies about 70 miles north of the coast. Before unveiling the town plans to the public Wednesday evening, the governor's commission convened a group of casino owners. Twelve casinos were destroyed by the hurricane, including nine in Biloxi, putting about 14,000 people out of work. Their absence costs an estimated $500,000 a day in state and local tax revenues. In October, Governor Barbour signed a law allowing casinos to sit on land within 800 feet of the shore, no longer restricting them to offshore barges. The Miami architect Andres Duany, a principal figure in the New Urbanism movement, urged the casino owners to integrate the casinos more seamlessly among new clusters of retail stores and restaurants rather than as isolated establishments. Describing his vision, Mr. Duany said, ''You step out onto a beautiful avenue, where you can get a chance to look at the water and the marvelous sunsets and the shops, and walk up and down to restaurants and easily find taxis to other places.'' But Mr. Duany's design sharply clashed with the casino owners' main priority. ''A casino owner wants people to stay on the property,'' said Bernie Burkholder, president and chief executive of the Treasure Bay Casino, in Biloxi. ''As running-dog capitalist casino owners, we need to understand that the community fits together,'' Mr. Burkholder added, ''but we need an economic unit that will hold the customer.''"
"The city will begin demolishing several thousand of the most severely hurricane-damaged houses in the next few weeks, marking the completion of an arduous door-to-door inspection of more than 120,000 structures that began months ago. Officials here have provisionally identified about 5,500 houses as being unsafe to enter or in imminent danger of collapse. Of those, they have marked about 2,500 for demolition in the coming weeks, said Greg Meffert, the New Orleans official heading the inspections. He did not supply a precise date, but suggested that it would be soon. The highest concentration of these red-tagged houses -- so called because of the bright orange-red stickers the city's building inspectors have slapped on them -- are in the Lower Ninth Ward and Gentilly, neighborhoods ravaged by levee breaks from the storm. The water's force pushed houses in these areas off their foundations, into neighbors' yards, and sometimes collapsed them altogether. The sensitivity of demolishing houses here, a subject city officials mostly avoid discussing, is reflected in the fact that all houses tagged red are subject to a reinspection, to make certain they qualify. Some are likely to lose the red designation, city officials said, meaning that the figure of 5,500 will drop. The vast majority of the inspected houses fall into a middle, or yellow, category, meaning they have some damage -- for example, a flooded first floor -- but are still structurally sound. That so many of the city's houses sustained this degree of damage reflects the extent of the flooding, which affected 80 percent of New Orleans at its height. Lakeview, a middle-class neighborhood bordering Lake Pontchartrain, contains block after block of houses in this category and remains largely uninhabited. Many of these yellow-tagged houses ''still represent a headache for the city,'' said Bill Pioli, an official of the Army Corps of Engineers who helped manage the inspections. Salvaging them will be difficult, considering the limited resources that many homeowners and the local government have for repairs. That quandary is captured in the cautious attitude New Orleans officials are adopting toward these dwellings, neither advocating their destruction nor suggesting that all can be saved. ''The city will not be making any unilateral demolition decisions,'' Mr. Meffert, an aide to Mayor C. Ray Nagin, said in an e-mail message on Thursday. ''With the exception of those 5,000 homes that are collapsing and endangering others, the individual owner, in that yellow designation, will make the financial and personal decision of whether it makes sense to demolish or do a gut rehab.'' Heaps of housing rubble, including Sheetrock and flooring, that line many blocks here suggest that some homeowners have already made that decision and are plunging ahead with rehabilitation, despite worrisome costs. The swath of undamaged houses marked in green closely tracks the historic high ground of the city, along the Mississippi River. The elevation is imperceptible from the ground, consisting of only a few feet, and is the result of hundreds of years of silt deposited by the river. This slight rise was nonetheless just enough to keep these houses out of the ''bowl,'' as it is known locally, referring to an area largely undeveloped in the 19th century. Even before Hurricane Katrina, those areas were subject to periodic flooding during heavy rains. Out of 180,000 houses in the city, 110,000 were flooded. Half of those sat for days or weeks in more than six feet of water. The Corps of Engineers will have responsibility for the demolitions, using track excavators. But in many cases, these huge pieces of equipment will have to do little more than scoop up heaps of rubble, because wind and water have already taken care of the demolition. STORM AND CRISIS: THE CITY"
"Nineteen bodies were found on the overpass where Interstates 610 and 10 split, where they were dumped or where people died while waiting to be rescued. Nearly 80 people died in pairs, found together in or near their houses. A vast majority of the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent levee breaks in New Orleans died alone. Those were some of the details gleaned from a list of locations showing where victims' bodies had been found that Louisiana officials released yesterday. The list, which officials cautioned was incomplete and uncorrected, gave more than 800 addresses, including those of hospitals and nursing homes with multiple deaths. Unsurprisingly, many bodies were in the neighborhoods that face Lake Pontchartrain and that were inundated after floodwalls gave way: Lakeview, with 40; Gentilly, 81; and New Orleans East, 97, including 13 at the Lafon Nursing Home of the Holy Family. In the Lower Ninth Ward, where the Industrial Canal breached its levee, 72 bodies were found. The list does not distinguish between people who died because of the storm and those already dead. The highest number of bodies, 58, was at 2700 Tulane Avenue, the location of the city morgue. Thirty-nine bodies were found at the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. The list does not include the number of bodies found at Memorial Hospital, where officials confirmed finding 45 bodies two weeks after the storm. Officials with Tenet Healthcare, the hospital operator, have said about 10 of those people died before the storm. The list does appear to have inaccuracies. It says, for example, that 32 people died at 2725 Bayou Road, the address of Fernandez Nursing Home. But a spokesman for the Louisiana Health and Hospitals Department, Robert Johannessen, said there had been 32 deaths at St. Rita's Nursing Home, at 1422 East State Route 46, and not at Fernandez. The list may also indicate points where bodies were collected rather than where people died, Mr. Johannessen said. It shows, for example, that 44 bodies were at Interstate 10 and St. Charles Avenue, near the convention center, where a collection site was set up. Mr. Johannessen said the list would be revised and updated. Bodies continue to be retrieved as residents return to their houses. Some families have complained that the initial search for the dead was not thorough. Louisiana now counts 1,075 bodies among the dead from Hurricane Katrina. Mississippi had 230 deaths. The recovery and identification of the dead has been criticized as being painfully slow, with 243 bodies still unidentified. After interagency fighting over who should pay for DNA tests, the first bone samples were sent yesterday to a laboratory, Mr. Johannessen said. Of the 905 bodies examined at the central morgue set up by federal officials, 511 have been released for burial. Half of those were black, and almost all of the rest were white, according to State Health Department statistics. The latest breakdown, conducted when 488 victims had been released, showed that 248 were men and 240 were women. Most of the deaths, 360, were in New Orleans."
"He tossed his family portrait onto the trash pile as if it were a sack of kitchen scraps, and it landed on an heirloom Bible whose pages had decayed back to pulp. Nearby were ruined videos -- of Thanksgivings, his daughter's birthdays, trips to Disney World -- and old records that he had danced to with his wife. He was able to make out the label on only one, Stevie Wonder's cover of ''We Can Work It Out,'' and he almost smiled. After weeks of visiting his heavily damaged home, James Jackson had finally begun coring it out and throwing his family's possessions away. On his curb grew one of the countless personal junkyards that have sprung up across New Orleans. Any of them could be adorned with the same epitaph: Here lie memories of life before Hurricane Katrina. ''That's 20 years of stuff, and it's all gone,'' said Mr. Jackson, 43, an administrator at the local transit authority whose home is in the hard-hit Gentilly neighborhood. ''Now I have to start from zero. There was a sense of denial about doing this before I started, but then I had to face the reality that this was me and not somebody else on TV.'' If you are wondering how the people of New Orleans are faring these days, you might try the following: look around your living room and imagine that everything in it is slathered in mud and mold. Now consider what it would be like to don all manner of masks and other gear in order to go in there like a demolition worker and get rid of every last thing. For some residents, only when they are carrying out this grim ritual do they come to terms with what the hurricane has wrought. They never know what will stir poignant or pungent thoughts. At her home on Hope Street in Gentilly, Carol Hilliard, 56, found nine pairs of shoes that she had worn to Mardi Gras parties, including a beloved pair decorated with orange beads, and had trouble holding back tears. She said goodbye to her Asian vases, a coffee table with wrought iron flowers that her daughter gave her, a collection of ceramic chickens and a blouse with polka dots. ''That color always gave me a lot of satisfaction,'' Ms. Hilliard said. ''This is horrific for me just looking at this,'' she said. ''It's just things, but it's just things that meant something to me.'' Every once in a while, Ms. Hilliard rummaged through the trash pile, hoping to salvage something, second-guessing herself about what could be cleaned. She picked up pieces of clothing, sighed, then threw them back. One landed next to a rusty can of water-repellent spray. She fretted about how long the pile would be in front of her house, hoping that sanitation workers would come by soon and take it away. The longer it lingered, she said, the more it would depress her. Ms. Hilliard wandered back into her home in something of a daze, returning to nooks in hopes of finding objects that had been jostled out of place by the floodwater. Her friend Steve Banks, 51, scooped up a glinting object off the floor and handed it to her. ''Oh, my ring!'' she said. ''Where did you find it?'' Before Ms. Hilliard left for the day, she went to her attic and found a box of Christmas lights and a wreath, which she hung out front. It did little to cheer Mr. Banks's wife, Kim. ''Hopelessness on Hope Street,'' Ms. Banks, 48, grumbled. Some people have hired workers to help clear out furniture, boxes and other large objects. Ms. Hilliard paid one $1,800 to do so. The workers tend to throw out every last thing, making it necessary for the homeowners to spend even more time going through the piles in search of keepsakes. Frank Pons, 71, and his wife, Judy, 59, were spotted recently in front of their home in another hard-hit neighborhood, Lakeview, looking through the trash for a geology pick from his days as a student at Louisiana State University. They came across an exercise chair, a bundt pan in which Ms. Pons liked to bake blueberry pound cake and several books on fishing. But no pick. ''This is just your whole life,'' Ms. Pons said. ''There it is in a pile. It's hard. It doesn't even seem real anymore.'' Mr. Pons seemed less sentimental. He chuckled a bit as he pointed out to his wife that before the hurricane, she had wanted him to winnow a lot of his things anyway. Asked what he was feeling, he replied: ''Really, nothing. We're moving forward. I frankly am somewhat detached. It's kind of strange. I don't even want to go through it anymore. It's just junk.'' Mr. Jackson, the transit administrator, who was clearing out his home in Gentilly himself, wavered in his emotions. When he threw out several models of buildings at Disney World in Florida, he recalled his many visits there -- he is a Disney fanatic -- and realized that another might lift his spirits. ''Sometimes, I get a rush of energy, and I say, 'Everything is going to be all right,' '' he said. ''Other times, I want to cry. It's just a stir of emotions going round and round.'' At another home in Gentilly, Alvin Hadley, 61, and his wife, Audrey, 58, were also doing their own excavation, and both kept stumbling across things that reminded them of their children -- elementary school photos, report cards from St. Augustine High School, a baseball mitt that made Mr. Hadley think of how small his son once was. From the trash pile, Mr. Hadley rescued two military hats from his service in Vietnam, and an album with photos of him in uniform. ''This is me,'' he said, pointing to one. ''It may not look like me. See how skinny I was?'' Then he seemed to steel himself and resolved to get back to work. ''You don't have time to sit and reminisce,'' he said. ''You just have to throw stuff away. Fortunately, we didn't drown, and we can replace all this. We just have to move on.''"
"To the Editor: Re ''Gulf Planning Roils Residents'' (House & Home, Dec. 8): As one of the authors of the plan for the reconstruction of Biloxi, I can tell you that our proposals call for cleanup, a preservation focus, and traditional neighborhood reconstruction as the top three priorities. After cleanup, the very first thing to do is: ''Establish a set of criteria to assess damaged buildings that favor their preservation and consider demolition as a last resort. Halt all arbitrary demolition.'' Next comes traditional neighborhood reconstruction: ''Restore the fabric of single family houses on existing lots, in a range of traditional Mississippi house types. Enhance neighborhood centers in places where they already exist.'' Bradford McKee missed the real story: FEMA's pending work of creating maps and rebuilding guidelines threatens to wipe out almost all of the individual homeowners from their neighborhoods. FEMA claims they will not be finished for at least a year. The delay alone is driving people away. But what FEMA's draft guidelines suggest is that a small single family home would now be unbuildable. Our country has never seen the kind or the scale of abandonment that FEMA could put in place. This disaster would be more damaging than the hurricane itself. ELIZABETH MOULE MOULE & POLYZOIDES ARCHITECTS AND URBANISTS"
"The hurricane evacuees still living in a string of flophouse motels here three months on are among the most down and out. They were the hidden underclass in New Orleans, with no steady jobs or addresses, and they will be the hardest for government officials to move into apartments. There is Deborah Eubanks, 55, who takes 18 pills a day -- for diabetes, hepatitis, asthma and depression -- and said, ''I don't have the ability to think.'' There is Cheryl Sykes, who hardly leaves her third-floor room except to take her 200-pound mastiff, Huei Duei Dobbs, to ''potty.'' And there is Melvin Allen, whose many missing teeth make him look decades older than his 48 years, and whose breath smells like a brewery long before noon. Even in states like South Carolina where only a relative handful of people remain in hotel rooms, some local officials have begun to throw up their hands at the prospect of moving the last ones out before the Feb. 7 deadline imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The people who could fend for themselves, they said, have found other accommodations; rooms are now occupied mainly by the elderly, the disabled or the mentally ill. Many others are felons whose applications for apartments are routinely rejected, or people with a string of evictions who seem to be waiting to be removed again. Many are ineligible for the rental assistance offered by FEMA, because they were essentially homeless before Hurricane Katrina. ''These are the problem children,'' said Ginger Crocker, who had worked frantically over the last week to get some 200 evacuees still in government-financed hotel rooms here to sign apartment leases backed by the local housing authority. ''These folks were dependent where they were, and they're going to be dependent here.'' A federal judge this week granted a reprieve to Ms. Crocker and her counterparts across the country, extending until Feb. 7 the deadline FEMA had set for thousands of evacuees to check out of their hotels or begin picking up the cost themselves. The acting FEMA director promised to keep paying for hotel rooms for at least two weeks after each occupant receives rental assistance from the agency or is denied. Emptying the hotels is among the thorniest problems in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, one that additional time may not solve. The challenge is greatest in Texas and Louisiana, which have more than half the estimated 40,000 remaining occupied hotel rooms and have run out of other housing options for low-income evacuees. This week the mayor of Houston announced that after placing nearly 30,000 hurricane victims in apartments, his city was full. Louisiana leaders have asked FEMA to open dormitory-style shelters. Barry Porter, executive director of the Red Cross chapter in Raleigh, N.C., predicted that many of those remaining in hotels would become homeless in their new hometowns. ''These are obviously people who have extenuating circumstances,'' Mr. Porter said. ''You can't make somebody go live in a place.'' Take, for example, Manny Davis, who celebrated his 43rd birthday at the Master's Inn here last month. Behind the door of Room 129, Mr. Davis has hung a wreath on the lamp jutting from the wall and propped a miniature Christmas tree atop the microwave. The manager is paying him $75 a pop to repaint the motel's rundown rooms. So Mr. Davis was reluctant the other day to sign a lease for an apartment 15 miles away. ''I ain't going nowhere,'' he said. ''They want to put you where they want to put you. That's too far. Why I got to go that far? How am I going to get back here?'' Since four planeloads of New Orleanians landed here, a week after the storm, Columbia has had one of the most vigorous and efficient support operations in the nation, helping resettle some 3,000 people. Only the most desperate remain in a dozen dilapidated motels, where there have been occasional arrests for prostitution, drugs and other small-time crimes since their arrival. A volunteer group, South Carolina Cares, continues to deliver hot dinners -- for $5.25 a head, courtesy of the local restaurant chain Lizard's Thicket -- to each hotel room every night. A free trolley runs by each hotel throughout the day to ferry evacuees to a help center where they can do things like apply for a loan and pick up a donated winter coat. Local and state workers have lined up 200 apartments for evacuees, and church groups are collecting furniture. This week, Ms. Crocker -- who started out running South Carolina Cares and now has a three-month contract with the state emergency management department -- led a team going motel to motel, trying to get every evacuee to sign a lease. ''In politics, in my other life, we call it knock and drag,'' said Ms. Crocker, 53, a former state legislator and administrative judge who remains an active campaigner for Democrats. ''Knock on the door and drag them down to vote. This is the same thing.'' At the Carolina Lodge, Ms. Crocker was cajoling Quincy Sexton, 71, who has suffered a burst appendix and had open-heart surgery since arriving here. ''I don't want to be signing up for a house,'' Mr. Sexton said, explaining that he planned to head home to New Orleans as soon as a doctor here approved. ''When he says, boom boom and get my medical records, I'm gone.'' Ms. Crocker pointed out that FEMA would pay for his trip if someone at the other end verified that he had a place to stay for 90 days. ''I don't care where I stay, just send me back on a plane, I'm out of here,'' Mr. Sexton said. As for when he would leave, he said, ''The day that FEMA is going to throw us out of the hotel is when.'' Canvassing the dozen hotels over six days, Ms. Crocker's team secured 131 leases, though many people signed under protest, and only after being told they were under no obligation to actually move in. Now there is the matter of getting people like Mr. Davis to make the move. ''The real problem is that many of these people have never lived in a place as nice as a hotel,'' Ms. Crocker said. ''They have cable TV and a telephone and heating and air and maid service, and we're feeding them dinner every night.'' The motels have also become makeshift communities. At the Carolina Lodge, Billy Cooper was quickly crowned mayor, and his room, No. 320, serves as a kind of city hall, with trolley schedules and FEMA schedules taped to the window. Mayor Billy, as he is known, organized evacuees at his motel to pool their food stamps, and -- using a donated grill and pots and pans he stashed in the small room -- cooked group breakfasts of eggs and grits. In October, he fried a thank-you feast for 300 volunteers. Mr. Cooper, 65, said he wanted to stay in South Carolina and start a catering company. His companion, Dolly Skinner, checked out apartment complexes this week, but they are not packing yet. Not while Mr. Sexton is waiting for his medical records, and a man named Paul is in the hospital, and Everett Simpson is without his prescriptions. ''The walls are closing in on us in here, I'm raring to go,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''But I'm not leaving until after all my people leave. I have to wait for my people to get out of here. I will not go until they go.''"
"The state's top election official recommended on Friday that New Orleans postpone its February municipal elections for as long as eight months because of the impediments created by Hurricane Katrina. ''The physical and technical obstacles are too great to overcome,'' said Secretary of State Alan Ater, whose office is in charge of elections statewide. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who will decide whether to accept the recommendation, has indicated that she is likely to agree with Mr. Ater. The recommendation came as a disappointment to Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans, who has said he eagerly awaits a verdict on his performance when voters go to the polls. A delay would also give possible opponents more time to organize and campaign against him if, as expected, he chooses to seek re-election. In a statement released Friday, the mayor said he had hoped elections would take place as scheduled, ''to bring a sense of normalcy and empowerment to our citizens.'' Nonetheless, he said he respected Mr. Ater's decision. ''I'm sure it is based upon his concern for holding a fair election,'' Mr. Nagin said. Also on the ballot will be races for sheriff and the City Council. The list of impediments to holding the Feb. 4 election is long and starts with a lack of residents. As much as 80 percent of the electorate is still living outside the city, according to estimates. In addition, nearly 300 of the city's 442 polling places were damaged, if not wiped out, after Hurricane Katrina. And because the flooding disproportionately affected black precincts, there were also doubts about whether the voting would be racially fair. ''It seemed inevitable,'' Prof. Wayne Parent, a political scientist at Louisiana State University, said when asked about Mr. Ater's decision. ''We're dealing with unprecedented conditions in New Orleans.'' Mr. Ater criticized the Federal Emergency Management Agency as failing to provide any of the $2 million his office requested to replace damaged voting machines and upgrade New Orleans's absentee voting system. He recommended that the city hold elections no later than Sept. 30, which is when Louisiana holds its next regularly scheduled statewide election."
"SEASIDE, Fla., which will be 25 years old in 2006, is America's most imitated town. With its pastel-colored houses and front porches overlooking narrow, brick-paved streets, it has influenced hundreds of communities, which combine a nostalgia for small-town life with a serious effort to reduce suburban sprawl -- and dependence on the auto -- by putting buildings close together. So popular are the ''New Urbanist'' ideas spawned at Seaside a quarter century ago that the town's designers, the Miami-based team of Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, have been called in by Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi to apply their principles to communities destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. An organization founded by the couple, the Congress for the New Urbanism, is taking the lead in making plans for rebuilding the coast. But for all its influence, Seaside has problems that other towns would hardly want to imitate. The town that in the film ''The Truman Show'' signified a perfect, self-contained world has to deal with an influx of tourists who have overloaded its streets with cars. It's even gotten to the point where Seaside's founder, Robert Davis, is considering valet parking. Plus, detractors say, Seaside has never really proved anything about how Americans want to live, because the majority of its homeowners reside in places like Mobile and Atlanta and visit only a few weeks each summer. In October, when many of those homeowners arrived for the annual owners' weekend -- a convivial get-together and a chance to discuss issues facing the town -- they were greeted by a shocking sight. Seaside's stately white beach pavilions overlooking the Gulf of Mexico were boarded up and festooned with ''keep out'' signs. Wooden stairways connecting the pavilions to beaches 40 feet below were missing. The damage occurred when Hurricane Dennis made landfall near Seaside in July, washing away about 10 feet of the dunes along the gulf. The damage to houses was minimal, a vindication of a master plan in which most buildings were kept hundreds of feet from the water. Still, Mr. Davis, Seaside's developer, who now lives much of the year in San Francisco, called the sight ''a bit unnerving.'' He added, ''We thought we had set the buildings back far enough that we had a huge dune system to absorb the shock of storms.'' Dennis left the beach far narrower than it had been, and grayer, too; much of the beach's white sand was carried off by the storm. Since the summer, two of the white-painted wooden stairways to the beach have been replaced by far less attractive metal steps that can be dismantled and stored when storms threaten the coast. BUT Seaside's problems aren't just aesthetic. For the first time, the loss of so much of the dunes has left houses closest to the ocean -- one of which is on the market for nearly $6 million -- vulnerable to erosion. ''Something has to be done,'' said Mark DuPuis, a pathologist from Atlanta and a Seaside homeowner. But what has to be done isn't exactly clear. Adding jetties and seawalls, as some have proposed, may only lead to further beach erosion. ''Everything that someone says will help, someone else believes will make things worse,'' Mr. DuPuis observed. Dave Schmit, a Georgia developer who built a house in Seaside in 2002, said: ''We've got to find a way to protect our most valuable asset. These are second homes, and people go there for the beach.'' Mr. Davis said, ''We're talking to some of the best scientists and coastal engineers we can find, and we'll get second or third opinions.'' But, he said, ''There's no perfect solution.'' Owners have rallied around Mr. Davis. Jacky Barker, who has sold real estate at Seaside for 25 years, said, ''People here haven't just bought into Seaside financially; they've bought into it emotionally.'' Owners post their names -- and the punning names of their houses -- on hand-lettered signs out front. They have been handsomely rewarded for their loyalty to Seaside. Houses that sold for $100,000 in the 1980's are now valued in the millions. The least expensive property on the market, a one-bedroom, 825-square-foot condo above a commercial building, is being offered for $825,000, about as much as a similar apartment in Manhattan. The unit is called Cork the Whine. Lee Crum, a commercial photographer who has been vacationing in Seaside for more than 20 years, said that he could not believe prices would continue to increase. Then again, he acknowledged, he has been saying the same thing since the 1980's, when lots were selling for $15,000. ''Every year,'' he said, ''I stand amazed.'' But there is evidence that prices have peaked. The town's official Web site, www.seasidefl.com, lists 22 houses -- and two building lots -- for sale. In the past, there were usually only 10 or 12 properties on the market, Ms. Barker said. Seaside houses command a steep premium over houses in the surrounding areas. Stephen Robbins, a sales agent at Seagrove on the Beach Realty, said that before the summer, houses in Old Seagrove, an enclave immediately east of Seaside, were selling for about $700 a square foot, and houses in Seaside for about $1,300 -- practically double. But, he said: ''There are no buyers in the area right now. Nothing is selling.'' Mr. Schmit, the Seaside homeowner, called the lack of sales activity ''a knee-jerk reaction to the hurricanes.'' But he added, ''I'm guessing that by next spring, buyers will return.'' At the same time, Seaside's rental program -- a source of income for a large majority of Seaside's 350 owners -- has suffered its own hurricane damage. Mr. Schmit said that there were cancellations because of the storms. The Seaside Web site now offers last-minute getaways ''starting at $199 with a next-day arrival.'' Online calendars indicated that many houses are hardly booked (though winter, when northern Florida is anything but tropical, is not Seaside's high season). Still, with the beach less appealing, Mr. DuPuis said, ''it's going to be harder for owners to earn the rental income they've come to expect.'' Hurricane damage is far from Seaside's only problem. In many ways, the town is struggling against its own success. Twenty-five years ago, Seaside occupied an otherwise deserted stretch of the Florida Panhandle (so far west it's in the Central time zone). The designers, Mr. Duany and Ms. Plater-Zyberk, didn't do anything to separate the town from the road that runs through it; after all, there was almost no traffic. Now thousands of people pass through Seaside every summer day. And many of them stop to visit its shops and restaurants. The result: cars are parked everywhere, and S.U.V.'s clog streets designed for bicycles and feet. The traffic and parking problems mean that Seaside's gulf-front homes -- one of which is on the market at $5,985,000 -- are stranded between a badly diminished beach on one side and, at peak times, a knot of traffic on the other. But Mr. Davis said congestion is a sign that Seaside has succeeded. ''All of the places in the world we want to visit -- New York, London, Paris, Rome -- they all have parking problems.'' He added, ''What we're going to have to move toward is parking management, getting people to park on the far side of town, which you can do with valet parking and better signage.'' Twenty years ago, Seaside's creators were determined to banish the auto by letting people work and shop near home. They planned to bring rich and poor together -- a possibility defeated by the dizzying appreciation in real estate prices. ''We failed miserably at maintaining affordable housing stock,'' Mr. Davis said. ''And we have no industry to speak of, except for tourism.'' But Mr. Davis sees a bright side to the town's transitory nature: ''Architects come to Seaside from all over to study town planning. They couldn't do it as effectively if we didn't have the rentals.'' Earlier this month, the Seaside Institute, founded by Mr. Davis, brought hundreds of planners and developers together to discuss, as the official program put it, ''the principles of New Urbanism and their application in the marketplace today.'' Mr. Duany was a featured speaker. The town Mr. Duany designed at the start of his career has reached an age where preservation of buildings and landscapes is an issue. Henry F. Bissell, a Key Bank executive from Atlanta who owns a house in Seaside, said that about 18 months ago, homeowners began to notice that ''the common areas, the landscaping and lighting, had started to look run-down in some areas.'' The homeowners' representatives on the town council, he said, faced the issue ''head on,'' and ''things have improved.'' Mr. Bissell said that Seaside homeowners are committed to maintaining the community -- even if the $1,600 each contributed to beach renourishment last year was washed away by Dennis. Robert Davis, he said, ''is as patient as any developer you'll ever find, and we give him the benefit of the doubt.'' The days when Seaside was the only game around are over. It now competes for rental income with numerous other communities in the area. Immediately to the west of Seaside is WaterColor, which adapted much of Seaside's aesthetic while diluting its New Urbanist principles. WaterColor covers 499 acres, to Seaside's 80. Houses at WaterColor are larger than at Seaside. They are farther apart, and most have carports. Seaside owners are counting on Mr. Davis to find ways to bring the first New Urbanist town into the 21st century. ''Seaside's got competition, and it has to keep up with the Joneses,'' Mr. DuPuis said. ''It would help,'' he added, ''if we get a couple of years without bad storms.''"
"Just in time to close out a record-setting year of ill winds, along comes Tropical Storm Zeta, in the Atlantic 1,000 miles southwest of the Azores. Meteorologists, issuing early warnings yesterday, predicted that the storm would maintain or slightly increase its strength today and then weaken as it moved west. The storm, they said, was not expected to reach land or hurricane intensity. ''It's a minimal storm,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. ''It's way out in the middle of nowhere. Nonetheless, it is a storm, and storms are rare this late in the year.'' Two thousand five has been that kind of year. The first big Atlantic blow was Tropical Storm Arlene, back in June, and by early July Dennis had whipped itself into a full-blast hurricane. Twelve more hurricanes developed, the nastiest of which, Katrina, devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast. In all, 26 named storms raged from June through November, the usual hurricane season, more than in any other year since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began keeping records in the mid-1800's. So many, indeed, that storm-namers ran through the alphabet and had to dip into the Greek alphabet. Zeta, the 27th named storm of 2005, gets the sixth Greek letter. The oceanic agency uses only 21 letters of the Roman alphabet. While record-setting, the bounty of storms fits in with the Atlantic's return to an active hurricane pattern in 1995, after decades of relative quiet. The warming of tropical waters is probably contributing to the intensity of storms, as well, climate scientists say. The latecomer Zeta may be an off-season surprise, but it is not unprecedented. In 1954, Tropical Storm Alice appeared on Dec. 30 and intensified into a hurricane. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Tropical Storm Zeta was near 25 degrees north latitude and 36.9 degrees west longitude, southwest of the Azores. It is moving northwest at about 8 miles per hour. Maximum sustained winds are reaching 50 m.p.h., with winds extending up to 85 miles from the storm's center. Analyzing the latest reports, Brian D. McNoldy, a research associate in atmospheric sciences at Colorado State University, said the storm might strengthen briefly today and then weaken rapidly early next week. Wind shears are expected to break apart its center, he said. ''Zeta probably will not be around long enough to reach land or cause any trouble,'' Mr. McNoldy said."
"The devastation of New Orleans was a disaster waiting to happen because of a significant flaw in levee design by the Army Corps of Engineers, according to preliminary findings from the official Louisiana team investigating the Hurricane Katrina flooding. The findings are included in a draft report prepared by engineers on the team. They mirror the conclusion of many outside experts: that the levee that toppled at the 17th Street Canal was built with too little regard for the inherent weakness of the soil under the canal banks. Similar conditions, the experts say, existed at the sites of the two other major levee breaches in metropolitan New Orleans. ''It should have been obvious,'' said the deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, Ivor van Heerden, the leader of the investigative group, known as Team Louisiana. Billy R. Prochaska, an engineering consultant to the team, said, ''That's our question: how could this be?'' The puzzlement is especially acute, Mr. Prochaska said, because the levee design ''was gone over by everyone'' up and down the Corps of Engineers organization, from the local level to Washington, before the levees were upgraded with flood walls in the 1980's and 90's. The Louisiana team's investigation of the levee breaches shows that the sheet piles, the interlocking sheets of steel that are driven into soil to anchor the levees and prevent a flow of water underneath them, were too shallow to prevent that flow. Tests by the Louisiana group found that sheet piles reached only 10 feet below sea level in some spots, far less than would protect the city. Corps documents dating from the time of construction show that the design was for a depth of 17 1/2 feet, but even that, the investigators say, would have been too shallow. By comparison, in spots where the levees are now being repaired, the Corps of Engineers is calling for sheet piles to be driven to a depth of 51 to 65 feet. The state manager for the Team Louisiana project, Edmond J. Preau Jr., assistant secretary of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, said the levees had failed at water levels that would have been predicted had the soil problem been recognized. The walls should never have been toppled by water levels of 11 or 12 feet, Mr. Preau said. ''You had a wall that was supposed to protect to water levels up to 14, 14 1/2 feet,'' he said. ''Water didn't get that high. The wall fell down. We want to know why.'' A spokesman for the corps acknowledged yesterday that its own sonar tests had confirmed the state's findings of 10-foot sheet pile depths, and said piles would be pulled from the ground at the 17th Street Canal within the next 10 days to measure them directly. But the spokesman, James Taylor, noted that pile depth was only one factor contributing to the strength of a levee, along with others like the levee's height and width. Another corps spokesman, Wayne Stroupe, said it was still too early to know exactly why the levees of New Orleans failed. The corps, Mr. Stroupe said, is conducting its own investigation, with a report expected at the beginning of June. He said the report would include detailed analyses of the forces that the storm actually brought to bear on the city's flood control systems. Engineers typically build structures with somewhat greater strength than is necessary for expected challenges. A design standard set by the Corps of Engineers calls for levees to be built at 130 percent of the strength needed to withstand a Category 3 hurricane, and design documents from the corps stated that the New Orleans levees would meet the standard. But the preliminary calculations by Team Louisiana suggest that the 17th Street Canal levee was actually built at 93 percent to 98 percent of that strength near the breached area -- substantially weaker than the forces of a Category 3 storm. Mr. Preau, the state manager of the team, declined to comment in detail about its draft, which was described yesterday in The Times-Picayune of New Orleans and the Baton Rouge daily, The Advocate. The draft itself was not officially released because data are still being collected and analyzed, he said. ''We don't want to release any of this until we have all of our background data completely documented,'' he said. But he also said that the final determinations, which will be released early next year, were likely to be similar to those in the draft. Another member of Team Louisiana, G. Paul Kemp, an associate professor at L.S.U. and director of the Natural Systems Modeling Group at the university's Center for Coastal, Energy and Environmental Resources, said outsiders might interpret the findings as an effort to foist blame for Louisiana's problems onto the federal government and avoid responsibility for local lapses in levee maintenance. But, Dr. Kemp argued, ''the design and construction is a process that is overseen by federal people at every step.'' He added that the ultimate goal was to find out precisely what went wrong, for the sake of future guidance."
"On a trip intended to drive home her state's urgent need for billions of dollars in additional federal aid, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana came under sharp questioning from Republican lawmakers on Wednesday about her handling of the prehurricane evacuation of New Orleans and the postflood rescue effort. In a hearing by a special House committee investigating the preparations and response to Hurricane Katrina, Republicans repeatedly asked Governor Blanco, a Democrat, why she had not ordered a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans 48 hours before the storm's landfall. An earlier evacuation, they said, might have forced poor, elderly and hospitalized people to leave the city. ''You are aggressively making an excuse when no excuse should be given,'' Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, said in one of several heated exchanges between committee members and Ms. Blanco. ''It should have been mandatory. It should have happened sooner. And I think that the fact that you don't recognize that is more troubling to me than I can express.'' Ms. Blanco fiercely defended the evacuation effort, saying it moved 92 percent of the region's population to safe ground in barely 24 hours. And she questioned whether an earlier order -- New Orleans ordered a mandatory evacuation the day before the storm hit -- would have helped, asserting that many who stayed behind believed ''they were tougher than the storm.'' The hearing came as Ms. Blanco, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans were in Washington to lobby Congress and the Bush administration to support a wide-ranging aid package. The centerpiece of their campaign is a $35 billion relief package that is likely to be offered as an amendment to a military appropriations bill. The package, which is being shepherded by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, would double a $17 billion plan for the Gulf Coast that President Bush proposed earlier this year. Mr. Cochran's measure, which is still being negotiated, includes money for people without flood insurance whose homes were damaged. It would also provide loans or grants to businesses and farms hurt by the storm. It would increase federal aid to schools that have absorbed large numbers of evacuated students. And it includes additional money for levee reconstruction. On Wednesday, Ms. Blanco tried to use her testimony to prod lawmakers to support the aid package, which may come to a vote this week. ''In light of all the money the United States has forgiven foreign debtors, in light of the billions of federal dollars poured into New York after 9/11, into California after the earthquakes, and into Florida after Andrew, surely we are entitled to no less,'' Ms. Blanco said in her opening statement. But faced with an onslaught of criticism, she later sounded a note of exasperation, telling Republicans that their focus on the evacuation seemed like ''an excuse not to help us in the future.'' On Wednesday the committee also issued a subpoena to the Defense Department for documents relating to its preparations and response to Hurricane Katrina. It rejected a Democratic proposal to subpoena the White House for similar records. Though it seems likely that Congress will approve an aid package before it adjourns for the holidays, the size of that package -- and the way it is divided between Mississippi and Louisiana -- is the focus of intense closed-door negotiations. Louisiana officials have raised concerns that Mississippi, whose governor and two senators are Republicans, will receive preferential treatment. Senate Republican officials deny that. The package also faces opposition from the Bush administration and some fiscal conservatives in Congress who say it is too expensive. Though part of the $35 billion could be paid for by reallocating some of the $62 billion in hurricane relief approved by Congress earlier this year, part of it would have to be offset by spending cuts to other programs, the White House has told Mr. Cochran. Even as Ms. Blanco made her case for additional aid, she was battered by sharp questions and biting criticism from Republicans who wondered why the state had not pre-positioned resources near flood zones or used the National Guard to force residents to evacuate. Representative Henry Bonilla, Republican of Texas, said Ms. Blanco needed to counter the image that Louisiana was ''a picture of dysfunction and confusion'' after the storm. There is ''Katrina fatigue'' across the nation that might make lawmakers hesitant to increase assistance, Mr. Bonilla said. After the hearing, Ms. Blanco told reporters: ''They are losing sympathy. And we don't need sympathy. What we need is understanding, and then we need action.''"
"Hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast families, hoping to rebuild their homes after the hurricanes using low-interest government loans, are facing high rejection rates and widespread delays at the federal agency that administers the disaster loan program. The Small Business Administration, which runs the federal government's main disaster recovery program for both businesses and homeowners, has processed only a third of the 276,000 home loan applications it has received. And it has rejected 82 percent of those it has reviewed, a higher percentage than in most previous disasters, saying that many would-be borrowers did not have incomes high enough, or credit ratings good enough, to qualify. The rejections came even though the Federal Emergency Management Agency has referred more than two million people, many of them with low incomes, to the S.B.A. to get the loans. To a large degree, that high rejection rate appears to reflect a mismatch between existing government aid programs and the large number of low-income people affected by this year's hurricanes. Despite the widespread poverty in the most damaged regions, the Small Business Administration has not adjusted its creditworthiness standards, which are roughly comparable to a bank's. In fact, the loans that have been approved appear to be flowing to wealthy neighborhoods in New Orleans but not to poor ones, according to a list of loans released by the government and mapped by The New York Times. Under the disaster loan program, homeowners can borrow up to $200,000 at low interest rates to repair houses. Owners and renters can borrow up to $40,000 to replace damaged furnishings. As of Tuesday, the agency had approved 17,463 home loans, for almost $1.2 billion, although only $62 million had been disbursed to homeowners, who must be ready to start repairs to get the money. More than 77,000 applications have been rejected. The high rejection rate and the slow processing of applications are causing concern among government officials, academic experts and homeowners. Many say the problem undermines government pledges of aid, embodied by President Bush's promise in September to ''do what it takes'' to help citizens rebuild. One such homeowner is Albertha Hastens, 55, a member of the school board in White Castle, La., which is between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Strong winds damaged the roof and tore siding off her house, Ms. Hastens said, but the Small Business Administration turned her down for a loan, citing her low income. (She receives a small stipend from the school board along with her Social Security payments.) ''It makes you tired and disgusted,'' Ms. Hastens said of her experience with the agency. ''For poor working people, you don't know what to do.'' Agency officials say they are doing their best under difficult circumstances, noting that they recently approved $44 million in home and business loans in a single day. They lay the blame for any problems on the huge size of the disaster and the small size of the agency, which has hired thousands of temporary workers to help process hurricane-related requests. ''We don't have tens of thousands of people waiting for a disaster,'' said Hector V. Barreto, the agency administrator. ''We had 800 people. Now we have 4,200 people working, most brand new.'' As for the rejection rate, agency officials say the Small Business Administration's loan program could not risk taxpayer money by lending it to people with low incomes or poor credit. ''We're just dealing with the demographics in the area,'' said Herbert L. Mitchell, the associate administrator who runs the agency's disaster assistance program. Both agency officials and some critics of the federal government say that many applicants do not really want loans, but must go through the agency's loan process -- and be rejected -- in order to be eligible for certain grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (FEMA does not dispute this but says it cannot give these grants to people who have enough money to take out loans. It gives other grants for home repair in certain circumstances, but only for up to $15,600.) The slow pace of the agency's response to the hurricanes is a reason Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York, who is the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, called on Mr. Barreto yesterday to resign. ''We have reached a point where we need to get someone who can run the office in an effective way,'' Ms. Velázquez said. ''He doesn't have what it takes at a moment of crisis.'' In addition to the problems with the homeowners program, Ms. Velázquez cited the even slower pace of loans to businesses in the Gulf Coast States. The Small Business Administration has also allowed large corporations to get $2 billion in federal contracts under the guise of being small businesses, she said, and morale at the agency is low. Responding to the criticism, Raul E. Cisneros, the agency's director of communications, said in a statement: ''Unfortunately, the current political environment in Washington, D.C., is not lacking for individuals who are anxious to throw stones. This administration is focused on helping the people of the Gulf Coast rebuild after these devastating hurricanes.'' Mr. Cisneros said the agency had passed the billion-dollar loan approval mark five weeks faster than after the hurricanes in Florida last year. But Republicans have also been critical of the agency's response. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican who is chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, has sharply questioned agency officials at two hearings. Ms. Snowe also sent members of her staff to investigate the situation at the agency's loan-processing office in Fort Worth, where they found that workers have been putting in long hours but have been hampered by management missteps and a new -- and, by some accounts, balky -- computer system. To get Small Business Administration loans, homeowners must submit applications and give the agency access to tax returns so loan officers can see if applicants have enough income available to cover the debt. The agency also sends out inspectors to check the damaged homes, and makes sure that the loans are not used for costs already covered by insurance. The agency checks applicants' credit histories and, for loans over $10,000, also requires collateral, just as home mortgage lenders would. For borrowers who could not borrow elsewhere, the interest rate is about 2.7 percent on loans that can extend for 30 years; those who do have access to other credit have to pay about 5.4 percent. For weeks, small business organizations and government officials have been criticizing the pace of similar loans the agency makes to companies; fewer than 3,000 such loans have been approved, and roughly 800 checks have been sent out, for less than $11 million. Housing is a crucial issue in the Gulf Coast States, where hundreds of thousands of houses were damaged and close to 170,000 were destroyed, according to the American Red Cross. Historically, insurance proceeds, not government programs -- and certainly not the Small Business Administration -- contributed most of the money to rebuild houses, said Mary C. Comerio, a professor of architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of a 1998 book on disaster recovery. But, Ms. Comerio added, ''There is still this expectation that the government is going to do something to make people whole.'' Indeed, less than 20 percent of Louisianans think that insurance should cover the costs of rebuilding, while more than 50 percent say that the federal government has the primary responsibilityto pay for it, according to a survey of 653 state residents released in late November by the Public Policy Research Lab at Louisiana State University. But for even the most fortunate victims of the hurricanes, it may take both insurance proceeds and a Small Business Administration loan to give them even a chance of rebuilding. Craig S. Sciambra, 34, describes himself as blessed, even though his two-year-old house in the Lakeview section of New Orleans had five feet of water inside and has been declared a total loss. He still has his job as an engineer, his wife still has her job as a certified public accountant, and they had a lot of flood insurance. Mr. Sciambra has also been approved for an S.B.A. loan and mortgage refinance. ''It would be really hard to make ends meet without it,'' he said. Many of Mr. Sciambra's neighbors have also been approved for such loans, according to a list of loans released by the agency and mapped by The New York Times. Well-off neighborhoods like Lakeview have received 47 percent of the loan approvals, while poverty-stricken ones have gotten 7 percent. Middle-class black neighborhoods in the eastern part of the city have lower loan rates, too, the data suggest, at least so far. Some residents, like Diane Fleming, 57, are in limbo. A schoolteacher who lost her home of 26 years in New Orleans East, along with most of her possessions, Ms. Fleming has been shuttling between Houston and a friend's house in New Orleans. FEMA referred her to the Small Business Administration, which said it would not make a decision about her application until she heard from her insurance company, Ms. Fleming said. ''Meanwhile,'' she said, ''I have no place to live.''"
"A new battle over Congressional access to White House files broke out Wednesday over the response to Hurricane Katrina. Mainly at issue is how President Bush and his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., responded when they received the first news from Louisiana and Mississippi of dire conditions. Since Sept. 30, Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia, chairman of the special House committee investigating the response, and Representative Charlie Melancon, Democrat of Louisiana, have been seeking from the White House ''documents or communications, including internal communications'' on the threat and government actions. At first, according to letters released by the committee, the White House said providing the documents was impractical because it would require reviewing more than 71 million e-mail messages. The committee then limited the request to communications to and from Mr. Card; Frances Townsend, the president's domestic security adviser; and their deputies and senior staff members. The deputy counsel to the president, William K. Kelley, rejected that, suggesting it would ''impinge on the separation of powers of the legislative and executive branches.'' Mr. Kelley offered in a letter on Dec. 6 ''a background briefing by one or more senior administration officials.'' Beginning with Vice President Dick Cheney's refusal to turn over records of the energy panel he directed, the White House and Congress have constantly fought over access to information. The White House says presidents need confidential and frank advice they cannot obtain if it might become public. The new confrontation arose at a hearing on Mississippi's recovery. Gov. Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a familiar figure here, said his state's ability to recover had been severely hampered by Congress's delay in approving more money. Before Mr. Barbour testified, Mr. Melancon said he would make a formal motion next week to subpoena the White House documents. Mr. Melancon recalled that Michael D. Brown, then director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told the panel that he had warned the White House before the storm that a disaster was looming and that in the immediate aftermath, he had repeatedly contacted the White House to report an out-of-control situation."
"Former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton announced $90 million in grants yesterday from the charity they established for recovery programs in the region battered by Hurricane Katrina. The grants, the first made from their foundation, will go to a variety of educational, religious and nonprofit organizations. The Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund will allocate $30 million to 34 Gulf Coast colleges and universities to help them rebuild and repair campuses, help students uprooted from school by the hurricane and pay staff members who are unable to work because of school closings. The fund is giving $20 million to an alliance of ministers led by Bishop T. D. Jakes, the pastor of one of the country's largest megachurches, Potter's House, and William H. Gray III, a minister who served in Congress and is a former leader of the United Negro College Fund. The group will distribute the money to religious organizations and churches that have been heavily involved in the relief and recovery effort. An additional $40 million will be divided among three nonprofit entities created after the storm by the governors of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to fill in gaps between federal and private financing for longer-term reconstruction and recovery programs. ''We are pleased that there is movement and that the funds will now be available to support relief and recovery,'' said James A. Joseph, chairman of the Louisiana Disaster Recovery Foundation, which distributes aid to a variety of nonprofit and charitable groups and will receive part of the $40 million. Mr. Joseph said his foundation would soon make its first grants. The Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund has raised more than $100 million and continues to attract contributions. The former presidents used the occasion to announce co-trustees for their charity. Mr. Clinton appointed Alexis M. Herman, who served as his secretary of labor from 1997 to 2001, to represent him on the board, and Mr. Bush appointed Donald L. Evans, who served as commerce secretary in the current President Bush's first cabinet."
"The debate over whether the toxic discharges that swept over New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish after Hurricane Katrina have left the area unfit for human habitation reignited on Thursday, as state environmental officials and local environmental and citizens' groups accused one another of misinterpreting data. A toxicologist for the State of Louisiana said in an interview Thursday that about 95 percent of the city was fit for long-term human habitation. A few hours earlier, representatives of local environmental and citizens' groups, citing samples the government collected from the sediment in once-flooded areas and their own samples, said at a news conference that without an extensive cleanup of toxic sediments, at least 75 percent of the city was unfit for families with children. Asked whether the city was safe enough for people to return for the long term, Tom Coleman, a Superfund specialist at the Dallas regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency working in New Orleans, replied: ''We haven't said that. And we're not going to say that. Safety is a very difficult concept. For our agency to make that declaration, that would be somewhat of an absolute, and these are not absolute situations.'' But, Mr. Coleman added, ''Within the world of chemical contamination, we're not seeing levels of contaminants that are causing us a lot of concern.'' He said there were a couple of locations that needed further study. At some level, the debate is moot, because in much of the city where the floods lingered longest there are no habitable dwellings, and no immediate prospect of restoring what is left to a condition fit to house people. Still, the mixed messages, coming on a day when one of the last neighborhoods in the city was reopened for residents to visit, reinforced the ambiguity of the situation. Two months ago, the E.P.A. administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, characterized it as one of the biggest challenges the agency had ever faced. Erik D. Olson, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said at the environmental groups' news conference that the agency was ''grossly misleading the public in the way they are representing their own data.'' At issue, Mr. Olson and other environmentalists said, are concentrations of three types of dangerous substances -- arsenic, a toxic and carcinogenic metal; a complex of chemicals generated by the incomplete combustion of petroleum products, some of which are carcinogenic; and chemicals that are the building blocks of pesticides. Arsenic, the environmental groups' representatives said, has been found all over town. The petrochemical residues were found in sediment near the Agricultural Street Landfill, a Superfund site in the city whose cleanup had nearly been complete when the hurricane struck. And the pesticide-related chemicals were found outside the fence of a former pesticide manufacturing plant. Wilma Subra, a chemist from western Louisiana who has taken the lead in collecting independent sampling data in collaboration with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network and the Jennifer Altman Foundation, an environmental and health advocacy group, said arsenic at levels 20 or more times the federal standards had been found throughout the city. But Tom Harris, a toxicologist with the Louisiana State Department of Environmental Quality, said the concentration of arsenic found in government samples, while in excess of federal standards, was in most cases roughly the same as it would have been before the hurricane, and the same as occurs naturally in many places around the country. Speaking of the hundreds of thousands of city residents now living around the region and the country, Mr. Harris said, ''Wherever they are now, they're looking at the same concentrations'' of arsenic. He conceded that toxic petrochemical substances were a worry at the Agricultural Street landfill. ''That's one of the areas we're taking a closer look at,'' he said. ''There are a small handful of locations where we're not ready to say everything's just fine and dandy.'' Mr. Harris would not specify which locations, and quickly added, ''I'm pretty comfortable with 90 percent of what I've seen.'' Like Mr. Coleman of the Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Harris said he had no quarrel with the data collected by Ms. Subra, but objected to the interpretation she and the defense council representatives have made of them. He also rejected their contention that a cleanup of toxic residues would be needed to make the city safe to live in. Asked how much cleanup would be needed, Mr. Coleman said the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Administration would make that determination, in consultation with his agency and other state and local groups."
"To better understand the potential for catastrophic damage from future hurricanes, scientists are looking to the past. And the future looks very expensive, the scientists said this week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union. With wealth and property values increasing, and more people moving to vulnerable coasts, by the year 2020 a single storm could cause losses of $500 billion -- several times the damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina. Roger A. Pielke Jr., director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado, presented preliminary results of a study that retraced the path of hurricanes from the past 105 years and calculated the havoc they would wreak on the present-day United States landscape. Dr. Pielke said the traditional way of looking at the damage inflicted by past hurricanes -- calculating the value of property destroyed and adjusting for inflation -- was misleading. ''Something else is going on,'' he said. ''That something else is society is changing underneath.'' Using a database of information about property and people in 168 counties along the Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern Seaboard, Dr. Pielke and his collaborators, Christopher Landsea of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Joel Gratz of the University of Colorado, calculated the damage that would occur today from the winds and storm surges of past hurricanes. Their numbers, all adjusted for inflation to 2004 dollars, generally do not include damage from inland flooding. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans and southwestern Mississippi in August, is No. 2 on the list, with an estimated $80 billion in damage. The researchers plan to refine their numbers on this year's hurricanes before publishing their study. No. 1 is a storm that received little attention in the historical comparisons that followed Hurricane Katrina: the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926. Similar to Hurricane Katrina in size and ferocity, it caused about $760 million in damage, in 2004 dollars. But if a hurricane of that magnitude followed the same track today, it would leave behind $130 billion of devastation across a Miami area that is far more crowded than it was in 1926, the scientists said. Similarly, the hurricane that hit Galveston, Tex., in 1900 would cause $53 billion in damage today, and Hurricane Andrew, which caused a record $25.5 billion in damage when it hit Florida in 1992, would cause $51 billion in damage if it hit today. The study is an update of similar calculations that Dr. Pielke and Dr. Landsea published in 1998. In that study, they found that a storm on the scale and path of the Great Miami Hurricane would cause $63 billion in damage, in 1998 dollars. The doubling in losses, to $130 billion now, largely reflects a growing population and greater individual wealth. ''I was quite surprised at the magnitude of increase of losses,'' Dr. Pielke said. ''Not only are there more people, but they all have more possessions.'' If current trends continue, a Great Miami Hurricane would cause $500 billion in damage in 2020 -- the rise consisting only of additional property, not any consideration of inflation. Dr. Pielke said he hoped the numbers would help officials make decisions about how to rebuild from hurricane damage and help them understand that disasters of similar magnitude were all too likely in the future. ''This is not a one-off type of event,'' he said. ''It's not just Katrina.''"
"Under pressure from state and local leaders who say they cannot move thousands of hurricane evacuees from hotels into longer-term housing by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Dec. 15 deadline, officials said Saturday that FEMA would continue paying hotel bills, on a case-by-case basis, for at least three more weeks. The new program, which FEMA plans to announce Monday, will require evacuees to obtain an authorization number by calling 1-800-621-FEMA and explaining why they still need help. Evacuees who have not registered with FEMA or received rental assistance from the agency or who have spent FEMA checks for items other than housing while staying in a hotel will be eligible. These individual extensions apply to people staying in an estimated 2,400 rooms in 38 states, where FEMA plans to discontinue blanket payments as of Thursday. FEMA already promised to pick up the tab through Jan. 7 for the 10 states with the most evacuees in their hotels. ''This is really creating a safety net,'' said Donna Dannells, FEMA's acting deputy director of recovery. ''There's never been any intent for someone to be left without the resources to pay for the hotel room or to go and find a place to live.'' She said the extension program was partly intended to help FEMA better track the hotel residents. The hotel program, which has cost the federal government $325 million so far and at its peak covered 85,000 rooms, has caused much confusion and controversy for FEMA, which originally said last month that it would cut off financing for most rooms by Dec. 1, only to reverse course a week later and set the Dec. 15 and Jan. 7 deadlines."
"Hector V. Barreto, the head of the Small Business Administration, defended his agency's response to the Gulf Coast hurricanes on Thursday on Capitol Hill, saying the agency had responded ''quicker to this event than any in our history.'' But amid evidence of growing backlogs and high rates of rejection in the agency's disaster loan program to businesses and homeowners, Democrats attacked his performance. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued a scathing statement accusing Mr. Barreto of offering small businesses in the gulf region ''only hurricane-force spin,'' rather than real assistance. Government officials and business organizations have complained that the agency has approved only a small number of low-interest business loans -- fewer than 3,000 as of Dec. 13, according to the agency's own data. Almost 7,000 business loan applications have been rejected, and more than 27,000 are pending. The backlog is far larger for homeowners who have applied for loans. The New York Times reported on Thursday that more than 175,000 applications -- almost two-thirds of those the agency had received -- had not yet been processed. More than 81 percent of the applications that have been processed were rejected. To support his argument that the agency had moved quickly to respond to the hurricanes, Mr. Barreto said at a news conference that his agency had approved $1 billion in loans just as fast as it had in 1994, when the Northridge earthquake struck Southern California. But some critics of the agency contend that computer processing has improved significantly in the last decade, adding that the agency was slow back then, too. As he has in the past, Mr. Barreto attributed the agency's high rejection rate to the high poverty levels in the areas struck by the hurricanes. ''We're being as lenient as possible within the limits of our authority,'' he said of the loan programs. Mr. Barreto said 80 percent of loan applications were from people who did not want to borrow money, but who had to be rejected by his agency before they could seek additional grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA referred more than two million families to Mr. Barreto's agency based on the incomes they reported when they registered for federal assistance. Mr. Barreto made his comments at a news conference called by the chairman of the House Small Business Committee, Representative Donald Manzullo, Republican of Illinois. Critics of the Small Business Administration were actually dissatisfied, Mr. Manzullo said, because it offered loans, which must be repaid, rather than grants. As for the speed of the loan process, Mr. Manzullo pointed to the agency's experience in New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when businesses complained of a slow pace in lending ''despite the fact that S.B.A. workers went out of their way to provide assistance.'' But twice as many of those businesses defaulted on their loans as in previous disasters, Mr. Manzullo said, so if loans are made quickly ''and you try to satisfy complainers, you have a huge default rate.'' Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House committee, repeated her call for Mr. Barreto to resign. ''This administration has failed small businesses across the country and particularly at a moment of crisis,'' she said at a separate news conference. Ms. Velázquez criticized what she said was the agency's decision to change its computer system just before the hurricane season began, and also its promotion of a loan program offered through banks. The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce issued a statement on Thursday defending Mr. Barreto, saying that ''politically motivated attacks leveraged against Administrator Barreto undermine the hard work of a dedicated public servant.''"
"The Bush administration agreed on Thursday to double what it would spend on flood protection for New Orleans, promising a system that it said would make the city safe from catastrophic flooding from a storm as powerful as Hurricane Katrina. At a briefing at the White House, the coordinator of the federal response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Donald E. Powell, said the government would add $1.5 billion to the $1.6 billion already promised for the levees. The protection, Mr. Powell said, will ''be better and stronger'' than ever and encourage homeowners and businesses to return. ''I'm convinced that what we're doing here today, if there is another Katrina that hits New Orleans, that we would not see the catastrophic results that we saw during Katrina,'' he said. Mr. Powell added that there could still be ''manageable type'' flooding. The plan, to be completed within two years, fell far short of the protection against Category 5 hurricanes that Louisiana leaders have said is vital to rebuild New Orleans and that could cost more than $30 billion. Outside engineering experts said the plan might protect against storms of Hurricane Katrina's strength, but not necessarily bigger ones. Hurricane Katrina had been a Category 5 in the Gulf of Mexico but was at Category 4 at most when it made landfall near Buras, La., 55 miles south-southeast of New Orleans. The administration commitment was welcomed as an important first step by elected officials from Louisiana, including Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans, who was at the White House, and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who was in Washington to push for billions in storm relief. The two officials said the announcement would provide a psychological comfort level to residents worried about the next storm. ''I want to say to all New Orleanians, to all businesses, 'It's time for you to come home,' '' Mr. Nagin said. ''We now have the commitment and the funding for hurricane protection at a level that we have never had before.'' Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said it was ''just the first step of about 10 that we need to take.'' Governor Blanco called it a ''down payment'' and said the plan would upgrade the levees to a ''true Category 3 level.'' The administration has come under mounting criticism that federal agencies have been slow to respond to the plight of people along the Gulf Coast and that Washington has been slow to make good on President Bush's promise to oversee ambitious rebuilding. The levee announcement was issued as the White House was negotiating with lawmakers from the Gulf Coast and Republican Congressional leaders on a $35 billion package to aid homeowners, businesses, schools, local governments and farmers. The levee reconstruction would be part of that package, which negotiators are trying to attach to a Defense Department appropriations bill that Congress has to vote on before adjourning in a few days. Even before the announcement, the White House had put forth a plan to allocate $17 billion for Gulf Coast reconstruction. It has balked at a plan by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, to double that sum. Mississippi and Louisiana have been seeking additional aid for businesses and homeowners without flood insurance, as well as for schools that have enrolled large numbers of evacuated students. Louisiana has also asked Congress to waive $3.7 billion it is expected to owe the Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster response and to cover 100 percent of its Medicaid costs for displaced people. The administration sidestepped questions about whether the improvements would allow the levees to deal with the strongest hurricanes, Categories 4 and 5. Mr. Powell said the plan would substantially improve the levees by raising them in places to compensate for subsidence and fortifying them with stone and concrete. ''Once this is complete,'' he said, ''the levee system will be better, much better, and stronger than it ever has been in the history of New Orleans.'' The program calls for closing three canals that contributed to the flooding and installing a more powerful pumping system along Lake Pontchartrain. Experts in flood control have long argued that the canals, dug more than a century ago through marshland, now introduce miles of vulnerability deep into city neighborhoods. Installing concrete and stone at the bases of the levees would protect the surrounding soil from being scoured away if water washed over the floodwalls. Scouring can undermine the levees from underneath, leading to collapse, in the same way water from Lake Borgne destroyed miles of the eastern levee systems in Hurricane Katrina. A system fortified against scouring can have water flow over the top without being breached, so the protected areas are flooded only briefly and drainage can occur. Thomas F. Wolff, associate dean for undergraduate studies at the college of engineering at Michigan State University, who has helped investigate the levee failures, said that the added $1.5 billion had ''significantly improved'' the response to the disaster and that closing the canals was long overdue. ''I would still have some questions as to whether that is a complete solution and provides Category 5 protection,'' Mr. Wolff added. Louis Capozzoli, a consulting engineer on the Louisiana team that is investigating the levees, said the sum being discussed was too little. ''I think they're off by an order of magnitude,'' Mr. Capozzoli said. ''That's not going to come close to protecting New Orleans, let alone the other areas'' in southern Louisiana. Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said he received assurances on Thursday from Karl Rove, President Bush's closest political adviser, that the administration was prepared to pay for the levee improvements even if the cost exceeded $3.1 billion. Asked whether they were satisfied with the safety level under the program, Louisiana officials noted that the budget included money for a study on whether more needed to be done. ''Currently, there's no science to go higher than what they're doing today,'' Mayor Nagin said. Mr. Vitter and Ms. Landrieu also said they would continue to push for legislation to give Louisiana as much as $3 billion a year in revenues from offshore oil drilling that currently go to the federal government. They have proposed that the money be dedicated to restoring coastal wetlands and constructing Category 5 hurricane protection, projects that could cost more than $30 billion. On Thursday, a White House official provided a two-hour closed-door briefing to members of a select House committee that is investigating the preparations for Hurricane Katrina and response to it. Republicans said they considered the briefing, by Mr. Bush's deputy domestic security adviser, Ken Rapuano, candid and helpful. Democrats said the briefing failed to answer major questions about the handling of the disaster, and they renewed their call for the committee to subpoena records from Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, and other senior officials. The Republican majority has already rebuffed that call once."
"The airline industry felt the brunt of Hurricane Katrina yesterday, with some airports running low on jet fuel and carriers canceling hundreds of flights. Meanwhile, Wall Street feared that the financial problems of the sickest airlines could grow worse. The industry's trade group, the Air Transport Association, said the nation's supply of jet fuel had been cut 13 percent because of damage to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The association arranged for supplies of jet fuel to be shipped by air tanker to airports in Charlotte, N.C., and Fort Myers and West Palm Beach in Florida, where supplies had dwindled, the group's chief economist, John Heimlich, said yesterday. The group also planned to send jet fuel by tanker truck as well as plane to other airports, Mr. Heimlich said. Of particular concern are supplies at two big airports --Hartsfield, serving Atlanta, and Dulles, serving Washington. Both airports generally rely on supplies from refineries in Louisiana and in Memphis. Complicating matters is the coming Labor Day weekend, which wraps up the summer travel season and is generally the last period of strong travel for the airlines until Thanksgiving. Car travel is also heavy then. And with gasoline selling for upward of $3 a gallon in some parts of the country, versus $1.88 for jet fuel, Mr. Heimlich said the airlines were worried that refineries might choose to produce gasoline rather than jet fuel, which would be less in demand. Yesterday, airports serving New Orleans and Gulfport-Biloxi in Mississippi remained closed, while operations at the airport in Jackson, Miss., were curtailed. The Federal Aviation Administration said it expected operations to resume in New Orleans today, although it could not predict when Gulfport-Biloxi would reopen. Despite the reopening, some airlines, like United, canceled flights to New Orleans through tomorrow; US Airways canceled flights there through Saturday. Delta Air Lines said it had canceled as many as 300 flights throughout the South, and AirTran, a low-fare carrier, said it had canceled about 190 since the weekend. But industry analysts said the cancellations would not hurt the airlines' finances, since they could accommodate those passengers eventually. The bigger concern, they said, was another rise in jet fuel prices, already at the highest level in history, up 53 cents a gallon this year. Contracts based on the future price of jet fuel spiked yesterday; in Los Angeles, usually the most expensive market across the country for jet fuel, the price closed at $2.24 a gallon. That is a particular worry for Delta, which has warned it could seek bankruptcy protection because of a cash squeeze. The airline has said each rise of a penny in the price of jet fuel costs it $25 million. With jet fuel prices up 53 cents so far this year, Delta is paying $1.35 billion more for fuel than it anticipated. Airline shares fell yesterday. Delta shares was down 7 cents, to $1.20. Northwest lost 25 cents, to $4.94, and AMR, the parent of American, dropped 71 cents to $12.69. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE AIRLINES"
"A day after New Orleans thought it had narrowly escaped the worst of Hurricane Katrina's wrath, water broke through two levees on Tuesday and virtually submerged and isolated the city, causing incalculable destruction and rendering it uninhabitable for weeks to come. With bridges washed out, highways converted into canals, and power and communications lines inoperable, government officials ordered everyone still remaining out of the city. Officials began planning for the evacuation of the Superdome, where about 10,000 refugees huddled in increasingly grim conditions as water and food were running out and rising water threatened the generators. The situation was so dire that late in the day the Pentagon ordered five Navy ships and eight Navy maritime rescue teams to the Gulf Coast to bolster relief operations. It also planned to fly in Swift boat rescue teams from California. As rising water and widespread devastation hobbled rescue and recovery efforts, the authorities could only guess at the death toll in New Orleans and across the Gulf Coast. In Mississippi alone, officials raised the official count of the dead to at least 100. ''It looks like Hiroshima is what it looks like,'' Gov. Haley Barbour said, describing parts of Harrison County, Miss. Across the region, rescue workers were not even trying to gather up and count the dead, officials said, but pushed them aside for the time being as they tried to find the living. As the sweep of the devastation became clear, President Bush cut short his monthlong summer vacation on Tuesday and returned to Washington, where he will meet on Wednesday with a task force established to coordinate the efforts of 14 federal agencies that will be involved in responding to the disaster. The scope of the catastrophe caught New Orleans by surprise. A certain sense of relief that was felt on Monday afternoon, after the eye of the storm swept east of the city, proved cruelly illusory, as the authorities and residents woke up Tuesday to a more horrifying result than had been anticipated. Mayor Ray Nagin lamented that while the city had dodged the worst-case scenario on Monday. Tuesday was ''the second-worst-case scenario.'' It was not the water from the sky but the water that broke through the city's protective barriers that changed everything for the worse. New Orleans, with a population of nearly 500,000, is protected from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain by levees. North of downtown, breaches in the levees sent the muddy waters of the lake pouring into the city. Streets that were essentially dry in the hours immediately after the hurricane passed were several feet deep in water on Tuesday morning. Even downtown areas that lie on higher ground were flooded. The mayor said both city airports were underwater. Mayor Nagin said that one of the levee breaches was two to three blocks long, and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been dropping 3,000-pound sandbags into the opening from helicopters, as well as sea-land containers with sand, to try to seal the break. Late Tuesday night, there were reports that the rising waters had caused a nearby station that pumps water out of the city to fail. New Orleans is below sea level, and the mayor estimated that 80 percent of the city was submerged, with the waters running as deep as 20 feet in some places. The city government regrouped in Baton Rouge, 80 miles to the northwest. Col. Terry Ebbert, the city's director of homeland security, said the rushing waters had widened one of the breaches, making the repair work more difficult. While the bulk of New Orleans's population evacuated before the storm, tens of thousands of people chose to remain in the city, and efforts to evacuate them were continuing. The authorities estimated that thousands of residents had been plucked off rooftops, just feet from the rising water. ''The magnitude of the situation is untenable,'' said Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana. ''It's just heartbreaking.'' Looting broke out as opportunistic thieves cleaned out abandoned stores for a second night. In one incident, officials said, a police officer was shot and critically wounded. ''These are not individuals looting,'' Colonel Ebbert said. ''These are large groups of armed individuals.'' Officials at the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security confirmed that officials in Plaquemines and Jefferson Parishes had tried to call for martial law, which is not authorized by the State Constitution. Offering up howling winds of as much as 145 miles an hour, the hurricane hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m. Monday as a Category 4 storm, the second-highest rating, qualifying it as one of the strongest to strike the United States. Preliminary damage estimates from insurance experts on Monday ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion, but they were pushed up past $25 billion on Tuesday, which could make Hurricane Katrina the costliest in history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew in 1992, with $21 billion in insured losses. As the scope of the damage to oil and gas facilities in the Gulf of Mexico became more apparent, energy prices rocketed to record highs. Experts predicted that further increases were likely. Floodwaters were still rising as much as three inches an hour in parts of New Orleans late Tuesday. In other areas, they were beginning to subside. ''I don't want to alarm anyone that New Orleans is filling up like a bowl,'' Michael Brown, FEMA's director, said. ''That isn't happening.'' More than 10,000 people remained stranded in the Louisiana Superdome, which was without power and surrounded by three to four feet of water. Swaths of the roof had been peeled away by the powerful winds, and it was stifling inside without air conditioning. Toilets were reported to be overflowing. A woman with an 18-month-old baby said her last bottle of baby formula was nearly empty. During the day, additional survivors were deposited at the Superdome by rescuers, but the absence of food and power, not to mention the water lapping at the doors, made their continued stay perilous. Hundreds of critically-ill patients had to be evacuated out of Charity Hospital and Tulane University Hospital because of the flooding. At Tulane, they were removed by helicopter from the roof of a parking garage. The staff of the Times-Picayune, which was able to publish only an online version of its edition on Tuesday, was forced to flee the paper's offices. The Coast Guard estimated that about 1,200 people had been rescued Monday and thousands more on Tuesday. Efforts were hindered by phone and cellphone service being out in much of the city. Getting food and water into the city was an urgent priority. Officials said that there was only one way for emergency vehicles to get into parts of the city to bring in supplies. ''We're racing the clock in terms of possible injury,'' said Michael Chertoff, the national homeland security secretary. ''We're racing the clock in terms of illness, and we're racing the clock to get them food and water.'' The hurricane, downgraded to a tropical depression by late Tuesday morning, continued to putter along into adjoining states, though its teeth were gone. It had left its mark on numerous Gulf Coast communities. In Mississippi, for example, Gulfport was virtually gone, and Biloxi was severely damaged. From the air, New Orleans was a shocking sight of utter demolition. Seen from the vantage point of a Jefferson Parish sheriff's helicopter transporting FEMA officials, vast stretches of the city resembled a community of houseboats. Twenty-block neighborhoods were under water as high as the roofs of three-story houses. One large building, the Galleria, had most, if not all, of its 600 windows blown out. Sections of Interstate 10, the principal artery through the city, had pieces missing or misaligned, as if the highway were an unfinished jigsaw puzzle. Parts of the 24-mile-long Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, the world's longest overwater highway bridge, were missing as well. Fires had broken out in sundry buildings, and hundreds of thousands of people were without power. One woman swam from her home on Monday and then walked through the night to take shelter in a 24-hour bar in the French Quarter. Another left her flooding house but could not persuade her elderly roommate to come with her. Her roommate insisted, ''God will take care of me.'' People waded through waist-high water, looking to determine the fate of their homes. Rescue workers, who were plucking people off roofs in rescue cages, reported seeing bodies floating through the water. Mayor Nagin said that as he flew over the city he saw bubbles in the water, which he said seemed to signify natural gas leaks. The mayor estimated it would be one to two weeks before the water could be pumped out, and two to four weeks before evacuees could be permitted back into the city. Another city official said it would be two months before the schools reopened. Tens of thousands of people are expected to need temporary homes for uncertain durations. The authorities were looking at renting apartments, putting people up in trailers and establishing floating dormitories. Parishes east of the city were also battered. The president of Plaquemines Parish, on the southeastern tip of Louisiana, announced that the lower half of the parish had been reclaimed by the river. St. Bernard Parish, adjacent to New Orleans, was largely rooftops and water. In South Diamondhead, Miss., on St. Louis Bay, all that remained of the entire community of 200 homes was pilings. Boats were stuck in trees. ''Yeah, we caught it,'' said Randy Keel, 46. ''We basically got what we're wearing.'' Everyone was ''walking around like zombies,'' Mr. Keel said. Some Mississippi casinos, which had been floating on barges, were swept half a mile inland. An oil platform in the gulf was transported within a hundred yards of Dauphin Island, the barrier island at the south end of Mobile County, Ala., and much of that island was underwater. Peter Teahen, the national spokesman for the American Red Cross, said: ''We are looking now at a disaster above any magnitude that we've seen in the United States. We've been saying that the response is going to be the largest Red Cross response in the history of the organization.'' Meanwhile, the evacuated survivors tried to accept the images they saw on television. Vonda Simmons, 39, fled New Orleans with relatives on Saturday afternoon to stay with friends in Baton Rouge. When she saw footage of the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward, where she lived, she assumed she had lost everything but she accepted fate's hand. ''We have the most prized possession,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''We have each other.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 2, 2005, Friday Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Wednesday about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina misstated the day that President Bush returned to Washington from his vacation to meet with a task force coordinating disaster response. It was Wednesday, not Tuesday. Correction: September 20, 2005, Tuesday A front-page article on Aug. 31 about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina misattributed a statement about the severity of flooding in New Orleans. It was Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, who said, ''I don't want to alarm anyone that New Orleans is filling up like a bowl'' -- not Michael D. Brown, who was director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency."
"As a member of the national catastrophe team at Allstate Insurance, Bill Mellander follows hurricanes for a living. And Katrina looks different from other hurricanes he has seen. ''The thing that sticks out so dramatically is the extent of the flooding,'' said Mr. Mellander, whose job is to swoop into disaster areas to help evaluate damage and share information with the news media. New Orleans, in particular, ''is essentially a giant bathtub,'' he said. If flooding -- rather than strong winds -- turns out to be responsible for most of the damage caused by Katrina, many displaced homeowners may be in for more frustration. While most have insurance that protects them against wind damage, such insurance rarely covers floods. Homeowners must buy flood protection separately. ''A lot of people who live in flood zones have homeowners insurance but don't have flood insurance,'' said J. Robert Hunter, insurance director for the Consumer Federation of America. ''If a flood hasn't happened in an area in a long time, people tend not to think about it.'' In many of the Louisiana counties hit hardest by Katrina, less than half of households are covered for floods, according to an analysis of federal data by The New York Times. In Orleans Parish, which includes New Orleans, and in St. Tammany Parish, roughly 4 in 10 households are covered. But in St. Bernard Parish and Jefferson Parish, 57 percent of households bought flood protection. In Mississippi, the picture is far different. In Hancock County, 1 in 4 households are insured against flooding. In Jackson and Harrison Counties, the number is 1 in 10. As they try to scrape together the money to rebuild, homeowners may find themselves wrangling with their insurers, Mr. Hunter said. ''What the insurance companies have learned is that it's good to pay out money at the beginning, particularly when the TV cameras are rolling,'' he said. ''The haggling will probably come a few months from now when you're trying to get an offer that you think is fair for what you think you've lost.'' Bill Bailey, managing director of the hurricane information center of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, gave a different reason for companies' seeming to favor early claims. ''If it's valid, and if you have enough to back up your claim, it's settled very quickly,'' he said, adding that 90 percent of the 700,000 claims filed after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 were settled within six months. But later, ''you reach that cadre of people who are going to be more resistant to settlement and are going to hold out for their figure.'' Proving wind damage versus flood damage can be tricky, said Donald F. Thorpe, a senior insurance analyst at the credit rating agency Fitch Ratings. He offered a hypothetical case: A hurricane blows off the roof of a home and then 15 inches of rain falls in the living room. That loss typically should be covered by hurricane protection, he said. But some insurers may refuse to attribute that flooded living room to the absent roof. After all, ''if the rain just comes through the floor, that would not be insured,'' he explained. ''So there's a fairly high risk of disputes. Then you have to bear the loss yourself -- that could be significant for people.'' Insurers may also be able to save on claims because flood coverage is financed by the government, through a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Regardless of how disputes are settled, Katrina could still rank among the costliest storms on record. Eqecat, a risk management firm based in Oakland, Calif., predicted on Monday that insured losses -- which would exclude federal flood insurance -- would total $9 billion to $16 billion. ''That's big,'' Mr. Thorpe of Fitch Ratings said. ''That's the largest insured loss since Sept. 11.'' Hurricane Andrew, which struck in August 1992, was the costliest hurricane in American history, with nearly $21 billion in insured losses, in 2004 dollars, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The Consumer Federation of America said it was conservatively estimating that homeowners would file 150,000 federal flood insurance claims for $6 billion. But Mr. Mellander of Allstate, speaking from a sugar-cane field near Baton Rouge, La., said it was too early to estimate the losses. After all, the muddy waters obscuring cars and windows are still rising and could take weeks to recede. HURRICANE KATRINA: INSURANCE"
"Hundreds of thousands of evacuees from the New Orleans area stranded in overcrowded hotels, motels and makeshift shelters and on highways across much of the South underscored a new reality on Tuesday: an extended diaspora of a city's worth of people, one rarely seen in the annals of urban disaster. As news spread that the devastated, largely emptied and cordoned-off New Orleans area would not be habitable until at least next week, hurricane refugees gathered in hotel lobbies and shelters around television sets beaming images of their waterlogged city and turned to cellphones and laptops, usually in vain, for information about the homes, relatives and neighbors they had left behind. Hotels as far away as Houston (350 miles from New Orleans), Memphis (395 miles) and Little Rock (445 miles) were booked, and the American Red Cross had opened more than 230 shelters in schools, churches and civic centers spread through six Southern states. Many found themselves wandering anew after maxing out credit cards or being forced to leave previously booked rooms. America Williams, 34, evacuated on Sunday, piling into a sport utility vehicle with her boyfriend and 13 of his relatives -- seven of them children. ''They just told us to drive, to drive east or west to get as far from the storm as possible,'' Ms. Williams said. ''Our intention was to go to Atlanta, but it was raining so hard we stopped in Birmingham.'' After two nights in three $50 rooms at a motel, the family ran out of money and moved on Tuesday to the Birmingham Jefferson Civic Center, where the Red Cross had just opened a shelter. ''We're down to our very last,'' Ms. Williams said. ''We came here for some type of assistance, some type of help.'' One woman spent much of the day in her car on the side of the highway here in Saraland, just north of Mobile, since her car radio was the most reliable source of information in a region where electricity remained spotty. An extended family holed up at a hotel in Lafayette, La., sent a scouting mission to Baton Rouge in search of rental property in case they remain stranded for weeks. ''We're getting almost a second shift of refugees who are trying to find new spots from the original place where they've come from,'' said Brady Warner, coordinator of a Red Cross shelter in Baytown, Tex., the second of three to open in the Houston area. ''People are very comfortable and very happy, but they'd also really like to go home.'' Sandra and Robert Allums, from Metairie, La., said they evacuated on Sunday with just some insurance papers and clothes for a few days. They booked a room at the Hampton Inn here in Saraland, but with no electricity at the hotel and no cellphone service, they retreated to their car for its air-conditioned comfort and its radio for information. They said local radio call-in shows were the best source of information on the availability of gasoline, water and ice; some were playing audio of television news broadcasts otherwise unavailable because of power failures. ''The biggest fear is the unknown,'' Mr. Allums said. ''We don't know how long before we can get back into our home and our work.'' Three generations of the Costa family of Metairie formed a four-car caravan here at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, leaving the Hampton Inn, where they had taken refuge from the hurricane to begin the 160-mile journey home. But a half-hour into the predawn drive, the car radio crackled with warning that no one would be allowed into the New Orleans area until Monday. So the Costas resignedly checked back into the hotel -- except for one carload, which drove on toward Disney World in Orlando, Fla., in hopes of turning nightmare into adventure. By lunchtime, the Hampton Inn still lacked electricity, so employees prepared a barbecue in the parking lot as the Costas and other guests plotted their next steps. ''We're thinking of moving north; we'll become gypsies or something like that,'' said one, Heidi Purnell, 50, who went to Wal-Mart for groceries only to find it was out of water. ''We've left one disaster for another.'' At the Best Western Richmond Suites Hotel in Baton Rouge, 80 miles from New Orleans, some 600 people -- plus their pets -- were crammed into the 145 guest rooms, many of them helping the short-staffed management move patio chairs from the pool area and serve free meals of cold cuts or spaghetti with breakfast sausage. Garrett Kruithof, the general manager, said one woman offered to give up one of the two rooms her family of four was occupying to make room for another refugee. At the Red Roof Inn in Memphis, a six-hour drive from New Orleans, all 130 rooms were booked, many of them double-booked for the coming weekend, when the television show ''American Idol'' is taping in town. ''We don't want to tell anyone they have to check out, because where would they go?'' Michelle Williams, the general manager, said. ''There is nowhere else to go.'' Several families cut back from three rooms to two as they ran out of cash, Ms. Williams said. At the Hilton Lafayette and Towers, 135 miles northwest of New Orleans, Susan Zimmerman's family fills 23 rooms and has commandeered a conference room, renamed Cousins Headquarters, where they play Texas hold 'em and the Family Feud board game and gather each afternoon at 5 p.m. around the votive candles they bought at a nearby Wal-Mart to recite the rosary. Ms. Zimmerman secured the rooms Thursday night in a four-hour online search, and said she has ''104.75 people, 3 cats, 13 dogs and 6 birds'' staying at the hotel, noting that one cousin is nine months pregnant. Teenage nephews and nieces were ''runners'' to make sure each room got word when there was news. ''Today's been a bad day --the more news you get, the worse it gets,'' Ms. Zimmerman sighed, estimating that half her relatives' homes are submerged. ''My father, his name is Pops, and he's 81, and he broke down today,'' she said. ''He cried. He said, 'I never thought that I would ever see this disaster occur that I've heard about my whole life.''' Here at the Hampton Inn, Cookie Costas had the essentials -- medicine for her husband's rheumatoid arthritis, birth certificates and passports, pictures from her granddaughter's graduation. ''But I didn't pack for a week,'' she said. ''We're not prepared for a week.'' Similarly, Danny Mirovich brought ''four pairs of underwear, four shirts'' expecting to be away four days, maximum. But after three nights -- the last without electricity -- at the Hampton Inn in Tuscaloosa, Ala., 300 miles from his home in Red Ridge, La., a New Orleans suburb, Mr. Mirovich loaded his wife, three daughters and their Irish setter puppy, Rescue, back into the van on Tuesday, bound for Lynchburg, Va., 600 miles northeast. ''At $100 a night, how long can you stay here?'' Mr. Mirovich asked. ''I'm going to go to Virginia and see my folks and just make a vacation out of it,'' he said. ''I'm going to go sit at my mama's house. If my house is ruined, there's nothing I can do about it.'' Ms. Allums said she and her husband were thinking of driving north to find a place cheaper than the $89 a night they pay here. Still, she said, they are eager to return home to rebuild their lives. ''When someone says the roots are gone, what happens to the rest of the plant?'' Ms. Allums said. ''It dies. New Orleans is our roots.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE DISPLACED"
"With holes in its roof and thousands of people stranded inside, the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans has become a large, leaky refugee center. But whether it will be ready to return to use as a football stadium anytime soon is a question. The Superdome is the home field for the New Orleans Saints, who have been in San Jose, Calif., since Sunday preparing to play a preseason game against the Oakland Raiders on Thursday night. The Saints open the regular season on Sept. 11 away but are scheduled to be at home against the New York Giants on Sept. 18. They have another home game Oct. 2 against Buffalo. But those games might have to be moved, because early reports indicate power might not be restored to New Orleans for four to six weeks. HURRICANE KATRINA"
"As Hurricane Katrina plowed through the Mississippi River basin, shutting down ports, flooding cities and cutting power lines, economists warned that it was likely to leave a deeper mark on the national economy than previous hurricanes because of its profound disruption to the Gulf of Mexico's complex energy supply network. ''The typical pattern with a natural disaster like this is that the regional economy gets clobbered but you can barely see it in the national statistics,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''This time it is very different because of the impact on the energy infrastructure.'' Already, it is clear that much of the economic activity in the gulf region has indeed been clobbered. New Orleans, home to nearly a million people, is under water. By yesterday morning an estimated 2.7 million residents in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi had reported power failures, with many expected to be without electricity for weeks. Conventional and mobile telephone service along the Gulf Coast suffered from severe disruptions from flooded call-routing equipment and damaged cellular towers. Businesses across the Southern interior ground to a halt as then storm affected the region's transportation network and power grid. Since last Thursday, AirTran, a low-fare airline, has canceled 195 flights because of Katrina, including 18 cancellations yesterday. Casinos were destroyed in Mississippi and New Orleans; tourism is not expected to revive for months. Grain shipments face serious delay: Bunge, the world's largest oil-seed processor, evacuated a huge soybean operation in Destrehan, La., its main export terminal in the United States. Food exports and imports that normally flow in huge quantities through regional ports, roads and rail lines are likely to face major disruptions for weeks, if not longer. Economic activity is expected to resume in the next few days and weeks in all but the worst-hit locations. But what worries most economists is Katrina's ripple effect on energy prices. A spike in the price of gasoline just ahead of Labor Day will force consumers to dig deeper into their wallets on one of the busiest driving weekends of the year, providing both a real and psychological blow to spending on other goods and services. And a sustained rise in the cost of energy could substantially slow economic growth. Across the storm's path, it has been difficult to come to grips with the extent of devastation. Ed Preau, assistant secretary for intermodal transport at Louisiana's transportation and development department in Baton Rouge, said he assumed that ports east of New Orleans remain closed because they are under water. But he said he could not be sure because ''I have no contact with anybody in the 504 area code.'' Yesterday, the Coast Guard barred all traffic except barges and tugs from the Mississippi delta to the Arkansas state line, a spokesman said. While all estimates at this stage are just guesses, privately insured losses could reach $15 billion or more, according to Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute in New York, making Katrina the most expensive hurricane for the insurance industry since Andrew hit Florida in 1992. Other analysts estimated insured losses up to $25 billion. Damage from flooding, which private insurers do not cover, could easily double the figure. But economists point out that although Katrina has destroyed a lot of accumulated wealth, it ultimately will probably have a positive effect on measured growth over the next few months as vast resources from around the country are channeled to rebuilding. Even as shuttered businesses will temporarily add to joblessness, the huge reconstruction effort is expected to create jobs in construction and a host of related sectors. Insurance companies and the federal government will pick up a significant portion of the cost. ''Longer term, in the wake of a number of hurricanes there is actually an increase in measured output that even shows up at the national level, because there is a whole bunch of rebuilding activity,'' said Stephen P.A. Brown, director of energy economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ''Though in some sense it would be easy to argue that we have been made worse by the hurricane, the process of rebuilding of property contributes to an increase in output.'' But it will take a while to get to that stage. With buildings damaged, roads closed, power lines down and telephone service severely crimped, restoring basic services is the first order of business. Even cellphone service in the New Orleans 504 area code, for example, may not come back easily. Still, at the national level, the already stressed energy supply system is considered the most critical sector to watch. ''The economic impact of delays in getting exports of grain out is not as large as the impact of delays in getting oil in,'' said John Robertson, an economist at the Atlanta Fed. According to Mr. Behravesh at Global Insight, in a best case outlook, with oil and natural gas supplies falling by 2 percent or less, oil prices are likely to stay at $65 to $70 a barrel for the next couple of weeks while gasoline prices climb to $3 a gallon for a couple of months. He estimated that course of events would shave no more than half a percentage point from output growth in the fourth quarter. But Mr. Behravesh noted that if the disruption of supplies is deeper, oil prices could spike to $100 a barrel and gas at the pump could soar to $3.50 a gallon for four months to six months. That kind of price shock could sharply curtail consumer spending elsewhere, possibly bringing economic growth for the October-December quarter to a halt from the 3 percent gains most analysts have been expecting. As news trickles in of the storm's damage, economic prospects are looking bleaker. The storm crippled oil and gas operations in the gulf and shut down most of the output from the region, which accounts for nearly a third of domestic oil production and a fifth of natural gas output. It also forced the closing of nearly 10 percent of the nation's refining capacity, concentrated in Mississippi and Louisiana. The hurricane also shut a major oil-import terminal in Louisiana with a daily capacity of one million barrels, about a 10th of the nation's overall imports. Pipelines to markets in the Northeast and the Midwest also closed. Power will have to be restored to them before they can resume supplying markets outside the area. Analysts said it would probably take weeks before the full extent of the damage is revealed and months before production is restored to its pre-storm levels. The supply squeeze is already rippling through the economy. The Air Transport Association estimated that jet fuel production was cut by 13 percent. ''We're working extremely hard to avoid any operational impact,'' said John Heimlich, chief economist for the association. Mr. Heimlich said fuel was being transported by tanker plane to airports in the South, including Charlotte, N.C., and West Palm Beach and Fort Myers in Florida. The string of hurricanes that tore through Florida last year provide a useful precedent for understanding Katrina's potential economic impact. Last year hiring in Florida froze in August and September as the hurricanes hit, holding average job gains to just 2,000 a month. By October, however, job growth bounced back to almost 33,000. Ultimately, the four hurricanes in 2004 made only a small dent in the nation's growth. Most of the impact came from Hurricane Ivan, which ripped through underwater oil pipelines, cutting output from refineries and helping push gasoline prices back above $2 a gallon. Those prices already seem like a long-lost dream. HURRICANE KATRINA: ECONOMIC IMPACT"
"After Hurricane Andrew huffed and puffed and then somehow veered away in 1992, the way the storms always seemed to do, the manager of a praline shop in the French Quarter mused on the mixture of fatalism and bravado that has always been at the heart of New Orleans. ''You do live with the belief that some day the big one's going to get you,'' said Patricia McDonald Gomez, general manager of Aunt Sally's Original Creole Pralines said as the party resumed, as it always did on Bourbon Street. ''You're almost fatalistic, which is part of the reason New Orleans has that mixture of frivolity and fatalism. Living in a soup bowl will do it to you, like Romans dancing while Nero fiddled and the city burned.'' Now it seems, after countless close calls, the big one has hit, leaving New Orleanians terrified, stunned, gasping, speechless. With whitecaps on Canal Street, water coursing through breeched levees and 80 percent of the city under water, surviving, not rebuilding, is now the order of the day. But in the back of their minds people who love New Orleans are wondering what will remain physically and psychologically of perhaps America's most distinctive city when the water recedes and -- days, weeks or months from now -- some semblance of everyday life struggles to resume. So former Mayor Marc Morial, now the head of the Urban League and living in New York, kept interrupting a telephone conversation to gasp in disbelief at the watery images on his television and then did his best to conjure up the task ahead. ''We'll rebuild, of course,'' Mr. Morial said. ''But what made New Orleans is the polyglot, the tapestry, the mosaic, the gumbo. So the French Quarter gets most of the attention, but the Quarter feeds from the arteries of the neighborhoods.'' He paused and gasped again as the screen showed the flooded images from the low-income Ninth Ward: ''Oh my God, oh my God. We're looking at the worst natural disaster in American history.'' Left unspoken was the question not of how to rebuild the French Quarter, but how to rebuild the city of Stella, Blanche and Stanley, the city that to William Faulkner was ''the labyrinthine mass of oleander and jasmine, lantana and mimosa,'' a place one admirer said ''could wreck your liver and poison your blood,'' the city of the Italianate mansions of the Garden District and forlorn housing projects like the one named Desire -- a place that gave America most of its music, much of its literature, a cracked mirror glimpse of American exotica and a fair piece of its soul. ''Great Babylon is come up before me,'' shuddered Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel, upon encountering New Orleans more than a century and a half ago. ''Oh, the wickedness, the idolatry of this place.'' In truth, the wickedness has long since become fairly tame, pre-fab voodoo, L.S.U. and Ole Miss sorority girls flashing their breasts from French Quarter balconies and sad-eyed strippers being ogled by drunk conventioneers at seedy Bourbon Street bars. And people have been predicting the slow de-Babylonization of New Orleans for decades, pondering its inexorable transformation into a place like anyplace else. But it never really happened. Mr. Morial said that was partly a function of its identity as a city of natives, who make up 70 percent to 80 percent of the population. It is partly a function of its in-bred business climate, suspicious of newcomers, in which the go-go gene that defined cities like Dallas or Atlanta, petty trifles when New Orleans was at its peak, never took hold. And partly it is a function of geography, the proudly insular culture that results from what one scholar, Pierce Lewis, described as being an ''inevitable city on an impossible site.'' So, as much as the oysters at Felix's or the street performers in Jackson Square, what has defined New Orleans has been nature -- the smothering blanket of humid air, the rains so thunderous, the humorist Roy Blount Jr. once wrote, ''that you expect to see alligators bouncing off the pavement.'' And most of all, the oceanic expanse of water surrounding the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, which covers 600 square miles. That location made it a natural settlement point, a place that drew settlers from every culture that passed by and left it in a place so precarious that this week's disaster has always seemed almost inevitable. Mr. Morial said city planners had been as attentive to hurricane planning as possible and cited the city's shift in focus from shelters to evacuation planning as something that could play an incalculable role in minimizing the casualties from the storm. As for any psychological denial, he noted that other places face earthquakes or floods, and people in New Orleans have always looked at the odds and figured living at nature's mercy in such an alluring hothouse was worth the risk. ''People have always thought, there's a chance for the big one, but is it one in 100? One in 1,000? One in 10,000? One in 100,000?'' he said. ''People have sort of learned to deal with this and live with it, and now we're all having to deal with it.'' Even those who survived the storm with minimal damage were wondering what would happen next in a city whose other dominant thread is entrenched urban poverty. Henry Armand Austan, a 61-year-old photographer, said he picked out his home in the city's Carrollton section uptown because it stood on some of the highest ground around. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Austan had no electricity, but he did have gas and water. He had a clutter of downed banana trees in his backyard, a posse of hungry cats looking for food, a view of looters foraging through shops nearby, and a fiancée whose cellphone had died stranded at the Louisiana Superdome. The foot of water that was in front of his house a day earlier had drained down to the flooded sections below. ''We had a good tourist thing going, but if this place is closed down for six months you can forget that,'' he said by telephone. ''If they don't come back, you wonder what will happen. This is a poor city with a bad education system. Corporate America isn't going to want to put its business in a place that might flood every so often. We might not have a lot to recommend us.'' Some fear that the city that emerges from the floodwaters will finally be turned into a theme park -- the glitter of Bourbon Street without the grit that now surrounds it. But there is also a sense that, like the river, there remains something immutable in New Orleans. As the jazz patriarch Ellis Marsalis once said: ''You know, I don't think New Orleans is ever going to change, because I don't think in the scheme of things, it's supposed to change.'' That sentiment will be tested now as never before, but Mr. Morial said he was confident the city could rebuild and recover. ''I've heard from so many people and everyone says the same thing,'' he said. ''First they say, 'How's your mom? Is she O.K.?' Then they say, 'We've got to do something to help.' A lot of people have lost everything they own, but there's a great spirit, a zeal, to clean up and to rebuild.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: A CHARMED CITY"
"The storm was nothing if not equal opportunity in its misery. In Waveland and Bay St. Louis, modest bungalows and working-class apartment buildings were thrashed, torn open like cellophane bags and filled to their first-floor ceilings with muddy Gulf of Mexico water by Hurricane Katrina's howling winds and powerful tidal surge. But a few miles away, affluent Diamondhead fared no better, and perhaps worse, as the hurricane obliterated an entire subdivision of $500,000 houses, leaving just the pilings they once stood on and piles upon piles of rubbish, sodden clothing and battered appliances. Mary Rae Schmidt, 64, lost two houses. One was a new house in that Diamondhead subdivision. The second was her old house across the Jordan River, which she was to have sold two days before the hurricane arrived. ''I guess the sale is off,'' Ms. Schmidt muttered. Under her feet was an old Johnny Mathis ''Greatest Hits'' vinyl record, one of the few identifiable objects left from her house. She also lost two cats in the storm, which she rode out in a friend's house in Picayune, La.. Now Ms. Schmidt and her husband plan to move to Atlanta to stay with their daughter. ''All I've got are these shoes,'' she said, looking down at her white, mud-splattered sneakers. A neighbor, Lynn Terry, picked through pieces of shattered dinnerware in what used to be her yard. ''It's amazing the things that survive,'' she said, examining a small Pyrex dish. ''Stupid things, like this. But the pictures, the art, the collectibles. All gone.'' She paused and added, ''But we're still here.'' Ms. Terry, an accountant, said she and her husband owned another house in Houston. The damage to their subdivision was so extensive that it looked like the work of a tornado, though it was more likely a result of the storm's 150-mile-an-hour winds. A stand of pine trees snapped in half like matchsticks. Plastic bags, clothing and chunks of cottony insulation clung to branches of the trees as if a clothing store had exploded. Acre upon acre was covered with furniture, bikes, porcelain sinks, air-conditioning ductwork, wicker fans and cooking pots. At a gasoline station off Interstate 10 near Diamondhead, Kristy Verdin, her mother and her brother's family set up camp while they awaited help from government agencies. Their homes in Waveland and Bay St. Louis had been damaged beyond repair. The 10 people planned to stay in an eight-person tent, sustained by luncheon meat and canned food until they found more permanent shelter. Ms. Verdin and her family fled the area on Sunday, taking refuge with friends in Panama City, Fla. But they returned on Monday night, hoping to beat the traffic. They had not heard anything about Waveland on the news, and they said they thought that meant it had been spared. They were wrong. ''We were able to get back to our house,'' Ms. Verdin said. ''But there was nothing there.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: ON THE COAST"
"As Hurricane Katrina blew a destructive path through Biloxi, Miss., on Monday, the Grand Casino Biloxi, owned by Harrah's Entertainment, came unmoored and washed across U.S. 90. The giant casino, with its 134,200 square feet of gambling space, is probably a total loss, the company said. ''It will have to be cut into pieces and moved out of there,'' Gary W. Loveman, Harrah's chief executive, told CNBC. Harrah's Grand Casino Gulfport also suffered severe damage, the company said. The Casino Magic Biloxi, owned by Pinnacle Entertainment, sustained major damage as well, Pinnacle said. State rules in Mississippi require that casinos be built to float on water, rather than be placed on land, and in light of the heavy damage, that may be a requirement that the state and its casino owners now regret. For years, gambling companies have chafed under state laws in Mississippi and elsewhere that require casinos to float. The storm not only forced many Gulf Coast casinos to shut down indefinitely, but also put thousands of people out of work. The gambling industry employs more than 30,000 workers in Mississippi alone, and many could be idled for weeks or even months. In a statement, Mr. Loveman pledged as much as 90 days' pay for workers. The casino closings could hurt Mississippi's ability to recover quickly. The state finances roughly 10 percent of its budget with tax revenues from gambling, and an interruption in those funds could hurt it as it shifts spending to help businesses and residents rebuild. The casinos had buoyed a formerly dismal tourism economy along the Gulf of Mexico, helping to bring the area up to the national average of about 1 percent of workers in tourism-related jobs, according to Steve Cochrane, a managing director at Economy.com. New Orleans, among nine cities Mr. Cochrane identified as vulnerable to the hurricane, has the strongest tourism base, with about 2 percent of workers employed in that category. Despite all the damage, some casino owners yesterday said they were already thinking about rebuilding bigger and better gambling sites. And now the companies will be pressing the state to allow them to build on land, citing safety concerns. ''I'm sure that we will,'' said Allan B. Solomon, executive vice president for Isle of Capri Casinos. The company, based in Biloxi, owns a casino and large hotel there. Mr. Solomon, speaking from an office in Boca Raton, Fla., said he could not determine the property's condition as of yesterday afternoon. Noting that Katrina was but the biggest of a series of hurricanes to batter the Southeast, Marc J. Falcone, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said in a report, ''we believe the Mississippi legislature will be more likely than ever to consider what we believe is critical legislation -- legalization of land-based casinos.'' Mr. Falcone sees that, and possibly approval to build bigger and more luxurious casinos, as a silver lining for the industry. He and other analysts said the gambling companies are well-insured both for structural and equipment damage, as well as for business interruption. Gamblers, meanwhile, tend to come back quickly. ''Vegas was back to close to normal in about 18 months after 9/11,'' said Dennis Forst, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets in Los Angeles. ''Customers forget about it.'' Before many casino employees are back at work, Mr. Cochrane, the economist, said the region's economy will be feeling flush as insurance checks are cashed and a rebuilding boom occurs. ''There is sort of this perverse positive aspect to natural disasters,'' he said. By mid-September, he estimated, based on past disasters, construction work should be in full swing with workers drawn to the Gulf Coast from other regions. In the meantime, though, many businesses and their workers will be hurt. Good Time Tours, which operates 15 luxury buses between Pensacola, Fla., and Biloxi for day-trip gamblers, has nowhere to go for now, said Glen Hill, sales and marketing director. ''Predominantly we're a company that runs people back and forth to Biloxi,'' he said. The company, based in Pensacola, had been planning a mid-September tour -- the ''I survived Hurricane Ivan'' special. Trinity Tour and Travel, another among the 30 or so tour bus companies that carry gamblers to Biloxi, is likewise idle for now, said Ora Faulconer, sales manager. Watching television, she speculated, ''It's probably six months before they open over there.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE GAMBLING INDUSTRY"
"As the extent of the damage to offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico slowly became apparent a day after Hurricane Katrina's passage, oil prices soared above $70 a barrel and gasoline futures jumped by 20 percent yesterday on concerns it would take months to restore production to prestorm levels. For consumers across the nation this means that retail gasoline prices are likely to jump above $3 a gallon -- matching inflation-adjusted records reached in the early 1980's -- just as millions of drivers hit the roads on the Labor Day weekend. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures settled at $69.81 a barrel yesterday, a 3.9 percent jump, after touching a high of $70.85 a barrel earlier in the day, a reflection of how little slack there is on global energy markets to make up for shortages in the gulf. The hurricane, one of the most severe storms to hit the United States, crippled the nation's foremost oil-producing region at the worst possible time for American and global energy markets. It will probably take days, or even weeks, before the full extent of the damage is fully revealed. Repairs are likely to drag on for months. ''The market can't afford any disruption whatsoever,'' said Ben Dell, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York. ''As it happens, we just had the worst disruption ever.'' Most of the oil and gas production from the Gulf of Mexico remained shut off yesterday. The region, which usually produces 1.5 million barrels of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of gas each day, accounts for nearly a third of domestic oil production and a fifth of its natural gas output. Because of flooding and power disruptions, many refiners along the gulf coast in Louisiana and Mississippi remained shut for a second day. The prospect of lengthy delays in restarting refineries sent gasoline futures up 41.39 cents, their highest-ever jump, to $2.47 a gallon on the Nymex. Information trickled in slowly because the offshore industry's base is concentrated near New Orleans. The Coast Guard said that its crews had spotted several sunken platforms and rigs. The destruction was often accompanied by oil spills. ''We're still in the preliminary stages of identifying what damage had been done,'' Petty Officer Larry Chambers, a Coast Guard spokesman, said. ''It could take a couple of days. Some of them are definitely sunk and some of them are definitely out of place.'' The Coast Guard was starting to dispatch hazardous-materials teams to deal with oil and chemical spills yesterday afternoon, although most of its activities remain focused on rescuing people, he said. Offshore platforms were damaged by the storm's winds and waves, and some had snapped out of their moorings and were drifting away; 10 refineries, accounting for 10 percent of the nation's capacity, were shut down and remained without power yesterday; strategic pipelines linking the gulf to major markets in the rest of the country were still closed because they too lacked power. Because of the experience from Hurricane Ivan, which slammed into the gulf last September, much of the concern centered on the underwater pipelines that link the 4,000 platforms in the gulf to the mainland. These were buried, uprooted or damaged by last year's storm, and many feared that they might have suffered a similar fate from underwater mud slides or swells on Monday. The damage from Ivan took months to repair. Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall early Monday, left a grim picture in the south, killing at least 70 people, submerging most of New Orleans and devastating communities in Louisiana and Mississippi. Its impact also highlighted how reliant America's domestic production has become on this region. The United States imports more than 10 million barrels a day of crude oil and more than 1 million barrels a day of gasoline -- 60 percent through ports along the gulf. Nearly half the nation's refining capacity is along the coast, from Texas to Alabama. ''We are very dependent on energy resources produced in the Gulf of Mexico, not just the Persian Gulf,'' said Stephen P. Brown, director of energy economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Royal Dutch Shell, the largest operator in the gulf, said that its Mars platform, a 225,000-barrel-a-day facility that accounts for 15 percent of oil production in the gulf, had sustained some damage to its upper levels. The company also said that two drilling rigs were adrift. Chevron said that it had dispatched helicopters from Texas to fly over its platforms in the gulf and take pictures of the facilities. It planned similar flyovers of its shut-down refinery in Pascagoula, Miss. Exxon Mobil indicated that it had received reports of damage to a gas-processing plant in Grand Isle, La. The storm also crimped power utilities, leaving 18 percent of residents in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi and some small regions of Florida without power, according to the Department of Energy. The loss of power has disabled infrastructure and stalled efforts to restart other energy-related operations like refineries and the main pipeline transportation systems. For example, Colonial Pipeline, which carries refined products like gasoline from Houston to New Jersey and the New England markets, warned that its operations were shut down because of ''widespread damage to the electric grid.'' Other pipelines, like the Plantation Pipeline and the Capline Pipeline, were also completely or partly shut. Over 95 percent of the gulf's daily output -- or 1.43 million barrels -- remained closed yesterday, while gas production was down by 88 percent, or 8.8 billion cubic feet, according to the Minerals Management Service, a unit of the Department of Interior. Since Friday, a total of 4.6 million barrels, nearly 1 percent of the gulf's yearly output, has been lost. Nearly 80 percent of the gulf's manned platforms and three-quarters of the drilling rigs have been evacuated. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port remained shut for a second day. It is one of the main crude oil-importing ports in the gulf, with a daily capacity of a million barrels. The storm has sent the refining industry into a tailspin. Gasoline prices had already been rising in recent weeks, during peak summer demand, because of a series of accidents and shutdowns at refineries. One refiner, Valero, said it might take as much as two weeks to restart its St. Charles refinery in Louisiana. ''The U.S. refinery system has been showing some signs of severe tightness over the past months,'' Kevin Norrish, an analyst with Barclays Capital in London, said in a note. ''The shut-in of refining capacity from Katrina is then not so much a straw, but rather a large log on top of an already fully laden camel.'' Energy prices across the board jumped on the Nymex yesterday. Natural gas prices gained 7.5 percent, to $11.659 a thousand cubic feet; heating oil futures rose 8.8 percent, to $2.0759 a gallon. The risk that high energy prices could have on the global economy -- and the political risk of seeing retail gasoline prices above $3 a gallon -- prompted the Bush administration on Monday to say that it would lend some crude oil from the nation's emergency stockpiles to refiners. To reduce the pressure on prices, the International Energy Agency, which coordinates the emergency response of industrialized countries, could direct its member states to release both crude oil and refined gasoline products to the United States. The agency, based in Paris, indicated that it was waiting for a full assessment of the damage before taking any such action. But in the short term, not much can be done to help lower prices. ''We already have built into this market retail prices of more than $3 a gallon, that's a certainty,'' said Ben Brockwell, the director of pricing with Oil Price Information Service, an independent trade publication. ''The question is how quickly we get there and how long they stay there.'' ''The futures market is indicative of the direction of the market but substantially understates what's been happening on the physical markets,'' he said. The storm's effects were made worse because commercial stocks of gasoline, which now stand at 20 days of demand, are at historic lows. On the other hand, with the end of the driving season after Labor Day, demand is expected to drop soon. Still, over the next few days, gasoline prices at service stations will reflect yesterday's price jump on Nymex. While there are not likely to be shortages, drivers will notice substantially higher prices at the pump. ''The United States doesn't have to worry about gasoline lines but consumers need to worry about the price they pay this week,'' said Deborah White, an analyst at Société Générale in Paris. ''They should be prepared for a short-term shock. Only time can fix that.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE OIL SUPPLY"
"Two decades have passed since the last significant hurricane hit New York -- Gloria, in September 1985 -- but local officials have been preparing for another one for years. A Category 3 hurricane could bring a 25-foot storm surge crashing over the financial district, Kennedy International Airport, southern Brooklyn and eastern Staten Island; inundate dozens of other low-lying areas; and force the evacuation of 400,000 to 2.4 million residents. City officials are closely monitoring Hurricane Katrina, one of the most devastating storms ever to strike the United States, because it involved the evacuation of another major city, New Orleans. Yesterday, the city sent 35 search-and-rescue workers to Mississippi; a team of emergency planners will follow in a few days to collect insights on how the New York region would respond to a hurricane in the Northeast. Just three weeks ago, on Aug. 10, New York City officials and the National Weather Service, along with emergency management officials from Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, held a symposium to mark the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Gloria and to discuss storm history and preparedness. ''The good thing about hurricanes is you have some time, if you pull the trigger early and get people moving early,'' the city's commissioner of emergency management, Joseph F. Bruno, said yesterday. ''I think we're in very good shape. We're working very hard to upgrade our plan and learn from other parts of the country, including Mississippi and Louisiana.'' Mr. Bruno said a challenge was to ''raise the consciousness'' of city residents about the dangers of hurricanes. ''They may be saying to themselves, 'It's not going to happen here,''' he said. ''We are doing our best to say, 'It can happen here and it has happened here.''' Michael E. Wyllie, the meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service's local forecast office, in Upton, on eastern Long Island, said the region was due for a strong hurricane within the next decade, based on a 20- to 30-year hurricane cycle. ''We're only 10 years into an active, multidecade cycle that will probably last at least another 10 years,'' he said. ''Most likely we're going to get hit with something in the next several years, if not this year. Our time is coming. I'm not trying to be an alarmist; I'm trying to be a realist.'' The Office of Emergency Management has developed an extensive plan to protect people along a 578-mile waterfront. The plan includes a network of coastal evacuation routes and 23 ''reception centers'' across the five boroughs. The centers would send evacuated residents to about 100 shelters stocked with food and basic supplies. The agency has identified three hurricane evacuation zones. Most at risk is Zone A, which includes Battery Park City; Coney Island; Breezy Point, Queens; and the western and eastern coasts of Staten Island -- all low-lying coastal and other areas that would be flooded if any hurricane made landfall close by. Zone B, which includes much of southeastern Brooklyn and southern Queens, parts of East Harlem and the area around Newtown Creek, and La Guardia and Kennedy Airports, indicates areas at risk from a moderate hurricane. Zone C, which includes areas farther inland, includes areas that could be hit in a major hurricane -- an unlikely, but not impossible, situation. The goal would be to evacuate people before any subway service is shut down. And the shortage of parking spaces means that New Yorkers would be urged to use buses to reach the reception centers. ''We just don't have the capacity and locations to store all these vehicles if everyone were to come by private car,'' said Michael W. Lee, the agency's director of watch command, who helps coordinate responses to emergencies. A dozen people interviewed yesterday in Sea Gate, Brooklyn, had only a vague idea of what to do in a hurricane. ''We have never talked about evacuation,'' Marina Berkovich, 37, said of her family. ''We don't even know where to go.'' At the Sea Gate Beach Club, Ben Cohen, 84, a retiree, said his apartment in Brighton Beach was on the 18th floor. ''I don't expect it to rise that high,'' he said. New York City's coastal population, unlike those in many other cities, is largely made up of immigrants or lower-income residents, said MaryAnn E. Marrocolo, a director at the emergency management department, ''They may not have the means to evacuate, or access to information about the evacuation,'' she said. She urged residents to call the city's 311 hot line or consult a city Web site, nyc.gov/emols, to find out whether they live in an evacuation zone. Another site, nyc.gov/readyny, has links to hurricane-related brochures and maps in Chinese, Haitian Creole, Russian and Spanish. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg urged residents seeking to help victims of Hurricane Katrina to donate to the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army or the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, a nonprofit group the city founded in 1994 that distributes donations to relief agencies. The 35 city workers who were sent to Mississippi are expected to spend 7 to 10 days in the South. They are part of a 210-member urban search and rescue team, one of 28 across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency finances the teams and decides when to deploy them. The rescue team will first be sent to Camp Shelby, a National Guard training center in Hattiesburg, north of the Gulf Coast, before being deployed to the disaster area."
"Until engineers can repair breaks in the huge levees that separate New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain, the city will essentially be an arm of the Gulf of Mexico, subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. And because the tidal pull widens the breaks, experts said yesterday, that will make it all the harder to repair them -- the first step in restoring the inundated city to normal. ''We've been living in this bowl,'' said Shea Penland, a coastal geologist who has studied storm threats to Louisiana for years. ''And then Katrina broke channels into the bowl and the bowl filled. And now the bowl is connected to the Gulf of Mexico. We are going to have to close those inlets and then pump it dry.'' John Hall, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, said last night that the corps and other agencies were ''in a great frenzy'' to figure out how to plug the largest breach, a 300-foot gap in the levee along the 17th Street Canal. The narrow canal, which is used to drain water pumped out of the eternally soggy city, is not accessible by barge, in part because a newly built low bridge and hurricane barrier sits 700 feet down the canal toward the lake end. ''We can't get at it,'' Mr. Hall said. Another problem is that whatever is done to block the breach must not also block the canal itself, because that would impede the pumping of the floodwaters. Federal officials are seeking help from agencies and private contractors that might be able to supply heavy cranes and other equipment. The levees, which provide a tenuous barrier between the city and the waters that surround most of it, have long had many weak spots and were not designed to withstand the full force of a storm like Hurricane Katrina. Both major breaches took place along canals built in decades past as conduits for commerce, Army Corps officials said. The other failure occurred along the Industrial Canal, an 80-year-old channel that had been identified as a weak spot in computer simulations of storm surges from hypothetical hurricanes. Mr. Hall said that as the surge from the storm swept in through Lake Pontchartrain -- actually a broad inlet off the gulf -- it began sloshing over the vertical steel and concrete wall and the earthen berm behind it. ''Once it got over, it began to scour down at the base of that flood wall on the protected side,'' he said. The rising waters in the canal pushed in on the high part of the retaining wall while water cascading over the top ate away at the base, Mr. Hall said, adding: ''The effect is like a high-low tackle in football. You hit the head and feet at the same time from opposite directions, and it goes down.'' S. Jeffress Williams, a United States Geological Survey scientist with long experience in Louisiana, said repairing the levees would require ''a large volume of as dense, as heavy material as you can get, applied quickly.'' ''Where you get the material and how you get the equipment up there is going to be a real problem,'' he went on. ''If you don't keep it going, it is just going to erode away. You have to have a persistent and constant feed until it is done.'' Dr. Penland, the director of the Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of New Orleans, said it was impossible to say how long it would take to repair the levees and pump the city dry. At a wild guess, he said, the process could take two months. New Orleans has 22 pumping stations that need to work nearly continuously to discharge normal storm runoff and seepage. But they are notoriously fickle. Efforts to add backup power generators to keep them all running during blackouts have been delayed by a lack of federal money. ''Pumping the water out -- that's a lot of water,'' Dr. Penland said. ''When the pumping systems are in good shape, it can rain an inch an hour for about four to six hours and the pumps can keep pace. More than that, the city floods.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: FLOODWATERS"
"As they rushed medical equipment and experts to the Gulf Coast, federal officials warned yesterday that the public health consequences of Hurricane Katrina were likely to be enormous and long term. The officials said they were particularly worried about outbreaks of disease spread through sewage contamination of drinking water, spoiled food, insects, and bites from snakes and other animals. Scores of people have already died by drowning or other causes, two by carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of gas-powered generators in poorly ventilated areas. An additional nine people are being treated for carbon monoxide poisoning, federal health officials said at a news conference in Atlanta, home of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rescue workers searched for the injured and disabled yesterday in an effort to prevent additional fatalities, and, trying to head off outbreaks of diarrheal disease, used helicopters to deliver food and safe drinking water. ''We're racing the clock'' to find stranded people, digging trapped victims out of collapsed concrete and metal, and providing food and water, Michael Chertoff, secretary of homeland security, said at the Atlanta news conference. In New Orleans, Tulane University Hospital and Clinic, which was surrounded by about four feet of water, lost both of its backup generators to the flooding and began evacuating all its 200 patients, 30 requiring critical care. H.C.A., which manages the hospital, hired 20 helicopters to land in succession on its helipad, atop a parking garage, and ferry the patients to Women's and Children's Hospital in Lafayette, La., and elsewhere. In addition to the patients, more than 800 others were stranded at the Tulane hospital and also required evacuation: members of the staff as well as their families, families of patients and people who had simply sought shelter there. The hospital had only portable generators remaining, which provided just enough power to run a small amount of equipment. Among the tasks was to light the helipad in the darkness last night. Because elevators were inoperable, members of the staff were carrying patients up the stairs. Karen Troyer-Caraway, a vice president of the hospital, said by telephone at 8:20 p.m., New Orleans time, that ''we are in absolute complete darkness,'' with only flashlights to guide those still there. Michael O. Leavitt, secretary of health and human services, said his department was working to open up 1,000 hospital beds on an emergency basis in the Gulf Coast region. The disease control centers has sent basic supplies like first-aid and suture kits, sterile gloves, bandages, blankets and portable oxygen tanks from the national stockpile. In addition, the Public Health Service has deployed 38 doctors and nurses and has an additional 217 on stand-by. Experts warned that a major challenge would be to coordinate efforts by government and private organizations and the many health care workers who might voluntarily go to the region. But all the energy being expended in the initial phase of flood relief is likely to be dwarfed by what lies ahead. ''This is going to be a long-term event,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Sinks Jr., an epidemiologist at the C.D.C. The affected area is ''a couple of hundred miles wide, four to five times the geographic extent of Hurricane Andrew in 1992,'' Dr. Sinks said. Wherever rescue efforts take place, there will be concerns about injuries from falls, broken glass, downed wires and other hazards, said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. Other worries will focus on bites from poisonous snakes like the cottonmouth, an excellent swimmer. Alligators could also be a menace, as could raccoons, which are capable of spreading rabies and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can lead to meningitis, kidney damage and liver failure. Health workers will also have to deal with the long-term mental health problems that develop among the hurricane's survivors. Dr. Irwin Redlener, who directs the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Columbia School of Public Health, said yet another concern was that people might have lost or become separated from the drugs they rely on daily for diabetes, heart disease and other chronic ailments. Pharmacies in the affected areas may have insufficient stocks of vital drugs like insulin for diabetics, a circumstance creating a need to import and distribute essential medicines in the area. The shortage could go on for months, Dr. Redlener said. The poorest areas are expected to be hit hardest. Experience has shown, Dr. Redlener said, that ''the more underserved and more economically fragile a community is pre-disaster, the more we expect to see severe consequences after a disaster.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: HEALTH CONCERNS"
"Shortly after 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Sherry Landry, the city attorney, said she and the mayor's staff were on their way to set up a base of operations for New Orleans -- in Baton Rouge. For his own safety, Ms. Landry urged a reporter to leave New Orleans immediately. ''Get out,'' she said. ''I mean it.'' A day after the city thought that it had been largely spared from Hurricane Katrina, everyone but the most essential emergency workers was urged to leave as Lake Pontchartrain flowed through a hole in a retaining wall and across much of New Orleans. No one knew for sure when they might be able to return. Anxiety was rising with the flood. Clean water was scarce, the only electricity was coming from private generators and almost every store was closed. Some were being looted, with the police too overwhelmed to stop them. One officer was shot and critically injured. ''We have a major looting problem,'' said Col. Terry Ebbert, the chief of homeland security for the city. ''These are not individuals looting; these are large groups of armed individuals.'' People who could not flee the city went instead right to its center, hoping to find shelter and food. Many wound up at the Superdome, the multipurpose arena that is being tested like never before. Marshall Daranda sloshed his way there on Tuesday morning in water that was ankle deep and rising, wearing a bright orange life preserver and holding his only change of clothes in a plastic shopping bag. He went to bed on Monday thinking he had weathered the hurricane just fine. He woke up Tuesday to water building up in the kitchen of his home in the Bayou St. John neighborhood. ''I knew I had to get out of there,'' said Mr. Daranda, 57, who lives alone. ''Walking over here, some water was up to my neck.'' By 11 a.m., the water was nearly three feet deep outside the Superdome, where more than 12,000 refugees are being sheltered: people who went there for safety before the storm, people who sought protection after it, patients whose hospitals could no longer function and hundreds who were rescued from roofs and attics. Calvin Damond, 55, pushed a shopping cart through the rising waters on Poydras Street, loaded with two suitcases, cartons of Pampers and his 5-year-old grandson. As their home in the Upper Ninth Ward filled with water during the storm, Mr. Damond, his daughter, Katherine, and her three children climbed into the attic. ''We stayed there all night,'' Mr. Damond said. The water receded Tuesday morning, he said, and he carried the children out on his shoulders and toward the Superdome. Bethaney Waithe, 57, made her way there, balancing a plaid plastic tote bag with a few survival items on her head. Ms. Waithe said she tried to persuade her roommate, Rohanda Randall, to leave their house on Tuesday as the water slowly crept up the sides. But Ms. Randall has trouble walking and refused to go. ''She said God would protect her,'' Ms. Waithe recalled. ''I said, 'Come on, girl, put on your shoes and let's go.' She said, 'God will take care of me.''' Yvonne Gaines, 64, who suffered a stroke last year, stayed with friends in a housing project after her own home flooded. Then the water threatened the housing project. Now she, too, was bound for the Superdome, shuffling there with an aluminum walker. The authorities had said from the start that the Superdome would not be a full-service shelter and urged people to use it only as a last resort if they could not evacuate the city. The Superdome itself may be evacuated on Wednesday as stifling heat, overflowing toilets and a lack of clean water was making it uninhabitable. ''The situation is not good,'' said Errol Brown, who is 57 and a merchant mariner, as he stood outside the arena. ''The food is not excellent. Sometimes they run out of food. And you cannot leave because of the flooding. I got no place to go, anyway.'' Mr. Brown had brought along a life preserver just in case. Maria Patricia Cruz, a housekeeper at a hotel in New Orleans, was feeding her 18-month-old son the last of her baby formula. She had been given two cartons by national guardsmen, she said. Now there was no more. ''I don't know what we are going to do,'' she said in Spanish. Delmer W. Bodden, another merchant mariner, said that the heat inside the dome was unbearable and that the cars being driven inside the dome by those helping the refugees were spewing exhaust. ''It's choking,'' Mr. Bodden said. ''We came outside to get some fresh air. It's nasty inside there. It's muggy. Humid. People need showers. The toilets are filthy. You can't go to the restrooms.'' Patricia Degruy, 46, a day care worker, and her husband, Earl Payne, 50, a truck driver, said they were trying to find a shelter worker to volunteer to help clean up the toilets. ''The situation here is terrible,'' Ms. Degruy said. ''There are more people coming instead of us leaving. They're bringing people in from the water. Food must be getting short because they're stamping your hand now when you get a meal. The bathrooms are disgusting, even the handicapped bathrooms.'' She said that there was no TV, no radio and that the shelter workers were hard to find. ''We can't get no information,'' she said, ''nothing. We don't know nothing about what's going on. We know the streets are flooded. We don't know if we still have a house.'' There were other reasons for anxiety. Colonel Ebbert said looters stole a large supply of weapons on Tuesday from a Wal-Mart in the Lower Garden District. He also said all the sheriffs' departments throughout the state were sending in help. ''The New Orleans Police are almost completely involved in saving lives and not in guarding the city,'' he said. Around midday, dozens of people set upon the huge, red brick Super Wal-Mart on Tchoupitoulas Street in the Lower Garden District, hauling out armloads of food, clothing, kitchen appliances and television sets. A locked police car with no driver in sight sat in front of the store and two fire engines idled at a side entrance, red and white lights flashing. No one intervened as people filled shopping carts, cars, and pickup trucks with goods. ''Ain't nobody stealing anything,'' said Ida Henry as she and her teenage daughter jammed new Wal-Mart clothing into their already overflowing Dodge van. ''They said, 'Take what you need,' because the levee is a-busting. It's about to flood and everything is going to be ruined anyway.'' Filling up another van, Wilson Smith, 19, said he and his family had abandoned their home at Philip and St. Thomas after a tree tore open a roof during the hurricane. ''We need clothes and food,'' Mr. Smith said. He gestured to the parked squad car. ''The police are letting everybody go in and get what they need.'' ''They're not letting you get TV's and stuff,'' he said. ''But the people are overpowering them.'' On one of the fire trucks, a firefighter said the emptying of the Wal-Mart was not authorized. The store had offered food to the police and firefighters, but when they arrived, the looters ''were breaking down the doors,'' he said. The officer, who declined to give his name because he said department members were not permitted to speak to reporters without permission, said he and other officers were keeping their distance because ''there's not enough police to stop them.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: NEW ORLEANS"
"On the day after Hurricane Katrina was declared to be not as bad as originally feared, it became clear that the effects of the storm had been, after all, beyond devastation. Homeowners in Biloxi, Miss., staggered through wrecked neighborhoods looking for their loved ones. In New Orleans, the mayor reported that rescue boats had begun pushing past dead bodies to look for the stranded living. Gas leaks began erupting into flames, and looking at the city, now at least 80 percent under water, it was hard not to think of last year's tsunami, or even ancient Pompeii. Disaster has, as it almost always does, called up American generosity and instances of heroism. Young people helped the old onto rafts in flooded New Orleans streets, and exhausted rescue workers refused all offers of rest, while people as far away as Kansas and Arizona went online to offer shelter in their homes to the refugees. It was also a reminder of how much we rely on government to imagine the unimaginable and plan for the worst. As the levees of Lake Pontchartrain gave way, flooding New Orleans, it seemed pretty clear that in this case, government did not live up to the job. But this seems like the wrong moment to dwell on fault-finding, or even to point out that it took what may become the worst natural disaster in American history to pry President Bush out of his vacation. All the focus now must be on rescuing the survivors. Beyond that lies a long and painful recovery, which must begin with a national vow to help all the storm victims and to save and repair New Orleans. People who think of that graceful city and the rest of the Mississippi Delta as tourist destinations must have been reminded, watching the rescue operations, that the real residents of this area are in the main poor and black. The only resources most of them will have to fall back on will need to come from the federal government. Those of us in New York watch the dire pictures from Louisiana with keen memories of the time after Sept. 11, when the rest of the nation made it clear that our city was their city, and that everyone was part of the battle to restore it. New Orleans, too, is one of the places that belongs to every American's heart -- even for people who have never been there. Right now it looks as if rescuing New Orleans will be a task much more daunting than any city has faced since the San Francisco fire of 1906. It must be a mission for all of us. Editorial"
"With their offices and presses flooded, news media outlets in New Orleans mostly abandoned newsprint and television broadcasts yesterday and set up shop on the Web. The Times-Picayune, whose daily circulation is 270,000, put out only an electronic edition yesterday with a one-word headline summing up the impact of Hurricane Katrina: ''Catastrophic.'' A morning update on the Web site said The Times-Picayune was evacuating its building in New Orleans and that staff members were heading for Houma, a bayou town about 60 miles to the west. The newspaper's office phones and its e-mail system went dead. Only one of the four local television stations, WWL Channel 4, a CBS affiliate, has been able to stay on the air throughout the last few days. Channel 4, owned by the Belo Corporation, used a tower and transmitter at the company's new facility in Gretna, La., and also sent journalists to the communications center at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, more than 75 miles away. Two other stations, WNOL Channel 38, a WB affiliate, and WGNO Channel 26, an ABC affiliate, went off the air and relied on their Web sites, which featured weather updates, video footage and advice for coping with the disaster. ''What we've done in the interim is use the Web sites of both stations to get news to viewers and employees,'' said Gary Weitman, a spokesman for Tribune Broadcasting, which owns the stations. WDSU Channel 6, an NBC affiliate, moved its operations to two sister stations, one in Jackson, Miss., and another in Orlando, Fla. With some interruptions, it got back on the air and presented news and weather programming on its Web site as well. ''The Web played a big role in all of this,'' said Tom Campo, a spokesman for Hearst-Argyle, the station's owner. The Internet, as a decentralized communications network, can be more resilient than traditional media when natural disasters occur. ''Owning broadcast towers and printing presses were useless,'' said Jeff Jarvis, a consultant to online media companies. ''The Web proved to be a better media in a case like this.'' Yesterday, phone calls to the New Orleans region met with only busy signals, and the occasional communications from New Orleans to other parts of the country tended to be sent from the private e-mail accounts of editors and reporters. In the afternoon, a message from Peter Kovacs, a Times-Picayune managing editor, reached the paper's bureau in Washington, with a brevity of a wartime cable message. ''Still in Houma. Phones don't work well,'' Mr. Kovacs wrote. ''Leaving for Baton Rouge to set up shop. Shea staying behind to set up a copy desk,'' a reference to Dan Shea, the paper's other managing editor. Despite the scramble to find a new base of operations, The Times-Picayune was able to add a few staff-written stories to its Web site during the day as well as updates from The Associated Press. The Times-Picayune is part of the Newhouse chain of newspapers, owned by Advance Publications. The paper's Web site, www.nola.com, is run from computers in a data center in New Jersey, said Mr. Jarvis, the former president of Advance.net, which oversees the Web sites of the Newhouse papers. Steven Newhouse, the chairman of Advance.net, said he had mostly been watching The Times-Picayune's struggle to keep reporting the news from a distance since he lost e-mail and phone contact with the editors. ''So we've been out of touch, but they've had this amazing publishing thing on the Web and the Web log and they've done it under these terrible conditions,'' Mr. Newhouse said. ''It's a credit to everyone's ingenuity and their willingness to figure it out on the fly.'' Web logs, or blogs, have become magnets for advice, opinion and personal observations sent in by individuals to media Web sites and on personal blogs -- as they typically do in response to major news events. On ''Kaye's Hurricane Katrina Blog,'' Kaye Trammell, an assistant professor of mass communication at L.S.U., cautioned readers, for example, that cellphone use was still limited in the New Orleans region. ''So if you're trying to call a loved one that might have been impacted by the storm,'' she wrote, ''please keep in mind that not getting through on a cellphone is not an indication of their safety.'' Others were more personal. John Strain, a social worker in Covington, La., described the hurricane's assault on Monday. ''The wind is really picking up now and I hear the roof above me wobble,'' he wrote in his online journal. ''The sound is like a waterfall or rushing river.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE NEWS MEDIA"
"THE national commission that studied the terror attacks of Sept. 11 concluded that the lapses in preventing or responding to the attacks stemmed from a collective failure to imagine that such a catastrophe could happen. Emergency officials and meteorologists fear a similar failure of imagination on Long Island about major hurricanes. Conditions are right this year for one or more especially severe storms to lash the Island, they say. But it's been a long time -- 67 years -- since the last Big One, and officials worry that Long Islanders accustomed to the glancing blows of minor storms have little grasp of just how devastating a major hurricane could be. ''The only people who really have any idea are those who lived through the 1938 storm,'' said Michael E. Wyllie, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service office in Upton, referring to the unnamed hurricane that laid waste to eastern Long Island that year. ''And you are talking about people who are into their 70's to even remember it.'' The 1938 hurricane killed more than 50 people on Long Island, even though it struck the sparsely populated East End on Sept. 21, long after the crowds of summer visitors were gone. It killed hundreds more in Rhode Island as it roared northward, flooding that state's cities. Over all, the storm took 600 lives and did about $308 million in damage to insured property, the equivalent of $4.1 billion today, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. Scientists and officials using newly refined computer models say that a repeat of that storm today would be many times as destructive, because so much valuable real estate has since been developed on or near the shore, directly in harm's way. Timely evacuation of threatened areas, impossible in 1938 because there was almost no warning of the storm's approach, could prevent most loss of life in a repeat. But officials cite this danger: many people may think they can ride out a major hurricane as easily as they have the tamer storms the Island has seen lately. It's been two decades since the last significant hurricane hit Long Island, and that one was Gloria, a Category 1 storm, the lowest rung on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, with sustained winds of no more than 95 miles an hour. That fast-moving 1985 storm, remembered mostly for tree damage and lengthy power failures, gave little hint of the worst that can be expected from a Category 3 hurricane like the 1938 storm, Mr. Wyllie said. If ever there was a year for big hurricanes to strike Long Island, 2005 would seem to be it. High water temperatures in the Atlantic, weak atmospheric wind-shear conditions and the storm-steering influence of the seasonal weather phenomenon known as the Bermuda High all seem to be providing a window for a fearsome storm to charge up the East Coast. The season peaks in September. If the 1938 hurricane, the strongest to strike Long Island in the last century, were to hit today, emergency officials say that Suffolk County alone would suffer more than $24 billion in losses. Nassau's losses would be smaller because the track of the storm would be well to the east, but it, too, might suffer damage in the hundreds of millions or more. The county has not calculated a dollar estimate. Officials are more circumspect about projecting human casualties. The toll would depend on whether people heeded evacuation orders, they say. Those who did not would be on their own as winds and waters rose and police and emergency crews hunkered down to ride out the hurricane. ''The cavalry will not be coming over the hill,'' said Thomas O'Hara, an ambulance services consultant in Suffolk's Department of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Services. ''So when we tell you to go, it's time to go.'' The most prudent residents, Mr. O'Hara said, will bypass public shelters and clear out of Long Island entirely. ''Get in the car and go visit Aunt Tillie in Highland Falls,'' he said. ''The last place you want to end up is isolated and alone, and the second-last place is in a public shelter, because I assure you, you will not get a mint on your pillow.'' County emergency planners and Federal Emergency Management Agency recommend preparing for a hurricane by taking these basic precautions: gathering a ''go kit'' of essentials, including medications; filling the car's gas tank; keeping bottled water, flashlights with fresh batteries, and a battery-powered radio or television on hand in case the power goes out; and having a family emergency plan. The two counties and the State Emergency Management Office are currently surveying residents in coastal areas to gauge their preparedness and to find out what they would do in the face of an approaching storm. The survey results will help officials fine-tune plans for evacuation and shelters. ''Everybody over the years has gravitated towards the water, and we have gotten complacent and are not thinking about the ramifications of that,'' said Joseph Williams, Suffolk's commissioner of fire, rescue and emergency services. The projections of economic loss, generated by a new computer program called Hazus-MH that was released to state and local governments last year by FEMA, are one indication of the Island's vulnerability. Aided by Hazus-MH and other continually updated programs that leave less and less to the imagination, officials see an ever-clearer picture of what hurricanes could do. And it is not a pretty sight. Gregory J. Caronia, the director for emergency preparedness in Nassau's Office of Emergency Management, recently produced a map that showed how Long Island would fare in a worst-case hurricane -- a Category 4 storm hitting at high tide, with winds as high as 155 m.p.h., moving west-northwest at 30 miles an hour. The Island looked like a swamped boat with water pouring over the gunwales. Based on National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Slosh maps (an acronym for ''sea, lake and overland surges from hurricanes''), the map showed the entire city of Long Beach under more than eight feet of water, enough to obliterate houses and put oceanfront high rises at imminent peril of being undermined and toppled. A tidal surge running up to 21 feet above normal high tide would flood low-lying communities all along the South Shore and as far as five miles inland. Tides could run more than 30 feet above normal in Little Neck Bay and 24 feet above normal around Manhasset Bay and Hempstead Harbor, the map shows, as wind-driven water piles up relentlessly in the narrower westward reaches of the Sound with nowhere to go but ashore. In Suffolk, Fire Island and its summer communities would be overrun by waves. The surging waters would cut off the eastern end of the South Fork at Napeague, making an island out of Montauk, and would swamp much of the North Fork. Ocean surf would cause major erosion. In West Hampton Dunes, an Army Corps of Engineers project to rebuild dunes and close a breach in the barrier island, completed in 1993, would be no match for the raging surf, and the multimillion-dollar homes built there in recent years would almost certainly be washed away. Clifford Jones, the project manager for the corps, said the beach rebuilding was designed to protect against more modest storms, the kind that occur about once in 44 years on average. He said the corps estimated a 50 percent chance that the new beach and dunes would be overcome during the project's 30-year expected life. Along with pounding surf, a Category 4 hurricane would bring with it lightning strikes, torrential rain, major inland flooding, tons of airborne debris and fallen trees -- and, if the winds were high enough, roofs and walls all over the Island would be torn away, not just at the shore. The Long Island Power Authority estimates that in a major storm, as many as one million homes and businesses -- in other words, nearly everyone on the Island -- could lose power, some for long periods. As calamitous as all that would be, it would still pale in comparison to the damage in New York City, where the Rockaway peninsula, parts of Wall Street, many subway stations and all of John F. Kennedy International Airport would be under water. Forecasters say that while it is possible for such a Category 4 hurricane to reach Long Island, it probably will not happen more than once in 500 years. The strongest storm of all, a Category 5, is considered all but impossible this far north, because water temperatures here are never high enough. The computer maps generated by Mr. Caronia, Nassau's emergency preparedness director, show how damage would diminish in lesser storms. A Category 2 hurricane -- weaker than the Category 3 storm in 1938 but still stronger than Gloria, with 110 m.p.h. winds -- following the same track as his hypothetical Category 4 and also striking at high tide, would still swamp Long Beach, but the tidal surge would be 14 feet above normal high tide, not 21 feet. There would still be flooding and wind damage across the Island, but many more buildings would remain intact. Using Hazus-MH software, Mr. O'Hara, the ambulance services consultant, studied a possible storm in the Category 2 range hitting at high tide in the Babylon area. He estimated that it would cause $122.5 million in property damage and business interruption in Suffolk and generate 1.45 million tons of debris. Mr. O'Hara's computer studies, combining topographical, storm surge, demographic and building data, project that residences would suffer most of the $24.5 billion in damage that a 1938-type Category 3 storm might do in Suffolk. Members of some 62,000 households would be left homeless, and 37 percent of all buildings in the county would sustain at least moderate damage. A separate study by AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe risk-modeling company in Boston, came up with somewhat different estimates for such a storm. The company, which does most of its work for insurance companies, said if a 1938 hurricane struck today, the total insured losses for the entire Atlantic Coast would be $24.5 billion. S. Ming Lee, a senior vice president of the company, said that of that figure, $11.6 billion in losses would be in New York State, mostly in Nassau and Suffolk. Even so, the damage would be greater than from all four hurricanes that battered Florida last year combined, or even from the strongest storm to hit the United States in memory, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, whose 155 m.p.h. winds devastated South Florida and the Louisiana coast. In dollar-damage terms, it would be a disaster second only to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, which led to more than $30 billion in insurance payments. Insurers say that many Long Island homeowners could be in for a shock after a big hurricane. Those who have not updated their policies to reflect home improvements may find that they have too little insurance to cover replacement costs. Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, said that a study by her group found that 64 percent of all homes in the United States were underinsured, by an average of 27 percent. Federal flood insurance is capped at $250,000, much less than many shorefront homes are worth. Officials consider Long Beach, with 60,000 people living on a low-lying barrier island about 10 feet above sea level, to be the most vulnerable point on Nassau's South Shore. ''It's the weak link, as far as Nassau is concerned,'' said Richard Rotanz, the county's commissioner of emergency management. Emergency plans try to compensate with early evacuation over the three bridges out of the city, two of them at low elevations and certain to flood in a bad storm. At least 18 hours before the predicted landfall of a hurricane, fire sirens are to begin sounding four single blasts, evenly spaced and repeated for 30 minutes. Emergency teams using loudspeakers are to drive through city streets telling residents to leave. ''The biggest thing is early warning,'' said James P. Hennessy, the president of the City Council. The city manager, Charles Theofan, said that Long Beach had to be alert. ''We really are very vulnerable,'' he said. Still, the city has declined to approve a proposal from the Army Corps of Engineers to build new dunes along its beaches as part of a storm protection project. On Fire Island, the most vulnerable coastal area in Suffolk, evacuations would be mostly by ferry, well in advance of a predicted landfall. Gerald Stoddard, the president of the Fire Island Association, a property owners' group, said hurricanes were the general topic of conversation among summer residents. Protecting Fire Island and the entire South Shore from Jones Inlet to Montauk Point has been a bone of contention for years. The Corps of Engineers has been discussing a dune-building and beach-widening project since the 1960's and is now studying a revised plan. But Irving Like, a lawyer for the New York Coastal Partnership, a group of Fire Island and South Shore home and business owners, said that the Interior Department and the corps had failed to comply with a directive from Congress to submit a shore-erosion protection plan for Fire Island by the end of 1999. Close calls with hurricanes do not count with the public, but they are agonizing for emergency officials and meteorologists who are trained to expect the worst. In August 2003, Hurricane Isabel gave them a scare, building up Category 5 winds of 167 m.p.h. and threatening to make landfall anywhere from the Carolinas to eastern Long Island. But wind shear weakened the huge storm while it was still over water, and a high pressure system over New England steered it onto the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where it struck at the low end of the Category 2 range and soon declined to a tropical storm, sparing Long Island. Still, experts say that the Island cannot count on being lucky every time. Long Island"
"Hurricane Katrina pushed ashore north of here as darkness fell on Thursday, laden with heavy rain but not packing much of a wallop. Sustained winds of 80 miles per hour with gusts up to 92 m.p.h. bent palm trees and rattled windows, but there were no reports of heavy damage as the hurricane made landfall between North Miami Beach and Hallandale Beach shortly before 7 p.m. By late Thursday, as much as 12 inches of rain had fallen in some areas, according to estimates by the National Weather Service. More than a million homes and businesses had lost power, The Associated Press reported. Two deaths were reported by Miami television stations. One person was struck by a tree, the other was electrocuted by a downed power line. The storm turned to the southwest after making landfall, passing just northwest of Miami. Its winds were 75 m.p.h., just above minimal hurricane force, at 11 p.m. Thursday. All of the four storms that hit Florida last year packed winds of well over 100 m.p.h., some gusting to well over 140 m.p.h. Several carried strong winds reaching more than 150 miles from the center. By contrast, tropical force winds of about 40 m.p.h. to 70 m.p.h. extended about 80 miles from the Hurricane Katrina's center, said Trisha Wallace, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center here. Colin McAdie, another meteorologist at the center, said that once the storm moved over the gulf today, it was expected to wheel north, pick up speed and hit the Florida Panhandle on Sunday. As the storm approached South Florida, residents took the usual precautions of stocking up on flashlight batteries, water and snacks, and as night fell few drivers were on the windswept streets. For the most part, they seemed to be taking the hurricane in stride. ''I feel pretty comfortable that this is a minor event,'' said Mark Golden as he bought flashlights and water at a Home Depot in Boca Raton, about 40 miles north of here. Mr. Golden said he was not even planning to cover his windows with plywood. Officials cautioned against overconfidence. ''People tend to not take these types of storms very seriously because it's not a major hurricane,'' said Lt. j.g. Jennifer Pralgo, a meteorologist at the hurricane center. ''But they need to. We're urging people to stay home. Most of South Florida is going to get a lot of rain.'' Although there were no mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas, most businesses closed early, and Fort Lauderdale International Airport was closed at 7 p.m. In Miami, one public school in a low-income neighborhood was opened as a shelter. Although major damage was not expected, Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, an insurance trade group, said the hurricane could still ''produce hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.'' The damage is expected to be light but widespread. Instead of hundreds of roofs being ripped off, Mr. Hartwig said, it was more likely that tiles would be blown away, permitting rain to pour into homes. By comparison, the four powerful hurricanes that hit Florida last year cost insurance companies $23 billion. Strong winds from one of those storms brushed South Florida, but no major hurricane has hit the area since 1992, when Hurricane Andrew pummeled vast residential areas on the southern flank of Miami and several towns south of Miami, including Homestead. The damage from Hurricane Andrew came to about $22 billion in today's dollars. Since Hurricane Andrew, Florida officials have imposed strict building codes intended to make homes and offices more wind resistant. In July, the state's first hurricane of the year, Dennis, hit the Florida Panhandle. It caused about $900 million in damage in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. Grocery stores, hardware stores and gasoline stations were busy on Thursday, but the pace was measured. Jugs of water moved off the shelves in ones and twos rather than by the case, as often happens when hurricanes threaten. There were no lines at gas stations or hardware stores. A grocery bagger at a Publix grocery store in Hollywood, north of here, said, ''There's no panicking, just shopping.''"
"The economic engine of Mississippi's Gulf Coast emits not a mechanical roar but a symphony of electronic chimes: the melody of slot machines that attract 60,000 people a day, provide jobs for 17,000 employees and rack up hundreds of millions of dollars daily for the state treasury. But for one of the few times since legal gambling arrived, the casinos that helped revive the Gulf Coast economy went dark early Sunday, shutting down along with scores of other businesses as Hurricane Katrina -- at a top-rated Category 5 -- approached. ''All the casinos were built to withstand a Category 3 hurricane,'' said Susan Barnes, the general manager of the Treasure Bay Casino. ''Beyond that, we are very nervous.'' It was an especially nervous time for Ms. Barnes, who spent Sunday overseeing the final steps of closing down her casino for the storm, chores like wrapping slot machines in plastic and seeing that the cash -- some $40 million -- was picked up by an armored car. Added to that, the Treasure Bay Casino, shaped like a pirate's galleon, is built atop a barge that is moored just off the beach here. The original law that brought legal casinos to Mississippi allowed only gambling cruises. In 1991, the law was changed to say that the ''boats'' where the gambling occurred could be permanently docked and as a result, many of them were built on barges. Since then, the law has been amended again, and most Gulf Coast casinos have land-based amenities like golf courses, theaters and luxury hotels. The most expensive, the Beau Rivage, cost $700 million. The situation could be even worse for casinos that have held on to their riverboat roots. Under orders from the state, the casinos closed their doors to the public at 2 a.m. Sunday and were shut down entirely by midday. While previous storms have caused them to close for a day or two, no hurricane as powerful as this has threatened the casinos since 1992, when the industry took off. There are 27 state-regulated casinos in Mississippi. Seventeen were closed because of the approaching storm, including those as far inland as Vicksburg and Natchez, said Beverly Martin, the executive director of the Mississippi Casino Operators Association. At least some gamblers headed north to Tunica, just below Memphis. Together, the casinos generate $400 million in tax revenue each year. When the Gulf Coast casinos are closed, the cost to the state is $400,000 to $500,000 a day. With 17 closed, tax revenue would drop by at least 50 percent, Ms. Martin said. ''The only reason why it's not two-thirds is because Tunica has a lot of the evacuees,'' she said. And, of course, the casinos lose money during storms even when they are not closed. The drop-off in business began about three days ago, Ms. Martin said. ''The Weather Channel, God bless them,'' she said. Although they are expensive to insure, the casinos are not totally unprotected. Their mooring systems are supposed to withstand wind speeds of 150 miles per hour, said David Kingman, the gaming commission's emergency management liaison. ''If you look, the pilings are in some cases six feet in diameter,'' he said. Katrina is expected to have top winds of 160 miles per hour. Still, Ms. Barnes said that she would not follow a mandatory evacuation order for her neighborhood. ''If it weren't for the Treasure Bay, I would have evacuated,'' she said. ''But I need to be back here for any disaster recovery.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: CASINOS Correction: September 8, 2005, Thursday An article on Aug. 29 about the closing of Mississippi's casinos as Hurricane Katrina approached misspelled the surname of the general manager of the Treasure Bay Casino, who said the casinos were built to withstand a Category 3 hurricane. She is Susan Varnes, not Barnes."
"Energy companies rushed to shut down oil rigs and refineries and evacuate employees in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Katrina approached over the weekend, shrinking oil output in the area at a time when markets are already on edge over surging energy prices. Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange climbed as high as $70.80 a barrel on Sunday night as traders factored in the threat to the most important oil-producing region in the United States. That was up $4.67 from the close on Friday. Oil prices have never risen above $70 a barrel, but when adjusted for inflation they are still lower than they were in the early 1980's. The evacuations, which were mostly completed by Sunday, cut oil production in the Gulf of Mexico by more than 600,000 barrels a day, or more than a third of the area's normal output of 1.5 million barrels a day. Large refining and oil-shipping installations in southern Louisiana, where the hurricane was expected to make landfall early Monday, also shut down over the weekend. ''The oil market is going to be on fire until we figure out exactly what is going on,'' David Pursell, a principal with Pickering Energy Partners in Houston, said in a telephone interview on Sunday. ''There's fear on several fronts, from the capacity of this storm to tear up pipelines on the ocean floor to doing extreme damage to port infrastructure and platforms.'' Speculation about a possible release of oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve led to a drop in oil prices at the end of last week, though traders said talk about such a plan was premature. The Bush administration has been hesitant to release oil from the reserve, which has 700 million barrels of oil, despite calls from Democrats in Congress to do so. The focus on the reserve is bound to intensify as the hurricane takes its toll. The storm is expected to be the biggest disruption to oil production in the gulf since Hurricane Ivan last year, which reduced the area's yearly output by 7 percent after destroying 7 platforms and damaging more than 100 underwater pipelines. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about a quarter of the nation's overall domestic oil production. Gasoline prices for consumers may climb further as refining capacity is stretched by the storm. Chalmette Refinery, which is about 10 miles east of downtown New Orleans and processes 190,000 barrels of oil a day, shut down over the weekend. Calls to officials at Chalmette, a venture between Exxon Mobil and Petróleos de Venezuela, went unanswered on Sunday. Valero Energy said it was shutting down its St. Charles refinery in Louisiana, and Chevron was shutting down a refinery in Pascagoula, Miss., Bloomberg News reported. Elsewhere, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the nation's largest oil-importing terminal, 19 miles off the coast of Louisiana, stopped receiving crude oil from supertankers on Sunday. Altogether, about 6.5 million barrels of crude oil a day are imported along the Gulf Coast, largely to ports in Louisiana and Texas, while roughly 1.5 million barrels of oil a day are produced in domestic waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Royal Dutch Shell, the largest oil producer in the gulf, said in a statement that it had evacuated 983 employees and shut down production of 420,000 barrels of oil and 1.345 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. HURRICANE KATRINA: OIL AND GAS"
"Hurricane Katrina, one of the most powerful storms ever to threaten the United States, bore down on the Gulf Coast on Sunday, sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the approach of its 160-mile-an-hour winds and prompting a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, a city perilously below sea level. ''We are facing a storm that most of us have long feared,'' said Mayor C. Ray Nagin, who issued the order to evacuate. ''This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.'' The hurricane's eye was expected to make landfall around daybreak on Monday in southeastern Louisiana, possibly squarely in New Orleans. The city has avoided a direct hit from a powerful storm since Hurricane Betsy in 1965. In addition to the dangerous winds, Mr. Nagin said, Hurricane Katrina could bring 15 inches of rain and a storm surge of 20 feet or higher that would ''most likely topple'' the network of levees and canals that normally protect the bowl-shaped city from flooding. That possibility was enough for many of the city's 485,000 residents to heed the mayor's call to leave, paralyzing traffic along major highways from just after daybreak and into the evening. ''I probably won't have a house when I go back,'' Tanya Courtney, 25, who lives in the city's French Quarter, said Sunday in Gulfport, Miss., where she and a group of friends bound for Atlanta stopped for a rest. The approaching storm shut down much of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, which is responsible for one-quarter of American oil production. The price of oil rose more than $4 a barrel on Sunday. [Page A12.] Many in New Orleans, including stranded tourists, stayed behind, with as many as 10,000 of them crowding into the Superdome arena, which the city designated as a shelter of last resort. People five and six abreast waited in line for hours to get into the arena, clutching children, blankets and pillows, oversize pieces of luggage or plastic bags filled with belongings. ''When you are on a holiday you don't really follow these kind of things,'' Neil Coffey, 35, a tourist from Britain, said as he stood in line to get into the Superdome. ''We were surprised. We don't get hurricanes like this at home.'' Ernest Paulin Jr., a 55-year-old unemployed welder from New Orleans, said he looked around his three-bedroom wood-frame house where he has lived alone since the death of his wife last year and decided to head for the Superdome. ''I just didn't want to take a chance,'' said Mr. Paulin, who like many arrived with hastily packed possessions. He was carrying a small plastic bag containing his eyeglasses, medication and a paperback book, the Tony Hillerman novel ''First Eagle.'' After crossing South Florida late last week, killing nine people as a weaker storm, Hurricane Katrina intensified over the warm waters of the gulf, growing early Sunday morning into a Category 5 storm, the strongest step on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Since records have been kept, there have only been three Category 5 storms to hit the United States -- Hurricane Andrew, which ravaged Florida and Louisiana in 1992; Hurricane Camille, which cut a path through parts of Mississippi, Louisiana and Virginia in 1969; and an unnamed storm that hit the Florida Keys in 1935. President Bush, vacationing at his ranch in Texas, declared a state of emergency for the Gulf Coast, a move that cleared the way for immediate federal aid. Mr. Bush also urged people in the storm's potential path to head for safer ground. ''We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to Gulf Coast communities,'' he said. The president also participated in a videoconference on Sunday with disaster management officials who were preparing for the storm. And he spoke by telephone with the governors of the four states under immediate threat: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. In an unnervingly quiet New Orleans, many restaurants and stores in the French Quarter were shuttered and hotels, almost all fully booked, struggled to accommodate visitors whose flights had been canceled. The hotels were also a refuge for many residents, who sought rooms above ground level in hope of staying dry. ''We call it a vertical evacuation,'' said Joseph Fein, owner of the Court of Two Sisters, a French Quarter restaurant. Mr. Fein said the city was responding much as it had to many previous hurricane threats, but that Hurricane Katrina was ''the most threatening we have seen.'' At the Omni Royal Orleans hotel, all 346 rooms were booked, with the hotel putting up about 100 employees and members of their families, said Amiri Hayden, the concierge. ''Between guests who are stuck and employees who are staying here, every room is taken,'' Mr. Hayden said. Some out-of-town guests took taxis as far as Baton Rouge, 75 miles away, to find rental car agencies that were open, he said. Louisiana state officials said that at one point during the evacuation of New Orleans on Sunday, more than 18,000 cars an hour were leaving the city. ''I think this storm is bigger than anything we have dealt with before,'' Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. ''This is not a minor problem.'' Officials in Attorney General Charles Foti's office said they were investigating about a half-dozen cases of price gouging, including increased prices on gasoline-powered generators and hotel rooms. The Louisiana Legislature recently passed a law stiffening penalties for price gouging when hurricanes are in the gulf. Farther east on the coast, the party atmosphere promoted by the region's many casinos was nowhere in evidence. Casinos built on barges were dark on Sunday, and people all along the Mississippi Coast were ordered to evacuate. In Gulfport, about 55 miles east of New Orleans, residents feared a repeat of Hurricane Camille, which smashed into the Mississippi Coast in 1969 with winds of 200 miles an hour, killing more than 250 people over several states. ''I'm afraid this is the one we've dreaded,'' said Robert R. Latham Jr., the director of Emergency Management Operations for Mississippi. ''I don't think the scenario could be any worse for us.'' In Gulfport, the authorities were making about a dozen schools and other public buildings available as shelters. But Joe Spraggins, the director of emergency operations for Harrison County, which includes Gulfport and Biloxi to the east, urged residents to go to shelters only as a last resort. Most of the buildings were built years ago, Mr. Spraggins said, and not designed to withstand the anticipated winds of 140 to 150 miles an hour. ''We're asking people to get out of the area,'' he said, ''and to get out fast.'' Yet Mr. Spraggins and other emergency officials acknowledged that the hurricane could chase evacuees on a northeasterly route. Mobile, Ala., expected a storm surge of up to 20 feet, much higher than any it has experienced to date, that could flood its historic downtown. Farther east in the Florida Panhandle, residents of barrier islands were urged to evacuate as Hurricane Katrina began sloshing water onto coastal roads and near homes. ''We're all getting a little tired of going through this drill,'' said Eric Landry of Pensacola, who was shuttering his house on Sunday afternoon, not quite a year after Hurricane Ivan ravaged that city. ''But we're not at the point of moving away. This is just what you have to live with.'' The Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose director, Michael D. Brown, flew to Baton Rouge on Sunday, was waiting to determine where the agency would need to deploy supplies and specialized personnel. A spokeswoman said FEMA had mobilized several hundred specialists, including about 20 medical teams and a smaller number of urban search and rescue teams. The agency has also begun moving water, ice and military Meals Ready to Eat to sites in the Southeast, said the spokeswoman, Natalie Rule. Outside the Superdome, which holds 70,000 people, long lines of evacuees were still waiting in the rain by evening as security forces searched everyone entering for drugs, weapons and other contraband. Cara Every Calderon and her husband, Axel Calderon, flew to New Orleans from their home in Smithtown, N.Y., on Saturday to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. They had reserved four nights at a hotel in the French Quarter, and when Ms. Calderon called to inquire about the storm, she said, the hotel told her, ''Come on down.'' The couple ended up at the Superdome, roller suitcases in tow, after finding themselves trapped. ''We're resilient,'' Ms. Calderon said. ''We're New Yorkers. But this is a little over our heads.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE OVERVIEW"
"As ripples of vapor-filled turbulence began to organize into a storm over the steamy waters of the southeastern Bahamas early last week, Tropical Depression 12 was born, giving few hints that it was an embryonic monster that would grow into Hurricane Katrina. In the 5 p.m. written ''public discussion'' on Tuesday, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami noted that, given the lack of storm-shredding wind shear and the presence of ample heat in the Atlantic, ''at least steady intensification appears to be in order.'' From that time on, the storm kept favoring the upper end of the range of possibilities projected by meteorologists and a half-dozen supercomputer simulations. By Wednesday evening, the hurricane center gave the first hint that what had already become a tropical storm ''could intensify a little more than anticipated'' and might become a small hurricane before striking southern Florida. Still, when it struck Florida about 24 hours later -- killing nine people and knocking out the electricity for a million more -- its power seemed to catch many by surprise. The storm kept ''nudging'' the upper limits of the predictions, said Bill Read, a meteorologist who is tracking the storm for the hurricane center. In an unusual manner, the storm kept its swirling shape and retained its strength as it quickly rumbled across the state. In the Gulf of Mexico, all projections had been that the storm would intensify as it drew energy from the warm waters there, and chance events favored growth. It churned directly over an oceanic feature that is the nemesis of gulf state disaster planners: the ''loop current,'' a great, deep whorl of tropics-hot seawater that pulses in between the Yucatán and Cuba each year and then stays south of Louisiana into late summer. Often, even in the Gulf of Mexico, storms weaken as they suck up cool water that lies stratified beneath the warm surface. But in the loop, even the depths are hot. This ''is like adding high-octane fuel to the fire,'' a Friday night public discussion said. Forecasters then watched in wonder as a series of conditions, many of them poorly understood, caused the storm to do what no one wanted: intensify, expand and maintain a terrifying trajectory. The energy, the near-record low pressure in the storm's core and its huge dimensions added up to an inevitable disaster, Mr. Read said. ''That's why they're basically forecasting Armageddon when it goes inland,'' he said. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE STORM"
"''Is it O.K. to come out?'' Timothy Wagner, a former merchant mariner, standing at what appeared to be a fast-food window that looked out on the main street of Gulfport, Miss., asked for reassurance before venturing into the debris-filled streets. Mr. Wagner had weathered Hurricane Katrina alone in a vacant commercial building, planning, if need be, to lash himself with a garden hose to a steel support post. That was after the walls of his brick apartment building next door had buckled and collapsed in on him. ''When everything started crumbling, I was dodging cinder-blocks,'' he said. ''I'm not a big architect, but I thought it was sound.'' After 45 years in business, the Parks family thought the same thing about their restaurant down the street, the Palace Café. But at the height of the storm, the plywood shielding the windows pulled off and the plate glass exploded into giant shards. ''I had gone to the bathroom and I heard this horrible crash,'' Shirley Parks said. ''I come out and Jimmy was standing there with his arm bleeding.'' Jimmy, Mrs. Parks's son, was cut to the bone, she said. Her husband, Don Parks, stood behind the lunch counter, wearing a garbage bag as if it were a tunic, shaking his head. The chairs were stacked neatly on the tables. The acoustic ceiling tiles lay sodden on the floor. ''Can't talk about it,'' Mr. Parks said. Residents and officials of this city of 71,000 people, one of the hardest hit by the storm, could hardly find the words to describe the devastation: roughly 50 people dead in Harrison County, which includes Gulfport and Biloxi, and more badly injured, according to preliminary reports. The streets clogged with fallen trees and power lines, the fancy casinos with giant holes punched in the outer walls, the collapsed buildings and flattened historic homes. Parking lots under water as choppy as the ocean, wafts of natural gas escaping from broken pipes, a power grid destroyed. No water service. Three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms. Interstate 10, the coast's main traffic artery, submerged. A sailboat, the Endorphin, beached some 400 yards from the water. A 5-year-old boy found on the steps of an office building, alone and in shock. A couple, believed to be his grandparents, found dead. His mother and 8-year-old brother still missing. ''What we're facing is catastrophe,'' Chief Pat Sullivan, of the Gulfport Fire Department, said. ''There's very few buildings that I've seen right now that do not have some type of damage.'' As for the human toll, several bodies were found in a washed-out beachfront apartment complex in Biloxi, officials said. Seven bodies were found in and around the industrial seaway, a manmade canal. One man leaped from his second-story roof to save himself, only to have the house collapse on him, the rescue worker who found him said. The man was in critical condition. ''A lady stopped us and said, 'Take me to my house on Pratt Avenue to get my medicine,''' said Connie Rockco, a county supervisor. ''We said, 'Your house is not there anymore.''' Officials said that eight schools, all being used as shelters, lost their roofs. Countywide, 5,000 people were in shelters, said Oscar A. Barnes Sr. of the American Red Cross. By midafternoon the wind was still so strong that rescue teams were just starting to leave the Harrison County emergency operations center. Their first stop, said Jim Pollard, a spokesman for the center, was Fire Station No. 6, where a man was bleeding from a severed artery. ''They've exhausted everything they can do for him,'' Mr. Pollard said. Later, he said the man had reached Memorial Hospital alive. The emergency centers in neighboring counties had been hit. There was no word on how long it would take to restore power, lift the curfew or reverse the evacuation order that had been issued as night approached. ''We have no way right now to determine how badly we've been hurt,'' Chief Sullivan said. He said he had no idea how many residents had stayed home in defiance of the mandatory evacuation. ''I am personally aware of several people that had to ride the storm out on their roof,'' he said. ''There were a number of houses that were actually gone, nothing but debris.'' Right off Highway 49, men waded through waist-high water, pushing skiffs full of people down a street that looked like a lake. ''My house is flooded,'' said Rhonda Green, 44, who had reached the highway safe, but damp. ''I'm talking about deep-freezer-floating-in-the-water flooded.'' Outside the plate-glass lobby of the Holiday Inn on Monday morning, the wind whipped so fast that twisted metal, flying fast, almost left contrails swirling through the bending trees. Bill Gibson, who owns a car rental business, stood watching a wooden fence flop back and forth, hitting some of his cars with each flop. ''Go ahead and leave my van alone,'' Mr. Gibson said. He said he habitually parked his cars in the Holiday Inn lot during storms, because the lot was less likely to flood than the airport. But this time, he said, several windows had already blown out. His wife and son were safe, staying well inland in his daughter's dorm room at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. But he was not sure about their property in Diamondhead, to the west. ''We'll see if I have a home left,'' Mr. Gibson said. ''And a cat.'' Chief Sullivan said many neighborhoods south of the railroad tracks, closest to the beach, were destroyed. The Parks family said their insurance had been canceled because their cafe was south of the tracks. ''I don't know if I'm going to rebuild,'' Mr. Parks said. Mr. Wagner, who said that as a merchant mariner he had survived a hurricane at sea, had acted pragmatically. He had escaped this time with a briefcase holding his tax papers and passport, and a knapsack containing some Vienna sausages. ''When you live in a place like this,'' he said, ''you've got to rebuild all the time. We're like ants on the beach.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: GULFPORT"
"Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf Coast with devastating force at daybreak on Monday, sparing New Orleans the catastrophic hit that had been feared but inundating parts of the city and heaping damage on neighboring Mississippi, where it killed dozens, ripped away roofs and left coastal roads impassable. Officials said that according to preliminary reports, there were at least 55 deaths, with 50 alone in Harrison County, Miss., which includes Gulfport and Biloxi. Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings. Jim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway. Packing 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center. The storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record. In New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees took shelter. Some of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable. ''It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks,'' Gov. Haley Barbour said at a midday news conference ''It's a terrible storm.'' President Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses. In Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority, but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest-hit areas. The governors sent out the police and the National Guard after reports of looting, and officials in some parts of Louisiana said they would impose a curfew. Hurricane Katrina was downgraded from Category 5 -- the most dangerous storm -- to Category 4 as it hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m., and in New Orleans officials said the storm's slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat. The city is below sea level, and there had been predictions that the historic French Quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water. Still, no one was finding much comfort here, with 100 m.p.h. winds and water surges of up to 15 feet. Officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled. ''I can't say that we've escaped the worst,'' Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. ''I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city. We don't even know what the worst is.'' Preliminary damage estimates from the hurricane -- which raked across southern Florida last week as a Category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and making its run at the Gulf Coast -- ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion. Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier -- with nearly $21 billion in insured losses. Beyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds, Hurricane Katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region. Both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the Mississippi Gulf Coast shut down on Sunday as the storm approached. Since Friday, oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has been cut by 3.1 million barrels. Closing the casinos cost Mississippi $400,000 to $500,000 a day in lost tax revenue alone, and Mr. Barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos. The storm pounded New Orleans for eight hours straight. Flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown. On the southern shore of the lake, entire neighborhoods of one-story homes were flooded to the rooflines, with nearby off-ramps for Interstate 10 looking like boat ramps amid the waves. Along the lake were snapped telephone poles, trees blocking roads and live wires scattered over the roads. In one cabin, a family was cooking a chicken dinner over charcoal briquettes on a hibachi. They had lost power like everyone else in the area. Windows were blown off condominiums, hotels, office buildings and Charity Hospital, sending chards of glass into the winds. Fires broke out despite torrential rain, some ignited, the authorities said, by residents who lighted candles after the electricity went out. The storm knocked out telephone and cellular service across swaths of the gulf region, and officials in New Orleans said parts of the city could remain without power for weeks. Two nuclear plants near the path of Hurricane Katrina appear to have weathered the storm without major damage, and a third shut down on Saturday, in anticipation of the hurricane, according to Entergy Nuclear, which owns all three. The extent of damage to the plant that shut down, Waterford, 20 miles west of New Orleans, was still unknown late Monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look, said Diane Park, a spokeswoman. The more sparsely populated parishes east of New Orleans, meanwhile, got hit much harder than anyone had expected. Ms. Blanco said Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson and St. Tammany Parishes had been ''devastated by high winds and floodwaters.'' In St. Bernard, the emergency center was submerged, and officials estimated that 40,000 homes, too, were flooded. Parish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their roofs. Officials estimated 80 percent of New Orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate. But in areas that had been expecting less damage, officials were worried -- and annoyed -- that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm. In Plaquemines and Terrebonne Parishes, south and west of the city, officials said they were particularly concerned about commercial fisherman who had decided to remain on their boats. ''My biggest concern is the loss of life,'' said State Senator Walter J. Boasso. ''We have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics, and I don't know if we will get to them fast enough.'' In Mississippi, Mr. Barbour said many people suffered from what he called ''hurricane fatigue,'' deciding not to evacuate this time after having done so in the past only to be spared. ''We pray that those people are O.K.,'' he said. ''But we don't know.'' In Diamondhead, Miss., Don Haller and his 17-year-old son, Don Jr., were left clinging to the remains of their house when a 23-foot surge of water hit it, flexing the roof like a deck of cards. They had decided against evacuating, Mr. Haller said, judging the storm ''just a lot of rain.'' ''We rode the house,'' Mr. Haller said, emerging from the waters here, his son carrying their dachshund, Kuddles. Mr. Barbour said casinos along the coast near Biloxi and Gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet. But casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage, he said, because U.S. 90 had ''essentially been destroyed.'' Along the coast in Mobile, Ala., 150 miles east of New Orleans, thousands of evacuees from Mississippi and Louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open. The lowest-lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin Counties in Alabama were evacuated on Sunday night. By noon, areas south of Interstate 10 were already flooding, and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of Mobile and Mobile Bay as the hurricane progressed. Downtown Mobile, which is right on the bay, was severely flooded by Monday afternoon, the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the Mobile Museum. Water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters, and large, heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets. The main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding, causing concerns that they, too, would be flooded, at least in the main floors. And as power and phone lines went down, evacuees were getting restless. Paul Weir said he had not left his home in Meraux, La., just outside New Orleans, during a storm since Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and left on Sunday morning only after hearing that Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5. He drove with his wife, daughter and four friends to Mobile; with roads clogged with other residents fleeing, what is normally a three-hour drive took 12. By Monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find when they got home. ''If I was home, I would've went on a roof for two days just like everybody else,'' said Susan Weir, Mr. Weir's wife, said. ''I'd rather be in that situation than here, honestly. This is expensive and I've only got a credit card with a $2,000 limit.'' At the Ramada Hotel in downtown Mobile, Edith Frieson sat anxiously in a soggy room wondering why her husband had not returned. ''He left maybe three hours ago to go down and see if he could check the house,'' said Mrs. Frieson, who lives on Dauphin Island, a narrow barrier island south of Mobile. The island was already flooding on Sunday afternoon. Like most storms, Hurricane Katrina weakened as it came onshore, and by Monday evening the National Hurricane Center had downgraded it to a tropical storm. The center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward Jackson, Miss. But state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one, causing a wide swath of damage, and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks. In Louisiana, Ms. Blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back. ''The roads are flooded, the power is out, the phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down,'' she said. ''Wherever you live, it is still too dangerous for people to return home,'' she continued. ''If you evacuated and you're in a shelter, if you're with friends and family, please, please stay there. Stay safe.'' Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed. ''Be careful,'' Mr. Brown said, standing next to the governor at a news conference. ''Don't get in that water. Watch for downed power lines. If you're going to use a chainsaw, know how to use a chainsaw. If you're going to have a generator, know how to exercise and operate the generator. Be very, very careful. The storm is not over.'' Mr. Brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked. Even before the hurricane hit the New Orleans area, FEMA had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region. It also delivered generators, and stockpiles of water, ice and ready-to-eat meals. It even sent in two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals. As of early Monday, about 52,000 people were in 240 shelters in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida and Texas, with the majority in the Superdome in New Orleans. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE OVERVIEW"
"The damage caused by a hurricane like Katrina is almost always called a natural disaster. But it is also unnatural, in the sense that much of it is self-inflicted. New Orleans is no exception, and while the city has been spared a direct hit from the storm, its politicians and planners must rethink the bad policies that contributed to the city's vulnerability. An immediate priority is for the Senate to restore some $70 million that the House, in a singular act of poor timing, slashed from the Army Corps of Engineers' budget for the New Orleans district. The cuts could hurt the corps' ability to rebuild levees protecting the city. Meanwhile, the city itself must attend to a pumping system that is much in need of upgrading. At the same time, there must also be an honest recognition of the fact that no amount of engineering -- levees, sea walls, pumping systems, satellite tracking systems -- can fully bring nature to heel. Indeed, the evidence is indisputable that systematic levee-building along the Mississippi upstream of New Orleans has blocked much of the natural flow of silt into the delta. That, in turn, has caused the delta to subside and made the city and its environs even more vulnerable to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which itself has been rising. Upstream levee-building has also had the effect of turning a sluggish river into a fire hose, helping to destroy marshes and barrier islands that once provided some protection. The steady destruction of coastal wetlands by residential development and years of oil and gas drilling hasn't helped much either. The combination of subsiding land and rising seas has put the Mississippi Delta about three feet lower than it was 100 years ago. All this, in turn, lends urgency to plans proposed by Louisiana politicians to restore natural hurricane protections by diverting water and silt from the river to coastal marshes and wetlands, and by rebuilding barrier islands. The effort is expected to take more than 40 years and cost an estimated $14 billion, substantially more than the $8 billion Everglades restoration project. The administration budgeted $20 million for the project this year, mainly for the necessary planning studies. A lot more than that is going to be needed. New Orleans must learn to take care of nature if it hopes to survive it."
"Insurance companies said yesterday that damage from Hurricane Katrina could top $9 billion, making it one of the costliest storms on record. While the extent of the damages will not be known for days, estimates yesterday from insurers ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion -- down from $15 billion to $30 billion on Sunday. Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, said: ''While financially painful, the storm will not put any insurers or reinsurers under financial duress. They will be able to pay all these claims.'' Hurricane Andrew, which ravaged parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, ranks as the costliest hurricane in American history, with nearly $21 billion in insured losses, in 2004 dollars, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Last year, four hurricanes -- Charley, Ivan, Frances and Jeanne -- combined to register almost $23 billion in losses in the Southeast, mostly in Florida. Hurricane Charley was the most costly of the four, with about $7.5 billion in damages. Since last year, insurance rates for Florida homeowners have increased 15 to 30 percent, Mr. Hartwig said. Rates have risen along coastal areas of the Southeast for several years to cover what meteorologists expect to be more frequent and more intense hurricanes in the next two decades. ''It's too early to talk about potential losses,'' said Ray Stone, vice president for catastrophe operations at St. Paul Travelers. ''But compared to yesterday's prediction of a 175-mile-per-hour storm making a beeline for New Orleans, we're breathing a sigh of relief.'' Financial analysts said the insurance industry was financially capable of handling the claims. The domestic industry has a capital base of more than a $400 billion, said Peter C. Streit, a property and casualty insurance analyst at the Williams Capital Group, which should inoculate it from bankruptcies and the need to tap the capital markets for supplemental financing. ''They're in much better shape than they were just a couple of years ago,'' Mr. Streit said. Another analyst agreed, and noted that the lack of a sharp sell-off in insurance stocks suggested that traders were confident that providers would be more than capable of handling claims from Hurricane Katrina. ''From a trading perspective, if the scenes started to look horrific, that could cause panic in the group,'' said the analyst, Clifford Gallant of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''But we're not seeing that -- the market is acting pretty rationally.'' Eqecat, a risk management firm in Oakland, Calif., that was predicting damages of $9 billion to $16 billion as of yesterday, said damages would have been higher if the storm had not veered east of New Orleans. ''New Orleans missed a worst-case scenario,'' the company president, Richard L. Clinton, said. ''It's still going to be impacted significantly.'' Mr. Clinton said a large amount of the damage would be related to business losses from oil production operations in the Gulf of Mexico. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE COST"
"State National Guard units, already strained by long overseas deployments, joined federal, state and private organizations yesterday in a broad effort to provide relief in areas thrashed and flooded by Hurricane Katrina. The American Red Cross said it was undertaking one of the largest emergency operations in its history, and federal disaster-relief teams descended on stricken areas across the Gulf Coast. Private volunteer groups prepared to deliver hot meals to hundreds of thousands of residents made refugees by the storm and the flooding it caused. Even before the storm hit the coast, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had positioned 23 disaster medical assistance teams and seven search and rescue teams around the region. It also delivered generators, tarps and stockpiles of water, ice and ready-to-eat meals, agency officials said. FEMA also sent two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals. More than 5,000 National Guard troops were called up over the weekend to assist in relief operations, despite the burden of providing troops to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tens of thousands more may be called as the extent of the damage becomes clear, officials said. National Guard officials said many of the troops mobilized for storm duty had recently returned from overseas combat zones. Some 3,500 Louisiana National Guard troops were on active duty to help with housing, security, power generation, food distribution and debris removal, with 6,500 more available. Mississippi called up 850 National Guard troops, and Alabama mobilized more than 1,500. Officials said nearly 100,000 additional members of the Guard from the Southeast were available on short notice. The Alabama contingent includes military police, engineers and Special Forces who have all recently served in Iraq or Afghanistan, according to Lt. Col. Robert Horton of the Alabama National Guard. ''We are prepared to respond to any natural disaster and to support the war on terrorism,'' Colonel Horton said. ''We just have to deal with both missions.'' The National Guard units were joined by thousands of volunteers and public workers in one of the largest emergency mobilization efforts in recent years. The American Red Cross said it had opened 239 shelters by last night and sent 166 emergency response vehicles and thousands of volunteers to the stricken area, according to a spokeswoman, Renita Hosler. Ms. Hosler said the Red Cross response would probably surpass its efforts last year when four hurricanes ripped across Florida in quick succession. The agency spent roughly $130 million on hurricane relief programs last year, she said. Along with the Red Cross, relief agencies, including the Southern Baptist Disaster Relief Fund and Spirit of America, a humanitarian group, moved in mobile kitchens and had prepared more than a half million hot meals for evacuees by last night, officials said. If necessary, FEMA has 500 truckloads of ice, 500 of water and 350 of meals available to distribute over the next 10 days, an official said. Michael D. Brown, the agency's director, said in a telephone interview last night that agency-sponsored search and rescue teams had not entered the disaster zone because they were waiting for the worst of the storm to pass. ''There were no secure areas to put them in frankly,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We are talking teams of 80 people.'' Mark Smith, the chief information officer for the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, urged the hundreds of thousands of people who fled southeastern Louisiana ahead of the storm to stay where they were. Mr. Smith said late yesterday that power and communications had been cut off in much of the affected region and that state officials had not had a chance to assess damage or to rescue people trapped in more remote areas of the state. HURRICANE KATRINA: RESCUE EFFORTS"
"The Gulf Coast has always been vulnerable to coastal storms, but over the years people have made things worse, particularly in Louisiana, where Hurricane Katrina struck yesterday. Since the 18th century, when French colonial administrators required land claimants to establish ownership by building levees along bayous, streams and rivers, people have been trying to dominate the region's landscape and the forces of its nature. As long as people could control floods, they could do business. But, as people learned too late, the landscape of South Louisiana depends on floods: it is made of loose Mississippi River silt, and the ground subsides as this silt consolidates. Only regular floods of muddy water can replenish the sediment and keep the landscape above water. But flood control projects channel the river's nourishing sediment to the end of the birdfoot delta and out into the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico. Although early travelers realized the irrationality of building a port on shifting mud in an area regularly ravaged by storms and disease, the opportunities to make money overrode all objections. When most transport was by water, people would of course settle along the Mississippi River, and of course they would build a port city near its mouth. In the 20th century, when oil and gas fields were developed in the gulf, of course people added petrochemical refineries and factories to the river mix, convenient to both drillers and shippers. To protect it all, they built an elaborate system of levees, dams, spillways and other installations. As one 19th-century traveler put it, according to Ari Kelman, an environmental historian at the University of California, Davis, ''New Orleans is surprising evidence of what men will endure, when cheered by the hopes of an ever-flowing tide of dollars and cents.'' In the last few decades, more and more people have realized what a terrible bargain the region made when it embraced -- unwittingly, perhaps -- environmental degradation in exchange for economic gains. Abby Sallenger, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey who has studied the Louisiana landscape for years, sees the results of this bargain when he makes his regular flights over the Gulf Coast or goes by boat to one of the string of sandy barrier islands that line the state's coast. The islands are the region's first line of defense against hurricane waves and storm surges. Marshes, which can normally absorb storm water, are its second. But, starved of sediment, the islands have shrunk significantly in recent decades. And though the rate of the marshes' loss has slowed somewhat, they are still disappearing, ''almost changing before your eyes,'' as Dr. Sallenger put it in a telephone interview from his office in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''Grassland turns into open water, ponds turn into lakes.'' Without the fine sediment that nourishes marshes and the coarser sediment that feeds eroding barrier islands, ''the entire delta region is sinking,'' he said. In effect, he said, it is suffering a rise in sea level of about a centimeter -- about a third of an inch -- a year, 10 times the average rate globally. ''Some of the future projections of sea level rise elsewhere in the country due to global warming would approach what we presently see in Louisiana,'' Dr. Sallenger said. Hurricane Katrina was a strong storm, Category 4, when it came ashore east of New Orleans, near a string of barriers called the Chandeleur Islands. ''They were already vulnerable, extremely so,'' Dr. Sallenger said. He said he and his colleagues were reviewing photos, radar images and other measurements made of the islands after Hurricane Lili, a Category 2 hurricane that passed over them in 2002. ''The degree of change in that storm was extreme,'' he said. ''So we had a discussion this morning: O.K., if Lili can do this, who knows what Katrina is going to do?'' The scientists expect to fly over the coast on Wednesday and find out. Of course, New Orleans is vulnerable to flooding from the Mississippi River as well as from coastal storms. North of the city, the Army Corps of Engineers has marked out several places where the levees would be deliberately breached in the event of a potentially disastrous river flood threat, sending water instead into uninhabited ''spillways.'' But there is no way to stop a hurricane storm surge from thundering over a degraded landscape -- except, perhaps, by restoring the landscape to let the Mississippi flow over it more often. Some small efforts are being made. For example, at the Old River Control Structure, an installation of dams, turbines and other facilities just north of Baton Rouge that keeps the Mississippi on its established path, workers collect sediment that piles along the dams and cart it by truck into the marshes. But truly letting the river run would exact unacceptably heavy costs -- costs that would be paid immediately by people in the region and in particular by any politician rash enough to endorse such a plan. Instead, there continue to be efforts to build more capacity into New Orleans flood control efforts, said Craig E. Colten, a geographer at Louisiana State University and the author of a new book, ''An Unnatural Metropolis: Wresting New Orleans From Nature'' (Louisiana State University Press, 2005). That will mean ever more costs, Mr. Colten said, given that the city, which is below sea level, must run pumps simply to keep from being flooded in an ordinary rainstorm. Roy K. Dokka, a geologist at Louisiana State, said flooding would be even worse for decades to come, not just in New Orleans but in the entire Gulf Coast region. The consequences were clear yesterday, Dr. Dokka said, around Port Fourchon, La., where the single road that is the commuting route for oil workers heading to offshore rigs lay under water. ''That road that all the roughnecks and oil workers drive down every day has sunk a foot in 20 years,'' he said. ''It's now under water every time there's a significant south wind blowing.'' But as Dr. Kelman said: ''Once you've invested enough in urban infrastructure, you have to keep on buying in. And that doesn't even count the cultural dimension.'' The reference was to the region's cuisine, culture and mystique. ''With billions of dollars sunk into the soil in southern Louisiana and the Gulf Coast,'' Dr. Kelman said, ''it's kind of too late. We're there, and we're staying there.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: GEOGRAPHY"
"The oak tree crashed through Terry Milton's bedroom ceiling just before dawn on Monday. Then Mr. Milton opened the front door on his old brick house and a waist-high wall of water nearly knocked him down. He yelled to his fiancée, his best friend and six relatives to get out of the house. Then he rousted his sister and three others next door. With thrashing tree limbs whipping them around and floodwater surging over eastern New Orleans, the women and children clambered into a boat that a neighbor had left behind. Mr. Milton and the other men clung to the side. As they rounded a corner, crying for help, three people on a second-floor balcony being lapped by the water pulled them to relative safety. But their ordeal was not over. The hurricane was just starting and through most of the day the flood waters rose and fell, rose and fell, threatening to inundate the house. The building shook and quivered in the staggering, gusting wind. ''I thought I was going to lose my life,'' Mr. Milton said. By late afternoon, the city police and rescuers had begun venturing out to look for stranded victims of Hurricane Katrina; no one knew how many people were in trouble. The worst damage in the city was thought to be in Mr. Milton's neighborhood, a mostly poor area known as the Lower Ninth Ward. Downtown New Orleans and the French Quarter appeared to have been spared as the eye of the powerful storm passed just east of the city. Dire predictions of 20-foot-deep toxic rivers running in the streets and huge buildings coming apart did not materialize. Instead, most of the city was left fairly in disarray, with trees and branches and power lines down, canvas awnings and store signs lost, and some streets under a foot or two of water. A huge chunk of the white rubbery fabric that covers the Superdome arena was torn away and thousands of people who had taken shelter there were soaked, but none were hurt, the authorities said. Hundreds of windows were blown out in some of the big hotels, office buildings and condominiums, and scores of cars, parked on the streets, were flooded and left with broken glass. But many big buildings lost only a few windows or, in some cases, it appeared, none at all. The French Quarter was a mess of torn tree limbs and shrubs, and a smattering of broken roofs and masonry. But Galatoire's, the famous French restaurant, seemed barely touched and there was no sign of serious harm at the equally renowned Cafe du Monde, nearby. Palm trees along the center of Canal Street were uprooted and a few street-level shops were ripped open by the wind. All over town traffic signals lay on the ground. Even with much less destruction than expected, though, the cost of repairs could easily run into the billions. Recovery will take months. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost electricity, city officials said, and it may take weeks for some of them to get it back. Two hospitals, Charity Hospital and Baptist Hospital, were heavily damaged, said Deputy Fire Chief Joseph R. Matthews, who is also the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management. On Camp Street at Gravier, the brick facade came loose from an old four-story building, burying a beige Land Rover and a white Pontiac. Throughout the city scattered houses and condominiums were torn up. Some lost roofs. Others simply collapsed. Fires broke out and burned wildly even in the torrential rain, some of them ignited, the authorities said, as people used candles so they could see. An entire wall of a five-story condominium in the Algiers section, just across the Mississippi River, was torn off. Somehow none of the dozen or so people still staying there were hurt, the authorities said. During the storm, scores of desperate calls for help poured into the emergency operations center in a vaultlike section of City Hall. They were recorded with mechanical self-control by operators who usually handle 911 lines. ''Residence has collapsed,'' one operator said as she passed the information to supervisors shortly after 7 a.m. ''Flooding inside.'' ''Female unable to breathe; she is oxygen-dependent,'' she reported a few minutes later. ''House on fire,'' the woman said, after her next call. Moments later: ''Another fire.'' ''Two males on a roof, water rising.'' ''Water up to windows,'' she reported after another call. ''People screaming that I'm drowning.'' ''Elderly couple in a building,'' she said. ''Roof came off.'' So it went through the day, but all the authorities could do was note the location and urge people to hang on. ''We couldn't send our officers out in the storm,'' Chief Matthews said later. ''We couldn't put them at risk.'' The winds died down enough by midafternoon for rescuers to head toward the Lower Ninth Ward in shallow-draft boats. Already a struggling neighborhood, it is even worse off now. Officials said a levee protecting the area may have succumbed, though residents thought the flooding might have been a surge from the Gulf of Mexico. As night fell more than 200 people from the area clustered along the side of the St. Cloud Bridge, drying out after they were saved from the balconies, roofs and attics of submerged houses. Qiana Mack, 28, who is unemployed, and her partner, Jonathan Sylvester, 22, a day laborer, had awakened at 8 a.m., surrounded by water. ''Our bed was floating,'' Ms. Mack said. ''We swam out a window to a neighbor's porch, then got into her attic.'' But after four hours, the attic was flooding. ''We knocked out a vent and crawled through that to get to the roof,'' Ms. Mack said. The couple stayed balanced on the peak of the roof, the only thing sticking out of the water, for four hours. ''They couldn't get a boat close to us,'' Ms. Mack said. ''So they threw us life preservers and scuba divers helped us swim to the boat.'' Dion Richardson, who dragged Terry Milton and the others onto her second-story porch, said that like many of the others, she ignored warnings to evacuate because she thought Hurricane Katrina would be ''another false alarm.'' ''We evacuated last year for Hurricane Ivan,'' she said, ''and nothing happened.'' Mr. Milton, 26, gets along on disability payments from Social Security. His fiancée, Alison Berryhill, works as a parking lot cashier. ''We lost everything,'' Ms. Berryhill said. Harvey Lewis, 35, a security guard, and his wife, Didra, 33, and their four children headed for Texas Saturday night in their van. But the van began heating up and they decided to return home. As the flood engulfed the family Monday, Mr. Lewis hoisted the children onto the top of a free-standing closet in their bedroom. Then he and his wife climbed up, too. They were rescued after sitting up there for hours as the winds hammered their house, worrying that they would never get out. ''We held hands and prayed,'' Mr. Lewis said. HURRICANE KATRINA: NEW ORLEANS"
"Standing 60 feet above sea level on this oil platform 130 miles southeast of New Orleans, Rab Bruce pointed to where the huge wave slammed into a tangle of grated steel and multicolor pipes. ''I was just in shock at the damage,'' said Mr. Bruce, a longtime field coordinator on Chevron's Petronius deepwater platform, which was hit by a 90-foot wave during Hurricane Ivan last September. ''I had never seen anything like this. Everything was busted, dangling and messed up.'' Today, with oil prices hitting records and petroleum producers stretched to the limit to meet greater demand from not just the United States but from China, India and other developing countries as well, oil producers worry that hurricanes are as much a risk to a global shortfall in supplies as pipelines blowing up in Iraq or oil workers going on strike in Venezuela. And with the margin of error so tight, even a temporary disruption of the deepwater platforms, rigs and sub-sea pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico -- a region that pumps one-quarter of American oil production -- could create big problems for energy producers and consumers alike. ''It's a new version of the butterfly effect,'' said Larry Goldstein, the president of PIRA Energy Group, an oil consultancy in New York. ''A hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico can lead to higher prices around the world. That's how vulnerable oil markets are today to events outside of our control. And it shows how little room there is for errors.'' The hurricane season this year has kicked off to its fastest start since 1851, with seven tropical storms, including two major hurricanes, reaching the gulf since June. On Tuesday, meteorologists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stepped up their storm warnings and said they now expected an ''extremely active season'' with up to 21 tropical storms and up to 7 major storms. Last year, Hurricane Ivan, one of the worst to hit the gulf in the last decade, destroyed 7 platforms in shallow waters, and severely damaged 24 facilities and 102 underwater pipelines. It was the most costly storm ever to hit the offshore sector, causing an estimated $2.7 billion in damage, according to International Petroleum Finance. It took six months to repair damaged installations, fix severed pipelines and return oil and gas production to prestorm levels. In total, the storm cut 43.8 million barrels of oil, or 7 percent of the gulf's yearly output. It curbed gas production by 172 billion cubic feet, or 4 percent of the total yearly output, and cost an estimated $3 billion in lost oil and gas revenue. As the extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Ivan sank in, oil prices on commodity markets surged 19 percent over the next two weeks, pushing above $50 a barrel last October. Oil is now trading at around $60 a barrel. ''The world has changed,'' said Frank Glaviano, the vice president for production for North and South America at Royal Dutch Shell, the biggest oil producer in the gulf. ''Given the supply and demand situation around the world, it's true that any disruption in supplies is more important to markets than it was in previous years.'' The largest storm to hit so far this year was Hurricane Dennis, which made landfall near Pensacola, Fla., on July 10. Nearly all of the 30,000 people who work offshore at any given time had to be evacuated; the storm halted 96 percent of the gulf's oil production for a day. A few days later, Hurricane Emily, which took a southerly course, forced the shutdown of Mexico's offshore industry as well as loading ports, curtailing the crude exports of one of the United States' top suppliers. And it is still early in the season. Like many analysts and traders, Roger Diwan, an oil analyst at PFC Energy, said he now monitored the national hurricane center's Web site every day for signs of storms. ''Ivan had a long, lingering effect because of the damage it caused and because it hit the market with a perception -- and a reality -- of a lack of supplies,'' Mr. Diwan said. ''In that sense, it heightened the fear of hurricanes this year.'' Stretching 200 miles into the gulf's warm waters, more than 4,000 platforms -- some as small as a fire hydrant -- prod, plow and pump the surface below the sea for hydrocarbons. There are so many man-made structures that at times it might seem as if visitors could hop back to shore without getting their feet wet. This makes the region particularly vulnerable. The gulf accounts for a daily oil production of 1.5 million barrels and 11.2 billion cubic feet a day of gas. ''We have concentrated our facilities where the natural phenomenon of hurricanes occurs,'' said Alan Verret, the executive director of the Offshore Operators Committee, an industry trade group. ''If a storm is going to hit, it is going to affect everything in the area and there is nothing we can do about it. We've put all our eggs in the same basket.'' Thanks to new drilling and undersea technology, the Gulf of Mexico has become America's latest and most prolific exploration frontier and the only region in the nation where production is projected to grow in coming years. One area in particular is responsible for that growth: the gulf's deep waters, which are home to the largest platforms, including Petronius. By 2013, production in the gulf is expected to reach 2.1 million barrels a day, according to forecasts by the Minerals Management Service, a unit of the Interior Department in charge of administering offshore production. Gas production is expected to reach 13.5 billion cubic feet a day. The techniques pioneered here -- such as pumping oil from ground below 10,000 feet of water and drilling 30,000-foot horizontal wells -- have been exported around the world to places like the deep waters off Western Africa and the Caspian Sea, allowing oil companies to expand their reach in the search for oil. The minerals service, in a recent report, estimated that the gulf's deep offshore region holds ultimate reserves of 71 billion barrels of oil -- an amount that would satisfy America's current domestic consumption for nearly 10 years. Two-thirds of those reserves have yet to be found. The challenge for oil companies is that projects have grown in size and cost as the shallower deposits run out. Developing a deepwater field can exceed $1 billion, compared with $100 million for a typical shallow-water development in 100 feet of water. But as projects grow, so do the risks. Last month, the world's largest semisubmersible platform, a $1 billion investment by BP and Exxon Mobil, nearly sank after Hurricane Dennis swept through the area. The platform, one of BP's top projects for the decade, was found tilting at a 20-degree angle after the passage of the storm. It took six days of work to right the structure, called Thunder Horse. The incident has delayed for months production of up to 250,000 barrels of oil a day, which was supposed to start in October. But the infrastructure above the water is just part of the risk. Nearly a third of the gulf's production comes from underwater wells linked to above-water hubs; the entire gulf is crisscrossed by 33,000 miles of pipelines, some buried, some just lying on the seabed. That network, responsible for bringing production back on shore, proved particularly vulnerable to the underwater currents and storm surge created by Hurricane Ivan. ''The pipes, it's like spaghetti out there,'' said Chris C. Oynes, the regional director of the Minerals Management Service in New Orleans. ''When the storm hit, it's like when you're sitting in your bathtub and the water is pushed to the wall and comes back to you.'' The storm surge created powerful forces on the sea floor that severely damaged the pipelines. For example, one critical pipeline, 24 inches in diameter, was uprooted and pushed some 2,000 feet from its original position. Piecing that network back together was one of the main factors that delayed the resumption of production in the gulf. The industry is now pondering some of the lessons from Hurricane Ivan. One issue is whether the new platforms are high enough to clear waves like the ones produced by Hurricane Ivan. ''We probably need some heavy-duty fine-tuning,'' Mr. Oynes said. ''Oil companies have a big stake in this. Certainly with oil above $50 a barrel, it was not wise to have Petronius closed for so long. Even if the oil was not lost but just delayed, their cash flow was hurt. They have a strong incentive in this.'' Nearly a year later, there are still signs of the powerful blows that Petronius sustained from last year's brutal storm, like a large supporting steel beam on the lower deck that remains visibly bent. Most of the rest has been repaired at a cost of some $50 million after a six-month closure. Although not directly under the eye of the storm, Petronius bore the brunt of it. On Sept. 16, the day after the hurricane moved through the gulf, a Chevron helicopter made a flyover to inspect the damage and found it could not land on the platform. The helipad was gone. So were the sleeping quarters and the galley, which had all been blown away. The first team did not arrive until the next Sunday, after a journey by boat, four days after the storm. ''Over all, the design criteria was the right one,'' said Bob Squires, the Chevron engineer who led the repair effort on Petronius. The structure, 120 feet high, sits on top of a 1,700-foot tower attached to the seafloor. The platform, which produces 42,000 barrels of oil a day, is the world's tallest self-supported structure, higher than the Sears Tower or two Eiffel towers on top of each other. Mr. Squires said that the platform had been built to withstand a 100-year storm. But Hurricane Ivan, he said, was much more powerful than those forecasts. ''It was more like a 1,000- or 2,000-year storm,'' he said. ''That we were just in the path of one -- well, it was just bad luck.''"
"Hurricane season is a time of worry for anyone who owns a home in Florida. But it is an even bigger concern for Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of Allstate Insurance, which insures more than 750,000 homes in Florida and hundreds of thousands more in neighboring states. Terrorism has also become a concern for Mr. Liddy. While an attack on an individual home may seem improbable, experts say hundreds of homes could be destroyed in a strike on one of the scores of strategic targets in the United States that are surrounded by residential areas. Hurricanes, though, are particularly on Mr. Liddy's mind this year because of the havoc caused last year when a record four major storms hammered Florida, leaving almost no part of the state untouched and costing Allstate and other insurers $22.9 billion. Mr. Liddy talked recently about hurricanes and terrorism and their impact on Allstate and its customers. Q. What goes through your head as a killer hurricane is approaching? A. Fear. And concern for our policyholders. These are devastating storms. They can wipe out communities. They don't just destroy homes. They can destroy a family's heritage. All their belongings, their scrapbooks. Everything. They can also be devastating for our company and our shareholders. Our whole claims organization has to go into an incredible work overload and our capital can be strained. Q. You've announced that you are not going to renew coverage for 95,000 homeowners in Florida. That's pretty drastic. Why are you taking this step? A. We think we have too much exposure in Florida. We have to strike a balance. We estimated the worst case scenario and we simply were insuring too many homes in the state of Florida. We're limited by regulators in what we can charge. And the rates the state allows us to charge simply wasn't enough to cover our potential losses. For the financial safety of the company we had to cut back. Q. What are these people going to do for coverage? A. Several new companies have come into Florida. One of them is offering coverage to our customers. In many cases they're able to charge a higher rate, a more appropriate rate than we are. That's the way the regulatory system works. Q. You say you are limited in what you can charge. But you've just requested an average increase of 27 percent. That seems like a big jump. A. That rate increase is being sought and approved in stages. It doesn't mean that every homeowner gets a 27 percent increase. Homes in the most highly exposed areas will get the largest increases. Most importantly, we need to replenish the capital that was wiped out by last year's events -- all the profits we had made in Florida in home insurance since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Q. You've spoken of a need for a partnership between insurers and the government to deal with catastrophes. A. Allstate and other insurance companies simply cannot cover the losses from catastrophe after catastrophe and stay in business. The essence of insurance is covering occasional events of moderate damage that can be foreseen by actuaries, not these infrequent but very expensive events. For those kinds of events, federal or state government simply must play a role. Q. On terrorism, it looks like support is growing in Congress to extend the program under which the government pays most of the insurance costs in a major attack. A. Yes, I think support for that program is growing daily. But it doesn't provide for terrorism damage against homes and personal autos. And it should. Q. Perhaps that's because most experts think that the most likely targets are big commercial buildings, railways, bridges, tunnels, airplanes and airports. A. Well, the risks are very real. Think about a plant located in close proximity to a heavily populated area, a lot of houses. Terrorists could set off a bomb at that plant and damage a lot of homes. Saturday Interview"
"Hurricane Katrina churned through the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, increasing its strength and threatening the Florida Panhandle and neighboring states, after cutting a drenching swath through southern Florida and leaving seven dead. But just scattered patches of serious property damage were reported. The howling winds of the hurricane rose to more than 100 miles an hour in the gulf in the afternoon, and officials at the National Hurricane Center here said they could further intensify to as much as 150 miles an hour, making the storm a major juggernaut. ''It could be an extremely dangerous system,'' said Christopher Sisko, a meteorologist at the hurricane center, where other weather experts said it would most likely become a stronger, Category 4, storm. Hurricane Katrina crossed the beach near Hallandale in Broward County, north of here, early Thursday night as a relatively mild, wet and somewhat underestimated storm that just barely qualified for hurricane status, Category 1, with winds about 80 miles an hour. As anticipated, the storm did not deliver a knockout blow to Fort Lauderdale, Miami and other southern Florida cities. But many Floridians said that after a night of thrashing wind and driving rain, even a mild hurricane could be terrifying, hugely disruptive and surprisingly costly. Television coverage shot from helicopters showed acres and acres of virtually unscathed houses and businesses and mostly unharmed trees and shrubs. But south of downtown Miami, there was heavy flooding in Key Biscayne, Cutler Ridge, Goulds and Homestead, along with a few other residential areas west of Miami. About 1.2million people in southern Florida lost electricity. Water covered the streets in parts of Homestead and elsewhere, washed around cars and flowed knee deep through houses. But the houses seemed to be otherwise in good shape. Gov. Jeb Bush flew low over Homestead and said later, ''It didn't look like as much damage to property other than flooding.'' Throughout the region, trees were knocked down here and there. Power lines dangled into streets. Some roofs lost tiles. A houseboat sank at a dock in North Bay Village, a town on a cluster of islands in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach, and a few sloops broke loose from moorings and were thrown up on the shore of the bay. Government officials literally sighed with relief. ''We're very, very fortunate to have been spared as much as we were,'' George Burgess, the Miami-Dade County manager, said. ''While there has been flooding, it's isolated, and the damage is very minimal.'' Nonetheless, the storm brought Miami and other cities along 70 miles of the coast to a near standstill for much of Thursday and Friday. Insurance experts estimated that the cost of the scattered damage could run to $600million. That does not count the millions of dollars lost by hotels, restaurants, airlines and rental car agencies whose customers were scared off. Many other businesses also suffered. By Friday morning, operations resumed at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airports. A few cars made their way along main streets, some with lanes partly blocked by fallen trees and pools of water. But downtown Miami was all but deserted. By late afternoon, the huge cargo and cruise port remained closed. For many people like Mayor Carlos Alvarez of Miami-Dade County and ordinary residents, the story of Hurricane Katrina was a story of exceeded expectations. After an assessment by helicopter, Mr. Alvarez said although some sections looked ''like there wasn't a storm,'' the flooded areas to the south and west ''were hit harder than we expected.'' In Fort Lauderdale, just north of where the center of the storm came ashore, Amanda Sullivan, 21, said that the wind ripped her front door off its hinges and that she spent the night of the hurricane wondering whether she would survive. ''It was like something out of a movie,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ''There were metal pipes flying off the building, and a 20-foot trailer came flying through here. It was rocking and rolling, definitely a lot worse than we thought it would be.'' For Lannettee Stout, 43, a court reporter who lives in Hollywood, not far from where the hurricane made landfall, it was the unimagined noise. ''It was loud, extremely loud,'' Ms. Stout said. Three people who died in the hurricane were crushed by falling trees. One man lost control of his car and rammed into a tree. Three others drowned, including two who tried to ride out the storm in a houseboat. Forecasters said the hurricane could hit the Panhandle and nearby states late Sunday or early Monday. In southern Florida, the hurricane confounded forecasters who had expected it to move westerly in an almost straight line across the state at a snail's pace, 6 miles an hour. Instead, it sped up to 10 to 12 miles an hour and swung sharply on a diagonal to the southwest, reaching the gulf shortly after midnight. Had Hurricane Katrina, with its heavy rain, moved more slowly, weather officials said, the flooding could have been more severe. As the storm moved into the gulf, it initially headed west. State and federal weather officials said they expected a low pressure area over the Midwest to influence the direction of the storm, turning it north toward the Panhandle. Hurricane Dennis, the first storm of the year for Florida, hammered the Panhandle and sections of Alabama and Georgia in July, bringing less wind damage than expected, but widespread flooding. Forecasters said Hurricane Katrina might well hit the northern coast with more force than Hurricane Dennis. The state meteorologist, Ben Nelson, said Hurricane Katrina could push 20-foot walls of water over the beaches in surges almost twice as big as those of Hurricane Dennis. The Panhandle was hit hard last year by Hurricane Ivan. On Friday afternoon in southern Florida, Mr. Bush said he was concerned about the psychological effects from yet another hurricane. ''This wears you down,'' he said."
"New Orleans police officers yesterday shot and killed four people and wounded two others who had fired at officers escorting a convoy of contractors across a bridge, the authorities said. The group of 14 contractors from Boh Brothers Construction, one of New Orleans's largest construction companies, was working for the Army Corps of Engineers on levee repairs and drainage, said Robert Boh, the president of the company. The convoy, which included officials from the Army Corps of Engineers and was being escorted by a group of police officers on an anti-looting detail, was crossing the Danziger Bridge, 10 miles northeast of the French Quarter, when the shots were fired. W.J. Riley, the assistant superintendent of police in New Orleans, said a gunfight ensued between the police and a group of six men. ''All our officers said the assailants all had guns,'' Mr. Riley said. Later, he said all the assailants were ''neighborhood thugs.'' ''Five of the subjects were shot,'' he said. ''Two were killed, three were wounded.'' The sixth gunman was arrested and charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but none of the gunmen were identified. The superintendent said that as the shooting broke out, two of the men fled across the bridge and were pursued by officers. ''One officer saw one subject go into a building,'' he said. ''Another ran around the building. Shots were fired.'' Mr. Riley said one of the two was killed and the other was arrested. None of the contractors were hurt and they were even initially unaware that anyone had been shot, said Mr. Boh, learning of it only later in news reports on the Internet. STORM AND CRISIS: VIOLENCE"
"Dr. Jeffrey Orledge and his medical team provided care in New York City after the 2001 terrorist attacks and in Florida last year after Hurricane Ivan. None of that prepared them for the bedlam of the past week, he said on Sunday. Dispatched to Alabama from its home base in Augusta, Ga., on Aug. 28 in preparation for the hurricane, the team drove from place to place in Mississippi and Louisiana. Each time, it found it had nothing to do or could not provide assistance. Finally, early on Thursday, the team decided to go to the New Orleans International Airport, where it saw thousands of patients, some of them near death. The odyssey of Dr. Orledge demonstrates the difficulties federal officials confronted as they tried to cope with what may turn out to be the worst disaster in United States history. His team, the Georgia 4 Disaster Medical Assistance Team, was one of many ''assets'' that federal officials ''pre-positioned'' before the storm hit. But for Dr. Orledge, this early planning was squandered by poor coordination and communication and nonexistent security support. Dr. Orledge is an emergency room physician and an assistant professor at the Medical College of Georgia. His team includes two nurses and two paramedics. The team was told on Saturday, Aug. 27, that it would be deployed. The next day, it flew to Atlanta, rented a Chevrolet Suburban and drove to a Federal Emergency Management Agency facility in Anniston, Ala., where it sat out the storm. At midnight on Monday, federal officials told the team to go to Kenner, La., a small town near the airport, where it would help operate a triage center. ''We arrive. Utter chaos. And the triage center that we were supposed to support didn't exist,'' Dr. Orledge said. The team's local contact was Kenner's mayor, Dr. Orledge said. The mayor thought that Dr. Orledge was there to coordinate the money, supplies and other assistance that the mayor assumed federal officials would soon be sending, Dr. Orledge said. Dr. Orledge told the mayor that his team knew nothing of such things. Eventually, the mayor led the team to a school gymnasium where nearly 100 people had gathered. ''As soon as I started asking medical questions, we were surrounded,'' Dr. Orledge said. There was no security. Dr. Orledge felt that his team was not safe, and he insisted that they leave. They were escorted to a nearby hotel ''where we were immediately surrounded by about 100 drunk people,'' Dr. Orledge said. ''So I say, 'All right, we're not staying here,''' Dr. Orledge said. They got back into their cars and drove to city hall, where they spent the night. The next day, town officials directed the team to Kenner Regional Medical Center. ''The hospital's got no air conditioning, no water or sewer and very few medical supplies, and they've got 200 patients,'' Dr. Orledge said. Dr. Orledge said that his team could provide little assistance in such a case, so town officials directed them to a nearby nursing home. ''This time there were 250 patients, no air conditioning, no water, no sewer and a generator that was going to die in four hours,'' Dr. Orledge said. ''We couldn't do anything there either.'' The team's satellite and cellphones had not been working. Finally, though, they were able to reach federal emergency officials, who told them to go to Camp Shelby near Hattiesburg, Miss. The trip to Hattiesburg took nearly five hours over roads made nearly impassable by downed trees and power lines. ''Just as soon as we get there our phone rings and they tell us to turn around and go to Baton Rouge,'' Dr. Orledge said. Their vehicles were nearly out of gas. They flagged down a local police officer, who found them a supply. They drove back the way they came, passed Kenner and arrived in Baton Rouge, La., late Wednesday night. Federal emergency officials told the team that they were urgently needed to help support an urban search and rescue team, or USAR. They were given 30 minutes to prepare for departure. Their destination? City Hall in Kenner, La. ''We told them that we'd just been there and that there's nothing there, but they insist that there's a mission,'' Dr. Orledge said. The team got back into its vehicles and drove to Kenner's City Hall. ''I ask the mayor where the USAR team is, and he says, 'What's that?''' Dr. Orledge said. By then, people were openly looting in Kenner, Dr. Orledge said. Because of logistical difficulties, Kenner's mayor could not be reached on Sunday. On Wednesday, the team heard a rumor that some military units had occupied the New Orleans airport. They decided to drive to the airport and, when they arrived, slept in their vehicles. The next morning was Thursday. The Georgia team joined a triage operation to assess the health status of thousands. Donald R. Jacks, a federal emergency spokesman, estimated that more than 40,000 evacuees came through the airport on Friday and Saturday. The worst cases were brought in late Thursday and Friday when area hospitals were evacuated. Some patients arrived with full medical charts, Dr. Orledge said. Some were near death. Stretchers with very ill patients filled the airport's baggage claim area. Most were taken out in special planes. Dr. Orledge's team worked for more than 12 hours on Thursday, 18 hours on Friday and 14 hours on Saturday. By then, they had been asked to help relatively healthy evacuees just before they were boarded onto planes. Among the patients was Ronald Morgan, 51, of New Orleans. Mr. Morgan had a deep gash on his left wrist. He said he got it from punching out a window to escape the second floor of his house as the water rose to the roof. Theresa Cannon, 47, his wife, said they barely escaped in time. After he had been living on the street for nearly a week, Mr. Morgan's wound had begun to fester. Dr. Orledge dressed the wound, gave Mr. Morgan some antibiotics and told him to seek medical attention as soon as he arrived in San Antonio, where evacuees were told they were being flown. As he was giving instructions, Ms. Cannon said her foot had been bothering her. She took off her shoe, and she, too, had an infected wound, which she said she had gotten from a nail on the roof. Dr. Orledge prescribed a different antibiotic to ensure that they did not share pills. A few minutes later, Harold Veasey, 66, hobbled into the medical area. He removed his shoes. His feet were covered in sores, a result of walking in wet socks and shoes for five days. Dr. Orledge prescribed more antibiotics and told Mr. Veasey to sit for 30 minutes with his feet bare. But he soon suggested that Mr. Veasey board an airplane, his prescription for everyone he saw. He said that he hoped that better medical care -- as well as a better life -- awaited his patients elsewhere. STORM AND CRISIS: AID EFFORTS"
"THE brute force of a hurricane sparks a reflexive response: fight or flight, cherished pictures or heirloom china, beer or water? And news anchors, too, rely on well-worn instincts: go toward the disaster, set up shop and then stand out in the wind-driven rain to let the storm wreak havoc on their generally well-attended hair. Conditions, they will mostly tell you, are ''worsening.'' But that news vocabulary did not work well with Katrina. Television is great for cataclysms, but slow-motion disasters -- famine, civil war or a deadly drip of three more inches every hour -- do not supply the kind of dynamic images that make for easy annotation from a news desk in New York City. And for the first few days, it is clear that institutions fell down along with the levees. Neither the television networks nor the politicians they so slavishly cover seemed to have a clue until Thursday, very deep into the tragedy. But then the numbing tick-tock of cable news began to pay off. It wasn't the false weight of the anchors that transformed the coverage during the hurricane: Larry King's fussy ties and Sean Hannity's umbrage at civil unrest both looked silly. It was left to reporters embedded in the mayhem to let Americans know that a third world country had suddenly appeared on the Gulf Coast. In particular, CNN, the much-maligned, overrun cable news operation, and National Public Radio, the prissy, embattled bastion of the quiet left, both found their voices amidst the chaos. Conceived by Ted Turner as a maypole for news junkies, CNN did not overtake Fox News in the ratings, but it did experience a significant advance. From a rating of 0.5 before the hurricane, by Monday CNN had a 2.0 rating, just below Fox's 2.3. Holding down CNN's evening coverage, Aaron Brown's quizzical mix of gravitas and befuddlement finally landed on the right story. His on-camera fretting is freakish to behold in normal times, but these are not normal times. AT 11:20 on Monday night, when Katrina was blowing inland and his competitors at Fox and MSNBC were tying up their coverage with a bow -- the bullet was dodged, God's hand nudged it aside, the close call was just that -- Mr. Brown interviewed Jeanne Meserve, a veteran reporter for CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. After going out in a boat with rescuers, she said the water was deep and getting deeper, a prescient look into the week that was to come. ''We are sometimes wacky thrill seekers,'' she said to Mr. Brown. ''But when you stand in the dark, and you hear people yelling for help and no one can get to them, it's a totally different experience.'' The fact that she was weeping when she said this was both beside and exactly on point. Mr. Brown, in a suddenly appropriate imitation of a human being, acknowledged as much. ''Jeanne Meserve has been on the team for almost 15 years, I think,'' he said, looking into the camera. ''She is a very tough, capable, strong reporter, and she met her match on a story tonight.'' In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Brown said Ms. Meserve did her job and then some. ''No one who listened to that piece of reporting could come away thinking the story was over,'' he said. ''It was not just that things were bad. She clearly conveyed that they were getting worse.'' In a story where the line between perpetrator and victim is sliced razor thin, tempers are bound to fray. Anderson Cooper, CNN's bright young thing who had made fun of hurricane reporting in the past, found himself in the thick of it on Thursday and lashed back in what was supposed to be an interview with Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana. ''I've been seeing dead bodies in the streets here in Mississippi,'' he said. ''And to listen to politicians thanking each other and complimenting each other, you know, I got to tell you, there are a lot of people here who are very upset, and very angry, and very frustrated.'' Mr. Cooper's well-shaded outrage -- he stopped just this short of editorializing -- elicited the kind of anger that has been mostly missing from a toothless press. After a couple of years on the run from the government, public skepticism and self-inflicted wounds, the press corps felt its toes touch bottom in the Gulf Coast and came up big. Still, context, that grail of good coverage, remained ineffable. Katrina stuck at the end of the month, a time when poor people -- New Orleans is among the nation's most impoverished cities -- have little cash on hand. In every American city, the rich people live on the hill and the others live in the lowlands, where heat, water and pathogens collect. Not only did they not leave -- never mind that they had been worn down by media hyperbole in the past -- but now they were stealing! MSNBC, which is jointly owned by Microsoft and NBC, got a piece of exclusive video that showed people at a Wal-Mart in New Orleans looting at the pace of shoppers. Rita Crosby, a Fox alumnus who was recruited by MSNBC to add a bit of sizzle, made a spectacle of herself and her network by presuming to lecture Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, the governor of Louisiana, about the moral implication of desperate people stealing things they needed to live, or what they thought they might need. ''This is just terrible,'' she said. ''People taking advantage of those less fortunate, and in a time of disaster!'' It fell to Tony Zumbado, a veteran photojournalist, to tell viewers that a different, and far more material, narrative was under way. ''I can't put it into words the amount of destruction that is in this city and how these people are coping,'' he told Alison Stewart of MSNBC on Thursday night. ''They are just left behind. There is nothing offered to them. No water, no ice, no C-rations. Nothing, for the last four days.'' The narrative of feckless victims being plucked to safety wore thin over the week and anchors began posturing to no good effect. Mr. Hannity seemed riveted by the fact that rape was part of the story in the darkened corners of the convention center and Superdome. Reporters for Fox News, which is owned by the News Corporation, ignored him and went to work, with Shepard Smith and Stephen Harrigan breaking through with a message that politics aside, New Orleans was collapsing. NPR was among the first to let the public in on the nonplan for the emergency. After people who did exactly what the government told them to do found themselves without food, water, diapers, you name it, public radio reporters took their microphones into boats, onto rooftops and into the Superdome to let them say exactly what was happening to them. Listening, it turns out, fills a big silence at the center of so much media noise. The memes of mainstream coverage -- heroes and victims, right and left -- did not situate well over Katrina. It is easy to tut-tut from a distance, to suggest that this was bound to happen and everyone should have gotten out of Dodge, but that does not reflect the practical issues that people without cars or money confronted. On Thursday, after getting hold of my pal Brett Anderson, the restaurant critic at The New Orleans Times-Picayune, by e-mail, I was able to call him in Oxford, Miss., to talk about the mediated version of his city that the rest of the nation is staring at. ''It seems like the inverse of the 9/11 phenomena, where there was an unprecedented outpouring of support for New York, a city that people loved to hate,'' he said. ''Before this happened, New Orleans was a place that people truly loved. People reporting and watching the news ought to be careful thinking that they can define New Orleans based on the actions of a few people. Right now, Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, is debating whether New Orleans should be rebuilt.'' (Representative Hastert has since backed away from that suggestion, making him just one more person who will regret what he said and did when the going got tough.) ''Of course it should be rebuilt,'' my friend said. ''It should be rebuilt because it is an awesome city and because it is part of the United States.''

"Troops patrolled the streets, rescuers hunted for stragglers and New Orleans looked like a wrecked ghost town yesterday as the evacuation of the city neared completion and the authorities turned to the grim task of collecting bodies in a ghastly landscape awash in numberless corpses. In a city riven by violence for a week, there was yet another shootout yesterday. Contractors for the Army Corps of Engineers came under fire as they crossed a bridge to work on a levee, and police escorts shot back, killing three assailants outright and a fourth in a later gunfight, the police said, adding that a fifth suspect had been wounded and captured. There was no explanation for it, only the numbing facts. The larger picture of death was just as murky. No one could say how many had died in the hurricane or were waiting to be rescued after the city's levees burst. One morgue at the St. Gabriel Prison near New Orleans was expecting 1,000 to 2,000 bodies. Hundreds were missing in nearby Chalmette. In Baton Rouge, state officials said the official Louisiana death toll stood at 59, but most said that thousands was a more realistic figure. More than 125 were known dead in Mississippi. ''I think it's evident it's in the thousands,'' Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, told CNN on Sunday. Seven days after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the New Orleans known as America's vibrant capital of jazz and gala Mardi Gras celebrations was gone. In its place was a partly submerged city of abandoned homes and ruined businesses, of bodies in attics or floating in deserted streets, of misery that had driven most of its nearly 500,000 residents into a diaspora of biblical proportions. As the effects of the crisis spread across the nation, 20 states have opened their shelters, homes and schools to the refugees. But moving the population of New Orleans to other parts of the country has created overcrowding and strains. In Texas, where nearly half the refugees are jamming stadiums, civic centers and hotels, Gov. Rick Perry said the state's capacity was almost exhausted. Thousands of people were also arriving at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. In Baton Rouge, at two places, hundreds of people, many carrying umbrellas to protect them from the scorching heat, were lined up for hours waiting for emergency food stamps and other public assistance. There were no quick solutions. Making New Orleans habitable again was expected to take many months, even a year. Meanwhile, there were holdouts in the city, unknown numbers of people who refused to go. They were being urged to leave for their own safety. Officials warned of an impossible future in a destroyed city without food, water, power or other necessities, only the specter of cholera, typhoid or mosquitoes carrying malaria or the West Nile virus. As helicopter and boat crews searched flooded neighborhoods for survivors yesterday and officials focused for the first time on finding, collecting and counting the dead, Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, warned that Americans must brace for some gruesome sights in the days ahead. ''We need to prepare the country for what's coming,'' Mr. Chertoff said on the ''Fox News Sunday'' television program. ''We are going to uncover people who died hiding in the houses, maybe got caught in the floods. It is going to be as ugly a scene as you can imagine.'' Stung by critics who say its sluggish response compounded the suffering and cost lives, the Bush administration rolled out a public relations offensive yesterday. Mr. Chertoff visited the Sunday television talk shows to give status reports and defend the government's response. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld went to the stricken states yesterday to assess the damage and pledge relief, and President Bush planned another visit to Louisiana and Mississippi today. He flew over the area on Wednesday as he returned to Washington from a vacation at his Texas ranch, and made an inspection tour on Friday. The administration's problems in the crisis seemed to crystallize in a dramatic appearance on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' by Aaron Broussard, president of Jefferson Parish near New Orleans. Sobbing, he told of an emergency management official receiving phone calls from his mother, who, trapped in a nursing home, pleaded day after day for rescue. Assured by federal officials, the man promised her repeatedly that help was on the way. ''Every day she called him and said, ''Are you coming, son? Is somebody coming?''' Mr. Broussard said. ''And he said, 'Yeah, Mama, somebody's coming to get you.' Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday. Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday. Somebody's coming to get you on Thursday. Somebody's coming to get you on Friday. And she drowned Friday night. She drowned Friday night.'' Mr. Broussard angrily denounced the country's leadership. ''We have been abandoned by our own country,'' he said. ''It's not just Katrina that caused all these deaths in New Orleans here. Bureaucracy has committed murder here in the greater New Orleans area, and bureaucracy has to stand trial before Congress now.'' Congress, returning from a summer recess, is widely expected to undertake investigations into the causes of and reaction to the crisis, and even some Republicans warned that the government's response, widely viewed as slow and ineffectual, could further undermine Mr. Bush's authority at a time when he is lagging in the polls, endangering his Congressional agenda. In New Orleans, thousands of National Guard and active duty troops as well as federal marshals finally appeared to be in control of streets where looters and hooligans had run wild for days last week, unchecked by overwhelmed police officers who were focused on saving lives, not property, in the chaotic city. Fires had burned unchecked by overwhelmed firefighters. The crisis put enormous pressure on many police officers and firefighters, pressure some could not withstand. P. Edwin Compass III, the New Orleans police superintendent, said on Saturday that 200 of the 1,500 members of his force had walked off the job and that two others had committed suicide. He said yesterday that the city had offered to send all members of the police and fire departments and their families on vacations to Las Vegas. ''When you go through something this devastating and traumatic, you've got to do something dramatic to jump-start the healing process,'' Mr. Compass said. The notion of a vacation in the midst of disaster struck some as unusual. But officials likened it to an R&R break for combat troops. Military reinforcements, who arrived in the thousands over the weekend, will take over the search and rescue work temporarily, though New Orleans officials said they would remain in charge. ''We haven't turned over control of the city,'' said Col. Terry Ebbert, director of homeland security for New Orleans. ''We're going to leave a skeleton force -- about 20 percent of the department -- for leadership and liaison with the troops while we get some rest.'' During the buildup of troops in recent days, federal, state and local officials have given often wildly disparate figures for military personnel on the ground or on the way. Mr. Bush on Saturday said there were more than 21,000 National Guard troops in Louisiana and Mississippi and 4,000 active duty forces to assist them. He ordered 7,000 more troops into New Orleans. Colonel Ebbert put the number in the city at 1,000. Yesterday, Brig. Gen. Michael P. Fleming of the National Guard in Baton Rouge said there were 16,000 guardsmen in Louisiana. The deployment of the troops, whatever their numbers, the arrival of tons of food and other supplies, and progress in closing the breached levees added to a sense of momentum in the stricken city over the weekend. So did stepped-up evacuation efforts. The Louisiana Superdome and the New Orleans convention center, which had become fetid and dangerous refuges for as many as 50,000, were virtually emptied. Hotels, hospitals and other shelters were also evacuated. Though the number of the dead was still unknown, a few details could be gleaned about the tragedy. Officials said nine bodies came from the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, where emergency workers had set up a triage unit. Of a group of 11 bodies from the Superdome, officials said, many were ailing patients on ventilators. New Orleans remained a city in crisis. There was still no power except that provided by generators, almost nowhere to buy food or water, no reliable transportation or communications systems, no effective firefighting forces. There were thousands of people awaiting flights out at the airport. Officials said 3,000 to 5,000 people had been treated at the unit, and that only 200 remained. The airport director, Roy Williams, said 30 people had died, some of them elderly. Other problems developed. Even as the city population dwindled, hundreds of new arrivals were reported to be entering from outlying towns, stragglers who had been unable to escape from their hometowns in the past week and who believed their surest way out could be found with the buses, trains and planes evacuating New Orleans. There was no way to tell how many New Orleans residents remained in the city. Many were believed hiding in homes or apartments. Rescue teams in helicopters searched flooded neighborhoods and went out in boats and on foot to press a house-to-house search for holdouts yesterday. One helicopter crashed, but no one was injured. Many residents were found and evacuated, but what Mr. Chertoff called a significant number refused to go. ''That is not a reasonable alternative,'' he said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''We are not going to be able to have people sitting in houses in the city of New Orleans for weeks and months while we de-water and clean the city.'' People like Frank Asevado III, a 37-year-old mechanic, and Travis Latapie, 44, a shrimp fisherman, both from St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans, complained bitterly in interviews of being abandoned by the government after the waters engulfed their community. They told of using their boats for several days to save 300 friends and neighbors, plucking them from floodwaters and the roofs of homes and cars. ''We never see no Coast Guard, no nothing,'' Mr. Latapie said. Mr. Asevado added, ''The government didn't do jack.'' Aid from around the country continued to move toward the stricken region. New York City, which dispatched 100 city buses and 172 police officers to New Orleans on Saturday, decided yesterday to send 150 more officers and 300 firefighters today. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg noted that Louisiana had been among the many states that helped New York after Sept. 11. ''We understand that we have an obligation, and we're happy to do it,'' the mayor said. In the midst of misery in New Orleans, there were lingering signs of a fading vivacity. About two dozen people gathered in the French Quarter for an annual Labor Day gay celebration, the Decadence Parade. Matt Menold, 23, a street musician wearing a sombrero and a guitar, explained: ''It's New Orleans, man. We're going to celebrate.'' But the tragedy of New Orleans was more vividly represented in the Garden District, a business area dotted with antique shops. At the corner of Jackson Avenue and Magazine Street, a woman's body had been on the sidewalk since Wednesday. People had covered her with blankets and plastic, and by yesterday a small wall of bricks had been erected around the corpse to hold down a tarpaulin to cloak her. On it, someone had spray-painted a cross and an epitaph: ''Here lies Vera. God help us.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"Each day since Katrina brings more evidence of the lethal ineptitude of federal officials. I'm not letting state and local officials off the hook, but federal officials had access to resources that could have made all the difference, but were never mobilized. Here's one of many examples: The Chicago Tribune reports that the U.S.S. Bataan, equipped with six operating rooms, hundreds of hospital beds and the ability to produce 100,000 gallons of fresh water a day, has been sitting off the Gulf Coast since last Monday -- without patients. Experts say that the first 72 hours after a natural disaster are the crucial window during which prompt action can save many lives. Yet action after Katrina was anything but prompt. Newsweek reports that a ''strange paralysis'' set in among Bush administration officials, who debated lines of authority while thousands died. What caused that paralysis? President Bush certainly failed his test. After 9/11, all the country really needed from him was a speech. This time it needed action -- and he didn't deliver. But the federal government's lethal ineptitude wasn't just a consequence of Mr. Bush's personal inadequacy; it was a consequence of ideological hostility to the very idea of using government to serve the public good. For 25 years the right has been denigrating the public sector, telling us that government is always the problem, not the solution. Why should we be surprised that when we needed a government solution, it wasn't forthcoming? Does anyone remember the fight over federalizing airport security? Even after 9/11, the administration and conservative members of Congress tried to keep airport security in the hands of private companies. They were more worried about adding federal employees than about closing a deadly hole in national security. Of course, the attempt to keep airport security private wasn't just about philosophy; it was also an attempt to protect private interests. But that's not really a contradiction. Ideological cynicism about government easily morphs into a readiness to treat government spending as a way to reward your friends. After all, if you don't believe government can do any good, why not? Which brings us to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In my last column, I asked whether the Bush administration had destroyed FEMA's effectiveness. Now we know the answer. Several recent news analyses on FEMA's sorry state have attributed the agency's decline to its inclusion in the Department of Homeland Security, whose prime concern is terrorism, not natural disasters. But that supposed change in focus misses a crucial part of the story. For one thing, the undermining of FEMA began as soon as President Bush took office. Instead of choosing a professional with expertise in responses to disaster to head the agency, Mr. Bush appointed Joseph Allbaugh, a close political confidant. Mr. Allbaugh quickly began trying to scale back some of FEMA's preparedness programs. You might have expected the administration to reconsider its hostility to emergency preparedness after 9/11 -- after all, emergency management is as important in the aftermath of a terrorist attack as it is following a natural disaster. As many people have noticed, the failed response to Katrina shows that we are less ready to cope with a terrorist attack today than we were four years ago. But the downgrading of FEMA continued, with the appointment of Michael Brown as Mr. Allbaugh's successor. Mr. Brown had no obvious qualifications, other than having been Mr. Allbaugh's college roommate. But Mr. Brown was made deputy director of FEMA; The Boston Herald reports that he was forced out of his previous job, overseeing horse shows. And when Mr. Allbaugh left, Mr. Brown became the agency's director. The raw cronyism of that appointment showed the contempt the administration felt for the agency; one can only imagine the effects on staff morale. That contempt, as I've said, reflects a general hostility to the role of government as a force for good. And Americans living along the Gulf Coast have now reaped the consequences of that hostility. The administration has always tried to treat 9/11 purely as a lesson about good versus evil. But disasters must be coped with, even if they aren't caused by evildoers. Now we have another deadly lesson in why we need an effective government, and why dedicated public servants deserve our respect. Will we listen? Op-Ed Columnist E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com Correction: October 2, 2005, Sunday Op-Ed columns by Paul Krugman (Sept. 5 and 9), Maureen Dowd (Sept. 10) and Frank Rich (Sept. 18) said Michael Brown, the former FEMA director, was a college friend or college roommate of Joe Allbaugh, his predecessor. They went to different colleges and later became friends."
"The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina became a rallying cry for African-American religious and political leaders here in President Bush's former hometown on Sunday, with pleas for charity mixed with a seething anger at the response to the crisis. Many blacks voiced suspicions that thousands of people were left to suffer and die in the floodwaters because they were, for the most part, poor and black. ''Are you telling me we can coordinate a relief effort on the other side of the world and we can't do it here?'' I.V. Hilliard, pastor of the New Light Christian Center Church in northern Houston, thundered from the pulpit of his megachurch on Sunday morning. ''I'm not saying they didn't care. I'm saying they didn't care enough!'' ''I can't help but think that race has something to do with it,'' he added to a chorus of amens. Mr. Hilliard's church is the largest predominantly black congregation in Houston, with 20,000 members, four locations and a broadcast ministry. Mr. Hilliard's comments were echoed throughout the country over the weekend, as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Representative Maxine Waters of California made a trip to the convention center in New Orleans and the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People met with the governor of Louisiana and visited the emergency operations center in Baton Rouge. Interviews with African-American church leaders, local politicians and residents here made clear the damage that the faltering relief effort has had on their perceptions of the Bush administration. Mr. Bush and his chief political advisers have mounted an effort to try to court more conservative black voters, particularly since the 2004 election, by encouraging black Republican candidacies and reaching out to black churches. But their outreach efforts appear to have been significantly set back. Criticism of the response is coming not only from black members of Congress and national civil rights leaders, but also from prominent local officials and ordinary residents here. ''There is a lot of anger here in Texas,'' said the Rev. William A. Lawson, retired pastor of the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston. ''Even a lot of conservative whites are angry. This was not the reaction people expect to a disaster of this magnitude. We wanted to see them get off their butts and get over there.'' Rodney Ellis, an African-American Democratic state senator who represents a district in Houston, said he was trying to focus on the needs of the evacuees, thousands of whom are in Houston. Mr. Ellis said that the initial federal response was clearly inadequate and that many in the administration bore responsibility, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is black and from Alabama. ''This problem is so mammoth it's not going to go away any time soon,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''There will be ample time for Condi Rice and others in the federal government to redeem themselves. And I'm hoping they do that.'' Administration officials have tried over the last two days to repair the damage. Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, met with civil rights leaders and members of the Congressional Black Caucus at the White House on Saturday to discuss aid efforts and accusations of racial indifference. Mr. Bush held a live news conference in Washington on Saturday to announce that he was sending additional troops to the Gulf Coast and to defend the government's response to the storm. The size of the disaster area, he said, ''has created tremendous problems that have strained state and local capabilities.'' ''The result is that many of our citizens simply are not getting the help they need, especially in New Orleans,'' he said. ''And that is unacceptable.'' Ms. Rice visited the Gulf Coast on Sunday, flying to Mobile, Ala., to attend a church service and meet with storm victims. On the plane trip from Washington, Ms. Rice challenged accusations that the government had responded slowly because many of the victims were black. ''How can that be the case?'' Ms. Rice said, according to The Associated Press. ''Americans don't want to see Americans suffer.'' She added, ''Nobody, especially the president, would have left people unattended on the basis of race.'' Later, at Pilgrim Rest A.M.E. Zion Church in Whistler, Ala., the Rev. Malone Smith Jr. invited Ms. Rice to say a few words. ''The Lord Jesus Christ is going to come on time,'' she said, ''if we just wait.'' Outside the squalid convention center in New Orleans yesterday, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Waters, a California Democrat, offered bitter criticism of those who, they said, had failed them. ''This looks like the hull of a slave ship,'' Mr. Jackson said as he reviewed the packed sidewalk where families had gathered, their belongings in torn trash bags. Ms. Waters said she had traveled throughout Africa and never seen anything quite like that scene. ''This looks like an undeveloped country,'' she said. ''No time did I think in America we would see this kind of homelessness, this kind of displacement. This is the worst thing I have ever seen.'' In Baton Rouge, Bruce S. Gordon, president of the N.A.A.C.P., said federal aid for victims should be commensurate to what was given to those who lost relatives in the Sept. 11 attacks, adding that ''the benchmark for recovery should be 9/11.'' ''Ask yourself,'' Mr. Gordon said, ''have we put the investments, have we put the assets, have we put the resources that we put into 9/11?'' There was also abundant criticism of the news media over the weekend. The Rev. Al Sharpton, after visiting the encampment of displaced Louisianans in the Houston Astrodome on Saturday, objected to the use of the word ''refugees'' for the people who fled the hurricane. ''These are not refugees,'' he said. ''They are citizens of Louisiana and Mississippi, tax-paying citizens. They are not refugees wandering somewhere looking for charity. They are victims of neglect and a situation they should have never been put in in the first place.'' Many also took the news media to task for seeming to single out black people as looters in lawless New Orleans last week. Kanye West, the rap star, dropped his prepared script at a televised benefit for storm victims on Friday night to say: ''I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says they're looting. See a white family, it says they're looking for food.'' Mr. West also said, ''George Bush doesn't care about black people.'' Ronald Joubert, 41, a member of the New Light congregation in Houston, was a bit more charitable to the president, though not much. ''The people are saying that that's why the people in New Orleans didn't get a more direct response, because they're all black,'' Mr. Joubert said. ''Me, I don't blame Bush personally. I blame the whole government. But 10 or 15 or 20 years from now, people are still going to be blaming Bush.'' STORM AND CRISIS: RACIAL TENSION"
"Jim Amoss, the editor of The Times-Picayune, faced an ugly decision on Tuesday morning. About 240 employees and some members of their families, including one 6-month-old baby, had spent the night in the corridors of the newspaper building at 3800 Howard Avenue in New Orleans, just over a mile northwest of the Superdome. They seemed to have survived the hurricane: the building was still standing, though a full sheet of glass from one window had been blown out of its casing, slicing through the general manager's office. Outside, however, the parking lot was submerged and water was rising up the steps to the entrance. And there were reports of a jail break nearby. As the water crept up another riser, he made his decision. ''We needed to leave while the leaving was possible,'' he said. What followed was an odyssey for Times-Picayune workers as they looked for a new home outside New Orleans while managing to publish their paper -- initially online and eventually in print. The paper, which normally has a circulation of 270,000, had to report the biggest story in its history with no electricity, no phone access and no place to work. With its readers scattered across the South, the paper turned its affiliated Web site, www.nola.com, into a release valve for the accumulating tales of misery from the city, providing news, crucial information and a missing persons forum that now contains more than 17,000 posts. The pilgrimage has already joined the lore of The Times-Picayune, which has served New Orleans since 1837 and whose history includes the writers William Faulkner and William Sidney Porter, better known by his pen name, O. Henry. Other newspapers in the hurricane zone also struggled to publish. The Mississippi Press, in Pascagoula, took refuge in The Mobile Register's offices in Alabama, and used its presses. The Sun Herald, in Gulfport, Miss., managed to print a paper each day last week with the help of The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer in Georgia. But The Times-Picayune became an example of a private business in New Orleans that was able to function, even thrive, through the disaster. At the same time, employees there were coping with the loss of their homes and relocation of their families, just like their neighbors. And they struggled with their own deepest fears: for five days, the wife and son of a photo technician were missing (they were found on Saturday at a shelter in Houma, La., where they had been airlifted from their neighborhood). But one reporter, Leslie Williams, remains missing. ''We vacillate between utter despair at what's happened to our city and our lives and exhilaration at what we're doing and how our readers are responding to it,'' Mr. Amoss said. Last Monday, after the initial blow of Katrina, the idea of evacuation was not being considered, Mr. Amoss said. The electricity was out, but the newspaper had a generator to keep some computers running in the photo studio, which was the most interior, and therefore safest, part of the building. Staff members and their families who had chosen to stay at the building overnight, some with their spouses, had planned to hunker down and wait out the storm. But by Monday evening, as Katrina was moving on, their sense of safety was eroding. James O'Byrne, the features editor, and Doug MacCash, the art critic, ventured out on bicycles to inspect the Lakeview neighborhood where Mr. O'Byrne lived. Already, houses were nearly submerged in more than eight feet of water. ''I know for a fact my house is gone,'' Mr. O'Byrne said. At 10 p.m. Monday, as other news outlets were reporting that the city had escaped destruction, Mark Schleifstein, the paper's environmental reporter, confirmed that a breach had opened in the levee near the 17th Street canal. The article was headlined: ''Lakeview Levee Breach Threatens to Inundate City.'' That paper was never printed. A power outage shut down the paper's presses, which are housed in the same building, so it was published only on the paper's Web site. By midmorning on Tuesday, ''you couldn't walk out the building without walking in water up to your waist at this point,'' said Peter Kovacs, the managing editor for news operations. As the water rose, Mr. Amoss and the publisher, Ashton Phelps Jr., devised a plan to leave from the loading docks, using the newspaper's delivery trucks. ''Editors were barking orders through the newsroom and cafeteria, where some were still eating breakfast, to grab what you could put on your lap and move to the loading dock,'' Mr. Amoss said. About six laptops were carried out. Mr. Kovacs snapped up his toothbrush, a college T-shirt and a cigar. At 9:40 a.m., the newspaper's Web site displayed this post, clearly punched out in haste: ''The Times-Picayune is evacuating it's New Orleans building. Water continues to rise around our building, as it is throughout the region. We want to evaucate our employees and families while we are still able to safely leave our building.'' As the trucks were pulling out, Alex Brandon, a photographer, returned to the building with a computer storage card full of photographs. He trudged and swam through the water, handing over the card, said Doug Parker, the photography editor, then returned to work. ''He's still on the streets of New Orleans, hasn't had a shower since Monday,'' Mr. Parker said. The water sloshed against the grilles of the delivery trucks, some packed with as many as 25 staff members, as they moved slowly along roads leading to the Pontchartrain Expressway. From the back of the trucks, the evacuees could see toppled trees, downed power lines and residents pushing shopping carts and walking along the upper edges of the roads. The trucks headed for the paper's West Bank bureau, about eight miles south of the Howard Avenue building and a few miles past the city line. There, the editors decided some employees would need to return to the city to continue reporting and taking pictures, and they asked for volunteers. Seven reporters and two photographers climbed into a truck to go back. In total, the newspaper has had about 15 reporters and photographers in New Orleans since the storm hit. ''I'm thinking if there had been another 15 to 30 minutes, our butts would still be in there,'' Mr. Kovacs said. The evacuated employees were sent to two locations. By midafternoon Tuesday, many had arrived in Houma, La., where The Courier was offering food, computers, phone lines and, although spotty, Internet connections. Employees' families were dropped off at nearby shelters. The Courier, which is owned by The New York Times Company, had just finished work on its afternoon issue. About 12 journalists, led by Dan Shea, a managing editor, stayed in Houma that night, posting news on the Web site and trying to put together an issue of the paper in portable document format, or pdf, which allows for a traditional newspaper layout. The team had none of their production software and templates, and no access to any of The Times-Picayune's fonts, and was struggling with rolling blackouts. Still, Mary Chauvin, a copy editor, was able to replicate the look of the paper on the fly by cobbling together graphic elements from earlier online editions.. About 60 more Times-Picayune staff members went on to Baton Rouge, La. There, the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University had offered banks of phones and computers. The paper that appeared the next morning, again in pdf format on the Web site, contained 17 articles and an editorial, all written by staff members, and 12 photographs, only one of which came from The Associated Press. Photographs taken from the air showed a city washed out; emergency crews climbing on a roof for a rescue, only to find a dead man; refugees in boats; burning buildings; a pile of floating rubble that included a half-submerged car. A detailed article about the breach near the 17th Street canal by Mr. Schleifstein was headlined: ''Flooding Will Only Get Worse.'' By Wednesday, reporters were sending articles to their editors from New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Houston and several spots along the coast, some by whatever landline they could find, often from the homes of friends or relatives. Sometimes, they resorted to powering their laptops using car batteries. Nola.com became what Mr. Phelps, the Times-Picayune's publisher, called a lifeline, with more than 72 million page views by people around the world, from Sunday to Thursday last week. Mr. Amoss said page views surpassed 30 million on Friday. Before the hurricane, the site received about six million page views a week. The most frightening experience was still to come for one reporter, Gordon Russell, reporting from New Orleans. Last Thursday, when the streets seemed ripe for riots to break out, he and a photographer drove from the Convention Center into the aftermath of what looked like a shootout. A bloodied body lay on the ground and police officers had their weapons up. The photographer, Marko Georgiev, a freelancer for The New York Times, said that as he slowed his car to take a photo, the police trained their weapons on the car. Ordered from the car, the two men were pushed face-first against the car and nearby walls with hands up. Police officers threw their notebooks and camera equipment to the ground and ordered them to leave. Mr. Russell, quoted by his colleagues on the Nola.com Web site later that day, said: ''I'm scared. I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm getting out of here.'' The headline above the report said ''City Not Safe for Anyone.'' Meanwhile, staff members, straining to report the disaster, were realizing the extent of the damage to their own homes. More than 30 percent of the newspaper staff members had lost their homes, one employee estimated. Jon Donley, the editor of Nola.com, worked for two days without hearing from his adult daughter before learning she was safe. ''He worked posting all that on the Internet, not knowing whether his daughter was alive or not,'' Mr. O'Byrne said. Joe Graham, a photo technician, had still not heard from his wife and son by Friday afternoon. Their house was in eastern New Orleans, an area that had some of the worst flooding. On Saturday afternoon, Terry Baquet, the Page 1 editor, was almost giddy as he reported that Mr. Graham's family had been found safe. At the Washington bureau for the Newhouse newspaper chain, which publishes The Times-Picayune and 25 other newspapers, colleagues said they felt out of touch. ''We were only able to reach editors intermittently,'' said Bill Walsh, The Times-Picayune's Washington reporter. ''Some we didn't even know where they were or whether they were all right.'' By the weekend, many on the staff were realizing what they had accomplished, although their exuberance was tempered by the tremendous losses endured by the city and the unresolved disappearance of their colleague, Mr. Williams, who had been sent to the Mississippi coast last Monday to cover the storm. ''I'm trying not to let a depressing thought get into my head,'' Mr. Kovacs said. Mr. Williams is an experienced reporter who was born in the area and has covered many hurricanes. ''It weighs on me; it weighs on all of us,'' said Mr. Amoss. Meanwhile, editors were trying to beat back a rumor that the paper would be shut down. On Thursday, Mr. Phelps called the rumor ''ridiculous'' in a statement. ''The Times-Picayune will continue to publish. Period,'' he wrote. And indeed, by Friday morning, The Times-Picayune had managed to resume its print editions again. It printed 50,000 copies at The Courier --a ''seat of the pants'' press run, Mr. Amoss said, its size a guess of how much of an audience the paper would have. The paper was distributed, using the same delivery trucks that had ferried the staff to safety, to subscribers throughout Louisiana and to the habitable areas of New Orleans. And it was also delivered in bulk to shelters, where it was given away. There's no telling when, or if, The Times-Picayune can bring its circulation back to the 270,000 that it had a little over a week ago. No one knows the condition of its presses, or how the Howard Avenue building has fared. The Courier will continue to be its printing plant for the time being. But Mr. Amoss also took heart in the news that readers were pouncing on the paper ''like hungry wolves'' as soon as it was delivered, and the print run was being increased to 60,000 for today's issue . HURRICANE KATRINA: THE NEWSPAPER"
"AS the Gulf Coast reels from Katrina's devastation, online businesses are struggling to gauge the impact of the possible loss of half a million prospective customers for weeks or months. ''This is a tough one, because it is a big market,'' said Patti Freeman Evans, an analyst with Jupiter Research, an Internet consulting firm. ''You can't get goods in there, and people aren't in their homes anyway, so there's not much companies can do.'' According to comScore Networks, an Internet research and consulting firm, 860,000 people, on average, surfed the Web from their homes or offices in New Orleans and the Mississippi towns of Biloxi and Gulfport each day in the week preceding the storm. People who fled the Gulf Coast will no doubt find Internet access in their temporary homes, but few are likely to look on the Web for the necessities of life. Online travel agencies like Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz are no doubt feeling the pinch more than most online retailers. Not only must they cope with a deluge of calls from customers who had booked trips to the Gulf Coast and now want their money back, they must also face up to the possibility of a slump in sales as some vacationers and business executives deterred from flying to New Orleans drop their travel plans altogether. ''It's the 19th-most-popular destination for Labor Day,'' said Joel Frey, a Travelocity spokesman. ''And there really isn't anything comparable to the city to offer as an alternative.'' With Mardi Gras just six months away and recovery estimates for the city still cloudy, agencies cannot even be sure that one of the prime travel events of February will occur. Even if the city is in a position to stage Mardi Gras events, travel companies cannot say how many travelers New Orleans will be able to accommodate. None of the top online travel agencies would discuss the economic impact of the storm in detail. ''Our main concern is just dealing with the group of travelers who've made plans to travel to the area,'' said Mr. Frey, the Travelocity spokesman. ''But there will be long-term implications that every travel agency will have to address.'' Among other actions it has taken, he said, Travelocity this week sent e-mail messages to 14,000 customers who had booked flights, hotel rooms and car rentals in the afflicted areas. The company has also waived the cancellation and rescheduling fees it typically charges customers, as have most airlines and other travel companies. Calls to Travelocity's help centers, meanwhile, have surged since the storm took aim at New Orleans, with customers often waiting 20 to 30 minutes before reaching a company representative. So far, Internet investors have not reacted negatively to the storm's aftermath. Expedia's shares, for instance, have hovered in the $22 range since the hurricane hit. Aaron Kessler, an Internet analyst with Piper Jaffray, an investment firm, said the online travel companies would probably issue public estimates of the damage to their businesses ''over the next couple of weeks.'' ''There will be some impact, but it's nothing any of these companies can't absorb,'' Mr. Kessler added. Investors who were concerned about the slowed growth in the domestic online travel market, he said, had already sold their shares in recent months. General merchandise retailers on the Web say they have not experienced significant dropoffs in sales, at least yet. EBay, for instance, notes that it has 157 million customers worldwide. ''Trading is pretty diversified, so we don't expect a noticeable impact,'' said Chris Donlay, an eBay spokesman. The Web's biggest online retailer, Amazon.com, is holding an undisclosed number of packages for customers in the affected areas. An Amazon spokeswoman, Patricia Smith, declined to discuss the financial impact of the hurricane on the company. Scott Silverman, executive director of the industry group Shop.org, said retailers were ''most concerned now with shipping work-arounds, and trying to figure out how to communicate with customers in affected areas. Fortunately, the Gulf Coast doesn't have as high a concentration of distribution centers as places like Tennessee or Ohio, so it isn't having a major impact on distribution.'' While bigger retailers appear diversified enough to avoid significant sales losses as a result of the hurricane, other more specialized merchants may not be as fortunate. ''We'll take a hit for sure,'' said John Rogers, director of e-commerce for Orvis, a Manchester, Vt., retailer of fishing supplies and apparel. ''Not only for the people in that area, but from the country as a whole. Since people are focused on something so serious, they're not thinking about shopping.'' Mr. Rogers said that Orvis had many customers in the hard-hit area and that call center volume was down 10 percent from typical levels. ''Probably 80 percent of that is folks who were impacted by the storm,'' he said. ''We're hoping it's a short-term bump, but it's just too early to say.'' Like many retailers, Orvis relies on catalogs to generate phone and Internet orders. But the 50,000 catalogs the company had ready to mail to the New Orleans area this week will gather dust for months or perhaps head to the shredder. Still, just as many industries have benefited from rebuilding efforts after natural disasters, analysts said, online merchants could witness a boom when the Gulf Coast cities begin rebuilding. Ms. Evans of Jupiter Research pointed out that many traditional retailers may not have their stores fully ready when citizens return to the city, and that electronic stores could help fill the need. ''These people have lost everything -- kitchen stuff, furniture, clothes, books, school supplies,'' Ms. Evans said. ''When the insurers start paying out, we'll really see the demand happen.'' E-COMMERCE REPORT"
"''Bush to New Orleans: Drop Dead'' Neither the death of the chief justice nor the frantic efforts of panicked White House political advisers can conceal the magnitude of the president's failure of leadership last week. The catastrophe in New Orleans billowed up like the howling winds of hell and was carried live and in color on television screens across the U.S. and around the world. The Big Easy had turned into the Big Hurt, and the colossal failure of George W. Bush to intervene powerfully and immediately to rescue tens of thousands of American citizens who were suffering horribly and dying in agony was there for all the world to see. Hospitals with deathly ill patients were left without power, with ventilators that didn't work, with floodwaters rising on the lower floors and with corpses rotting in the corridors and stairwells. People unable to breathe on their own, or with cancer or heart disease or kidney failure, slipped into comas and sank into their final sleep in front of helpless doctors and relatives. These were Americans in desperate trouble. The president didn't seem to notice. Death and the stink of decay were all over the city. Corpses were propped up in wheelchairs and on lawn furniture, or left to decompose on sunbaked sidewalks. Some floated by in water fouled by human feces. Degenerates roamed the city, shooting at rescue workers, beating and robbing distraught residents and tourists, raping women and girls. The president of the richest, most powerful country in the history of the world didn't seem to notice. Viewers could watch diabetics go into insulin shock on national television, and you could see babies with the pale, vacant look of hunger that we're more used to seeing in dispatches from the third world. You could see their mothers, dirty and hungry themselves, weeping. Old, critically ill people were left to soil themselves and in some cases die like stray animals on the floor of an airport triage center. For days the president of the United States didn't seem to notice. He would have noticed if the majority of these stricken folks had been white and prosperous. But they weren't. Most were black and poor, and thus, to the George W. Bush administration, still invisible. After days of withering criticism from white and black Americans, from conservatives as well as liberals, from Republicans and Democrats, the president finally felt compelled to act, however feebly. (The chorus of criticism from nearly all quarters demanding that the president do something tells me that the nation as a whole is so much better than this administration.) Mr. Bush flew south on Friday and proved (as if more proof were needed) that he didn't get it. Instead of urgently focusing on the people who were stranded, hungry, sick and dying, he engaged in small talk, reminiscing at one point about the days when he used to party in New Orleans, and mentioning that Trent Lott had lost one of his houses but that it would be replaced with ''a fantastic house -- and I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch.'' Mr. Bush's performance last week will rank as one of the worst ever by a president during a dire national emergency. What we witnessed, as clearly as the overwhelming agony of the city of New Orleans, was the dangerous incompetence and the staggering indifference to human suffering of the president and his administration. And it is this incompetence and indifference to suffering (yes, the carnage continues to mount in Iraq) that makes it so hard to be optimistic about the prospects for the United States over the next few years. At a time when effective, innovative leadership is desperately needed to cope with matters of war and peace, terrorism and domestic security, the economic imperatives of globalization and the rising competition for oil, the United States is being led by a man who seems oblivious to the reality of his awesome responsibilities. Like a boy being prepped for a second crack at a failed exam, Mr. Bush has been meeting with his handlers to see what steps can be taken to minimize the political fallout from this latest demonstration of his ineptitude. But this is not about politics. It's about competence. And when the president is so obviously clueless about matters so obviously important, it means that the rest of us, like the people left stranded in New Orleans, are in deep, deep trouble.

"As the service started at Mount Zion First Baptist Church, the choir, 30 members strong in flowing green robes, broke into a gospel song that rocked the walls and had parishioners on their feet, swaying and waving their arms in the air. At that moment, a gray-haired man in a black-and-white plaid shirt, tan cargo shorts and black running shoes bounded out of his pew, trying to stifle sobs, and headed outside. ''I tried to hold it back, but I couldn't do it,'' said Richard Duskin, four days past his 71st birthday, as he sat in his car. ''That's not me crying like this. I don't know what happened. I just got full when they started singing, and I couldn't stop it. I didn't want to go to church looking like this, but everyone said we ought to go. You lose everything you have, well, I guess that does things to you. But others have it worse. I'm glad I'm still alive.'' A few minutes later, Mr. Duskin, his home underwater in east New Orleans, composed himself and went back inside the historic black church, which displays the slogan: ''The Church Where the Neighborhood Becomes a Brotherhood.'' In the storm-ravaged towns of the Gulf Coast, and in hundreds of nearby ones overflowing with evacuees, Sunday was a day for many people for the first time since the storm hit to try to channel unfathomably complex emotions, to stop, to pause, to pray. So with countless mixtures of pain and fear, hope and faith, weakness and strength, many across the South, for a day, got to do what comes naturally. They went to church. Many went to the battered remains of buildings, gathering with what was left of the usual congregations. But -- like Mr. Duskin, his wife, Gayle, their daughter, son-in-law and four grandchildren; Ronald Givens; Consuelo Culbreath; Fatai and Barbara Ebagua; Edward and James Feist; and other evacuees from the New Orleans area who found their way to Mount Zion today -- many just went where they could. They came to old black churches like this one downtown, where the congregation usually dresses with elegant formality, many women immaculate in their white dresses and matching hats, and to mall-like suburban megachurches already contemplating megarelief efforts. There were ministers who came to hold services for those at the huge relief effort at the River Center convention center and others who pulled up there in vans to take people to services in other parts of town. No religious institution faced as daunting a challenge as the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Most of its parishioners have scattered, and half of its 300 priests are unaccounted for. But Archbishop Alfred C. Hughes of New Orleans, the spiritual leader of 500,000 people in one of the most heavily Roman Catholic regions in the United States, said he was preparing to put together his archdiocese ''in exile.'' ''I never thought the Lord was going to ask me to take this on at 72,'' he said after celebrating an emotional Mass here at the Cathedral of St. Joseph, the seat of the Diocese of Baton Rouge. Sunday was perhaps the first time since 1725 that Mass has not been said in a parish church in New Orleans, said Archbishop Hughes, adding that a few priests who stayed behind in the stricken city may have offered communion to individual Catholics around them. The task, as Archbishop Hughes described it, is to reorganize the Archdiocese of New Orleans, including an extensive charitable network and 104 parochial schools, in Baton Rouge. The chaos surrounding Hurricane Katrina may have already claimed the life of one of his priests, the Rev. Thomas Kinney, who had cancer and died at St. Clare's Nursing Home in Baton Rouge on Saturday night, just after he evacuated from New Orleans. Two priests who stayed to minister to refugees in the Superdome are missing. Archbishop Hughes has not heard from a third priest, who went to the Louis Armstrong airport in New Orleans to tend to elderly, frail and disabled residents who were being airlifted for medical treatment. Archbishop Hughes is trying to send priests in pursuit of what he described as a diaspora that has emptied half of the parishioners of the eight civil parishes in Louisiana that his archdiocese covers. Priests have been sent to Atlanta, Dallas and Houston and the Louisiana cities of Alexandria and Lafayette to minister to evacuees from New Orleans. Archbishop Hughes himself fled New Orleans, driving alone in a Ford Taurus, on Aug. 28, the day before Hurricane Katrina struck. He said he did so only at the urging of public officials who said he would set an example for residents of New Orleans and would be better able to coordinate the archdiocese's response from a safe location. Asked whether he still had hope, he declared: ''Absolutely. Absolutely. That is the root of our faith. ''The most important thing is to not doubt God's presence and God's saving and transforming grace,'' he continued. ''I'm convinced that God is going to purify us through this.'' At Mount Zion, the disaster on the Gulf Coast was both text and subtext for much of the service, as it was, almost inevitably, for churches around the region and the nation. Indeed, the pastor, the Rev. Anthony Kelley, began the service by citing the storm, welcoming the visitors uprooted by it and noting the church's plan to create a seven-pronged response to it. Also on the pulpit was the Rev. Edward J. Feist, associate minister of the First African Baptist Church of New Orleans, who proclaimed: ''We know there are some this morning that are still on the rooftops. There are some, oh God, that are still in attics. But we know with your outstretched hand, Lord, you can keep them safe.'' Then Mr. Kelley's sermon, like a hurricane itself, rumbled and rolled over a landscape of wind and water, death and redemption. He began by reading from Matthew 14:22-33, in which Jesus walks on the water and calms the seas for those who believe in him. ''Jesus said: 'Be not afraid. I won't forsake you. I will be with you in your storm,''' Mr. Kelley hollered, the congregation yelling in assent. God, he said, already had a plan. People might not know it. They might not see it. But it's there. Jesus, after all, was killed on a Friday and resurrected on a Sunday, the ultimate reminder that hope conquers despair. ''I'm here to tell you that Sunday is on the way. Help is on the way. Deliverance is on the way,'' Mr. Kelley said, the organ wailing, the people yelling, the joy and hope as palpable as the hot air outside. By the end, it was Mrs. Duskin, who teaches English at Dillard University, who was in tears, overwhelmed by emotion, she said, but fortified by the message of hope. ''It was something that I needed to hear,'' she said, ''that God's looking out for us. That even though we can't see what's ahead, that he's looking out for us.'' After the service there was a lunch of ham, green beans and potato salad in the church gymnasium, and, for a moment at least, Mr. and Mrs. Duskin could be seen at their table, with family, with friends, all smiles. STORM AND CRISIS: CHURCHES"
"Under the command of President Bush's two senior political advisers, the White House rolled out a plan this weekend to contain the political damage from the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. It orchestrated visits by cabinet members to the region, leading up to an extraordinary return visit by Mr. Bush planned for Monday, directed administration officials not to respond to attacks from Democrats on the relief efforts, and sought to move the blame for the slow response to Louisiana state officials, according to Republicans familiar with the White House plan. The effort is being directed by Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, and his communications director, Dan Bartlett. It began late last week after Congressional Republicans called White House officials to register alarm about what they saw as a feeble response by Mr. Bush to the hurricane, according to Republican Congressional aides. As a result, Americans watching television coverage of the disaster this weekend began to see, amid the destruction and suffering, some of the most prominent members of the administration -- Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense; and Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state -- touring storm-damaged communities. Mr. Bush is to return to Louisiana and Mississippi on Monday; his first visit, on Friday, left some Republicans cringing, in part because the president had little contact with residents left homeless. Republicans said the administration's effort to stanch the damage had been helped by the fact that convoys of troops and supplies had begun to arrive by the time the administration officials turned up. All of those developments were covered closely on television. In many ways, the unfolding public relations campaign reflects the style Mr. Rove has brought to the political campaigns he has run for Mr. Bush. For example, administration officials who went on television on Sunday were instructed to avoid getting drawn into exchanges about the problems of the past week, and to turn the discussion to what the government is doing now. ''We will have time to go back and do an after-action report, but the time right now is to look at what the enormous tasks ahead are,'' Michael Chertoff, the secretary of Homeland Security, said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. One Republican with knowledge of the effort said that Mr. Rove had told administration officials not to respond to Democratic attacks on Mr. Bush's handling of the hurricane in the belief that the president was in a weak moment and that the administration should not appear to be seen now as being blatantly political. As with others in the party, this Republican would discuss the deliberations only on condition of anonymity because of keen White House sensitivity about how the administration and its strategy would be perceived. In a reflection of what has long been a hallmark of Mr. Rove's tough political style, the administration is also working to shift the blame away from the White House and toward officials of New Orleans and Louisiana who, as it happens, are Democrats. ''The way that emergency operations act under the law is the responsibility and the power, the authority, to order an evacuation rests with state and local officials,'' Mr. Chertoff said in his television interview. ''The federal government comes in and supports those officials.'' That line of argument was echoed throughout the day, in harsher language, by Republicans reflecting the White House line. In interviews, these Republicans said that the normally nimble White House political operation had fallen short in part because the president and his aides were scattered outside Washington on vacation, leaving no one obviously in charge at a time of great disruption. Mr. Rove and Mr. Bush were in Texas, while Vice President Dick Cheney was at his Wyoming ranch. Mr. Bush's communications director, Nicolle Devenish, was married this weekend in Greece, and a number of Mr. Bush's political advisers -- including Ken Mehlman, the Republican National Committee chairman -- attended the wedding. Ms. Rice did not return to Washington until Thursday, after she was spotted at a Broadway show and shopping for shoes, an image that Republicans said buttressed the notion of a White House unconcerned with tragedy. These officials said that Mr. Bush and his political aides rapidly changed course in what they acknowledged was a belated realization of the situation's political ramifications. As is common when this White House confronts a serious problem, management was quickly taken over by Mr. Rove and a group of associates including Mr. Bartlett. Neither man responded to requests for comment. White House advisers said that Mr. Bush expressed alarm after his return to Washington from the Gulf Coast. One senior White House official said that Mr. Bush appeared at a senior staff meeting in the Situation Room on Friday and called the results on the ground ''unacceptable.'' At the encouragement of Mr. Bartlett, officials said, he repeated the comment later in the Rose Garden, the start of this campaign. STORM AND CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT"
"One of the earliest and perhaps clearest alarms about Hurricane Katrina's potential threat to New Orleans was sounded not by the Weather Channel or a government agency but by a self-described weather nerd sitting on a couch in Indiana with a laptop computer and a remote control. ''At the risk of being alarmist, we could be 3-4 days away from an unprecedented cataclysm that could kill as many as 100,000 people in New Orleans,'' Brendan Loy, who is 23 and has no formal meteorological training, wrote on Aug. 26 in his blog, irishtrojan.com. ''If I were in New Orleans, I would seriously consider getting the hell out of Dodge right now, just in case.'' Mr. Loy's posting that Friday afternoon came three days before the hurricane struck and two days before the mayor of New Orleans, Ray C. Nagin, issued an evacuation order. Posts over the next several days, in aggregate, seem now like an eerie rewriting of the tale of Chicken Little, in which the sky does in fact fall. In the cooperative and competitive world of blogs, Mr. Loy's has gotten some serious praise. Mickey Kaus, whose kausfiles blog is featured on Slate.com, wrote on Friday that ''Loy's blog for the past week is a pretty extraordinary document,'' adding that ''it should maybe be in the Smithsonian, if you can put a blog in the Smithsonian.'' Glenn Reynolds, who blogs at instapundit.com, linked to Mr. Loy's Web site several times beginning on Aug. 26. That's the Internet equivalent of a northeaster, and all over, blogs started linking to Mr. Loy's. (Jeff Masters and Charles Fenwick, among others, also gave early and dire warnings about New Orleans on their highly trafficked weather blogs.) According to Blog Pulse from Intelliseek, which measures blog links, Mr. Loy's was the most frequently cited nonnews source among hurricane-related blogs. On Aug. 28, it was ranked 14th among most frequently linked-to sites of all sorts. That was more weight than Mr. Loy, who weighs 160 and is 6 foot 2, is accustomed to throwing around. A second-year law student at Notre Dame, he began blogging in 2002 -- writing about football (his blog's name combines Notre Dame's football team, the Fighting Irish, with that of his college team, the Trojans of the University of Southern California), his cats, his dog Becky, his fiancé, the Red Sox, politics, ''The Lord of the Rings'' and weather. ''Hurricane Hugo was the first storm that I paid attention to, when I was 7 or 8,'' he said in a telephone interview from South Bend, Ind. ''I found them fascinating and became kind of a weather nerd, watching the Weather Channel religiously.'' Mr. Loy joined online discussions with other hurricane watchers, and monitored the National Hurricane Center's Web site, whose satellite pictures he regularly posts and analyzes on his blog. He called for Mayor Nagin to issue an evacuation order days before the mayor issued one, and his posts on the subject grew increasingly agitated. ''It's definitely true that I am more willing to pull the trigger,'' he acknowledged, ''because I don't have to deal with the consequences if they had had an evacuation and the storm hadn't hit. It's easy for me to sit here and say, 'Everyone leave.''' He derives little pleasure from being proved right. ''The results are so dire, and I knew they would be so dire, that I was fervently praying that I'd be wrong. There's always some vindication that comes from being right, but I would much rather have been wrong and be getting 1,000 hits a day now instead of 25,000.'' Classes started last week, and Mr. Loy has put an end to all-night blogging. Recent entries have been as likely to be about his cats or football as Katrina. He will keep chasing hurricane information, but he says that if a hurricane approached him, he would heed his own advice. ''As much as I'm enthralled by high waves and strong winds,'' he said, ''I understand the powers of these things. I might leave the computer running and have a Webcam hooked up and hope the power didn't go out so I could see what was happening from a remote location, but I wouldn't stick around.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE WEB LOG Correction: September 6, 2005, Tuesday An article in Business Day yesterday about Brendon Loy, the Notre Dame student who was one of the earliest to sound the alarm about the potential threat to New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina, misstated the name of Mr. Loy's dog.

"The boat pulled up to the living room window on Read Boulevard early Sunday afternoon, and a volunteer rescuer, Stanley Patrick, began yelling: ''Mr. Robert! Mr. Robert! Can you hear me?'' There was no sound in response, only the lapping of water in this reeking New Orleans East neighborhood, where the rooftops of cars were still covered nearly a week after a levee broke and the city was inundated. Mr. Patrick grabbed a sledgehammer, broke through the window of the tidy brick house and sloshed down a hallway into a back bedroom. It seemed unlikely that he would encounter anyone alive in this toxic water, in this fetid heat. He found what he expected to find, an 83-year-old man, floating face down in stagnant water that had risen three and a half feet into the home. A Louisiana state trooper asked that the man not be identified in full because his family had not yet been notified. Rescuers were told there might be a woman in the house, too. ''I didn't see her, but if he's dead, she's dead,'' Mr. Patrick said. ''If he didn't leave, she didn't leave.'' As rescue operations went on, the frustrations of the police and volunteers continued to mount Sunday, as a growing number of those who had stayed in their homes seemed to be dead, and many of those who remained alive refused to leave. But Col. Terry Ebbert, director of the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security, said Sunday that he expected that nearly everyone would be removed from the city by Tuesday, as rescuers made block-by-block searches. He said he thought there were fewer than 1,000 residents left in the city. ''We're going to remove them,'' he said. ''People don't want to come out,'' said Capt. Tim Bayard, commander of the narcotics division of the New Orleans Police Department, who is supervising the water rescue effort. ''They say they have enough water and food to sustain themselves. They don't understand. It's going to take six to eight weeks before the electricity comes on.'' The water has receded only about a foot in many places, he said, adding that it was still 20 feet deep in spots. ''They need to come out,'' Captain Bayard said. But some residents fear that if they leave, their houses will be ransacked by looters, he said. ''They've already lost their cars,'' he said. ''All they have left is their house. They don't want those animals stealing from them. Write that, animals. Anybody that would take advantage of this is hardly better than animals. Not the people who are taking food and water and clothing. Those stealing TV's and shooting at police. What can you do with a TV? There's no electricity.'' Police have said that early rescue efforts were hampered when they encountered gunfire. It was also difficult to get enough of boats in the water because of bureaucratic foul-ups, Captain Bayard said. One day, as many as 300 boats were in the water, he said, but he could have used 1,000. ''There was a breakdown in communication and coordination, and some people wanting to be lone stars and not cooperate,'' he said, declining to lay blame but saying federal officials were not at fault. ''We have the boats now. Unfortunately, people don't want to utilize them.'' More than 10,000 people have been evacuated by boat, Captain Bayard said. Captain Bayard said he was reluctant to force anyone to leave against their will. If a boat capsized in a struggle, police officers and evacuees could drown or be subjected to disease, he said. But if ordered to remove residents, he would do so, he said. A volunteer rescuer, Morgan Lopez, said he and colleagues had all but forced four people from a home at Dwyer and Bundy Roads on Sunday, where a sea of raw sewage had reached the steps of the house. A woman, an 8-year-old child and the child's grandparents finally agreed to leave, Mr. Lopez said. ''We acted like we were cops,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''We were not letting them stay in that stuff. They had a lot of new clothes. Maybe they were trying to protect that.'' Mr. Lopez was one of about 40 workers from R&R Construction in Lake Charles, La., who volunteered their time in boats usually used for bass fishing. Two other R&R workers, Mr. Patrick and Scott Lovett, were dispatched to Read Boulevard to look for what they thought was an older couple. A shotgun rested in the boat next to Mr. Lovett, who said shots had been fired near him on occasion during the past week. ''I don't feel like I'm in the U.S.,'' Mr. Lovett, 22, said. ''I feel like I'm in a war. All the guns, the chaos.'' Mr. Patrick, 44, an ironworker, said he had also rescued victims after Hurricane Andrew hit Louisiana in 1992. The man on Read Boulevard may have tried to get into his attic and cut his way through the roof, but was perhaps too feeble or retreated in heat that would have topped 100 degrees, Mr. Patrick theorized, noting a ladder that led to the attic. The house appeared to be on a slight incline, and perhaps the man thought he was safe, Mr. Patrick said. ''It's tragic,'' Mr. Patrick said. ''The water rose in one night. These people probably didn't know. There's a lot more dead right here. I can smell it.'' He predicted that the death toll would be ''astronomical.'' In coming days, the boat searches will shift from primarily a rescue mission to a recovery mission, once a sufficient morgue can be established, Captain Bayard said. Still, he said, the police, volunteers and the army would continue to look for survivors, and military trucks would patrol the streets in case those who had insisted to remain changed their minds -- perhaps, he said, once they ran out of food or could no longer stand the smell of decay. ''It's frustrating because they don't want to help themselves,'' Captain Bayard said. ''But if they are going to come out, we're going to be there to pick them up. We're not going to turn our backs on them.'' STORM AND CRISIS: RESCUE EFFORTS"
"When even Fox News will not give Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld more than half the screen for his first appearance in the Hurricane Katrina disaster zone, it is clear that television is having a major mood swing. The last time reporters and anchors were so personally and passionately involved in a story was early in the Iraq war, when journalists who accompanied troops for weeks at a time became bullish supporters of the soldiers and their mission. Hurricane Katrina has had a similar but opposite effect: after spending time with the storm refugees in the Superdome and the convention center in New Orleans, normally poised, placid TV reporters now openly deplore the government's failure to help the victims adequately. And their outrage, illustrated with hauntingly edited montages of weeping mothers, sickly children and dead bodies rotting on the street, traveled up the news division chain of command, from camera operators to anchors and across the spectrum from CNN to Fox. By the weekend, television news programs had more hopeful images of daring helicopter rescues, airport triage, convoys of troops deployed across the flood waters and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praying in church in her native Alabama, yet recrimination still rang out. Even the announcement that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had died did not divert television cameras from the destruction -- or the government bungling. (MSNBC has an on-screen count of the time elapsed since Katrina hit -- ''6 days/5 hours'' -- that is reminiscent of the ''Day 110'' coverage of the Iranian hostage crisis that began in 1979.) It's the kind of combative coverage that Richard M. Nixon faced during Watergate, that Bill Clinton faced during his impeachment trial and that most presidents have endured sometime in their tenures. But ever since the Sept. 11 attacks, this president had been spared the harshest questioning -- even with troops bogged down in Iraq, his White House news conferences have been so tame they are parodied by ''Saturday Night Live'' and Jon Stewart. On ''Meet the Press'' yesterday, Tim Russert lacerated Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, demanding to know, among other things, ''How the president could be so wrong, be so misinformed?'' Fox News, normally highly deferential to the Bush administration, was gentler but just as skeptical. Chris Wallace, the host of ''Fox News Sunday,'' asked Mr. Chertoff, ''Mr. Secretary, how is it possible that you could not have known on late Thursday, for instance, that there were thousands of people in the convention center who didn't have food, who didn't have water, who didn't have security, when that was being reported on national television?'' The Bush administration, normally so deft at staying a step ahead of the television cameras, spent the weekend trying to catch up. President Bush, who plans to make a second trip to the Gulf Coast today -- a disaster mulligan -- paid a quick visit to the Red Cross headquarters in Washington to thank the volunteers and publicly display his concern. Mr. Rumsfeld and Ms. Rice visited the region to make the same point, but their news conferences were clouded by an outburst by Aaron F. Broussard, president of Jefferson Parish, who wept as he described, on ''Meet the Press,'' the drowning of a friend's mother who was left stranded in the St. Bernard nursing home for four days. ''Nobody's coming to get us. The secretary has promised. Everybody's promised,'' Mr. Broussard said. ''They've had press conferences. I'm sick of the press conferences. For God sakes, shut up and send us somebody.'' Mr. Broussard's meltdown was shown on NBC, MSNBC and also CNN, which has been one of the most aggressive in covering the disaster and assigning blame. The switch mirrors public outrage, but it is buoyed by a rare sense of righteous indignation by a news media that is usually on the defensive. Viewers could see that as late as Thursday, television news crews could travel freely back and forth from the convention center, but water trucks, ambulances and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency could not. Some reporters helped stranded victims because no police officers or rescue workers were around. (Fox's Geraldo Rivera did his rivals one better: yesterday, he nudged an Air Force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety.) News reports alerted the world, and, it seems, an inattentive federal government, to the neglected victims in New Orleans. And television networks even acted as benefactors, holding star-studded telethons to raise money for the storm's victims. STORM AND CRISIS: NEWS COVERAGE -- THE TV WATCH Editors' Note: September 27, 2005, Tuesday The TV Watch column on Sept. 5 discussed broadcast journalists' undisguised outrage at the failings of Hurricane Katrina rescue efforts. It said reporters had helped stranded victims because no police officers or rescue workers were around, and added, ''Fox's Geraldo Rivera did his rivals one better: yesterday, he nudged an Air Force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety.'' The editors understood the ''nudge'' comment as the television critic's figurative reference to Mr. Rivera's flamboyant intervention. Mr. Rivera complained, but after reviewing a tape of his broadcast, The Times declined to publish a correction. Numerous readers, however -- now including Byron Calame, the newspaper's public editor, who also scrutinized the tape -- read the comment as a factual assertion. The Times acknowledges that no nudge was visible on the broadcast."
"A day after two police suicides and the abrupt resignations or desertions of up to 200 police officers, defiant city officials on Sunday began offering five-day vacations -- and even trips to Las Vegas -- to the police, firefighters and city emergency workers and their families. The idea of paid vacations was raised by both Mayor C. Ray Nagin and senior police officials who said that their forces were exhausted and traumatized and that the arrival of the National Guard had made way for the officers to be relieved. ''I'm very concerned about individuals who have been here, particularly since the first few days, and have been through a lot of hardship,'' Mr. Nagin said in an interview. He said most of the police officers, firefighters and emergency medical workers ''are starting to show signs of very, very serious stress, and this is a way to give them time to reunite with their families.'' Mr. Nagin, who has been demanding more federal assistance for days as his city struggled with despair, death and flooding, said he had asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay for the trips but the agency said it could not. He said the city, therefore, would pay the costs. He said he believed there were now enough National Guard members in the city to allow the police to take a break and still keep the city secure, and he brushed off questions about whether such a trip might look like a dereliction of duty. ''I'll take the heat on that,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''We want to cater to them.'' His words were seconded by the police superintendent, P. Edwin Compass III, in a separate interview. ''When you go through something this devastating and traumatic,'' Mr. Compass said, ''you've got to do something dramatic to jump-start the healing process.'' The officials were planning to send 1,500 workers out in two shifts for five days each. They are sending them to Las Vegas because of the availability of hotel rooms and to Atlanta because many of them had relatives there. They said that they were trying to get the first officers on their way on Monday and that the first stop would be Baton Rouge, about 75 miles from here. There the officers will be given physical examinations and inoculations against possible infection from the polluted floodwaters, said Col. Terry Ebbert, the director of homeland security for the city, who has authority over the police and fire departments and other emergency services. Then, Colonel Ebbert and other officials said, those who want to go to Las Vegas or Atlanta will be given air transportation and a hotel room. The city is reserving hotel rooms in Baton Rouge, they said, adding that the officers and firefighters may also be given the choice of flying to other cities. Colonel Ebbert, the senior official running the recovery and rescue operation, and Mr. Compass both said that they planned to take a break as well, but probably for less than five days, and that they would continue to direct the recovery by telephone. Officials said they expected the military, with much greater resources, to expand rescue work, begin cleaning up the city and take the first steps toward reconstruction. W.J. Riley, the deputy superintendent of police, said that by late Sunday afternoon more than 2,900 National Guard members and law enforcement officers from around the country were operating in New Orleans. By early evening, Mr. Riley said, the advance units of a 2,200-person force from the 82nd Airborne Division had landed. Several thousand more soldiers were expected, including members of the First Cavalry Division. Reinforcements are also expected for the fire department. Senior firefighters, who have been forced to ignore some fires and to try merely to keep the worst blazes from spreading, said that several hundred firefighters with fire engines and radio equipment were heading for New Orleans from departments around the country. New Orleans officials said they would remain in charge. Mr. Riley, who has been on the police force for 24 years, will oversee the police department in the superintendent's absence. ''We haven't turned over control of the city,'' Colonel Ebbert said. Mr. Riley said that 40 percent of the city's force of about 1,200 officers would remain at their posts while the others were on leave. When the first group returns, Mr. Riley said, those who stayed behind will get a break. Deputy Fire Chief Joseph Matthews, who is also the director of the city's Office of Emergency Preparedness, said officials viewed the time off for their security forces as essential. ''We've been at this six days and we need to give our people a break,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE POLICE Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"Hurricane Katrina destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, threw at least a million people out of work, disrupted supply lines for businesses and brought misery to untold numbers. Will it also put an end to the housing boom? There are good reasons to think so: the storm has led to rising oil prices and shortages of building materials, and is likely to shake consumer confidence. But most experts think the housing market's five-year run still has a way to go before it peters out. In a weird twist of fate, the storm could even extend the housing boom, which in recent weeks had seemed to be running out of steam. That is certainly true in places like Houston, Atlanta and Baton Rouge, La., which are experiencing a surge in rental and homebuying activity as a result of the storm and the exodus that followed. As refugees from New Orleans poured into Baton Rouge last week, along with workers who expect to help with the rebuilding effort along the Gulf Coast, the local housing market, which up until now has plodded along at a stable pace, suddenly experienced the kind of frenzy that has been associated with New York, Miami or Silicon Valley in the last few years. ''I've never seen anything like this before,'' said Robert Cook, a real estate agent with Re/Max Elite in Denham Springs, La., a suburb of Baton Rouge. ''It's sort of scary.'' Mr. Cook said he represented five buyers in two days last week who made offers on homes, and fielded hundreds of calls and e-mail messages from others. On Friday, he said, he was with a couple from Picayune, La., who made offers on several houses only to discover they had already been sold. In addition to refugees and workers, he said, ''investors are coming in from out of state by the droves and trying to buy stuff.'' Housing markets well outside the immediate path of the refugees may also experience effects from the hurricane. Last week, mortgage rates, which had been creeping up in recent weeks, fell by about a quarter of a percentage point. Some economists said the rates had responded to indications that the Federal Reserve may now raise interest rates less aggressively because of concerns that rising oil prices will weaken the broader economy. Ellen Bitton, who owns Park Avenue Mortgage Group, a mortgage lender and broker in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., said she expected buyers to rush this week to take advantage of the lower rates. ''Whether or not this is going to be a blip in the market, nobody knows,'' she said. ''It's almost an unexpected window of opportunity for people who want to lock into a better rate.'' But some economists said the lowered mortgage rates were unlikely to offset other factors that pointed to a cooling housing market before Katrina hit. ''I don't want to get too carried away by a 25-basis point move,'' said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, referring to the drop in rates (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percent). With inventories of available houses and condos rising in the markets ''where a lot of the effervescence was concentrated,'' he said, as well as declining mortgage applications, ''that is telling me that the housing boom is basically over.'' Rising oil prices could put a crimp in the housing market if they prompt companies to slow hiring, or, perhaps more crucially, set off a psychological resistance to homebuying. On a practical level, higher prices at the pump may give some buyers pause about driving long distances to look at houses. Doug Fenichel, spokesman for K. Hovnanian Homes, a home builder in Edison, N.J., said the company was concerned about ''how willing is someone to jump into a car to take a drive for a couple of hours just to go look at a house.'' The company, which has several new developments in central New Jersey, has been drawing buyers from all over the state. Now it is considering offering incentives to people who will ''take a ride from northern New Jersey to central New Jersey to see a home.'' The hurricane is also likely to drive up the cost of new construction. Last week, home builders were closely watching prices and supplies of building materials like cement, plywood and roof tiles. The ports in New Orleans and Mobile, Ala., which were closed last week, brought in about 12 percent of all cement imports, said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders. Plywood prices spiked by about 20 percent last week, a result of disrupted production in the hurricane-ravaged region, said Jon P. Anderson, publisher of the industry newsletter Random Lengths. Builders were also wondering whether the cost of asphalt roof tiles, as well as other petroleum-based materials like plastic piping and asphalt for driveways, would rise because of increases in the price of oil. Some contractors and builders were stockpiling. ''We're already getting calls from users in the United States who are afraid that supplies will get sucked into the hurricane zone, leaving them in a vacuum,'' said Murray Abramovitch, the vice president of marketing for Emco Building Products, a roofing materials maker in Montreal. ''People are starting to say: 'We'd better protect ourselves and secure supply.''' The immediate priority is evacuating the people still stranded in New Orleans, but at some point the attention will turn to reconstruction. When that happens, home builders in other parts of the country say they may face material and labor shortages. The scale of the rebuilding is likely to be larger than that of any other disaster in the United States because the losses are so much greater. After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, about 28,000 housing units were destroyed, Mr. Carliner said. According to estimates from the American Red Cross, about the same number were ruined by the four hurricanes that struck Florida last year. In New Orleans, as many as 100,000 homes could be damaged beyond repair. As a result, ''you're going to see a lot of building materials and an inordinate amount of labor go there,'' said Joel Lazar, corporate vice president of sales and marketing for Transeastern Homes, a Florida home builder. With construction labor already scarce, Mr. Lazar said, the rebuilding effort in the Gulf region will ''take a challenging situation that already exists in Florida and make it more challenging.'' If history is any guide, prices for construction materials will jump when reconstruction begins in the Gulf. The price of plywood increased by about 45 percent after Hurricane Andrew, said Mr. Carliner. Some developers might have to postpone projects as the rebuilding picks up steam. ''It will slow down some projects in early 2006 because of competition in the Gulf region for rebuilding,'' said Hessam Nadji, managing director of research services at Marcus and Millichap, a real estate investment brokerage company based in Encino, Calif. While the comeback of New Orleans could come at the expense of building in other regions, it will also provide a tremendous amount of work to architects, builders, contractors and construction workers for years to come. Although he was horrified by the wreckage in his home state and its neighbor, Bobby Rayburn, owner of a home builder in Jackson, Miss., also saw another side. The rebuilding effort ''will be a big stimulus,'' he said. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE HOUSING MARKET"
"One after another, the westward-bound buses pull off Interstate 10 and all but collapse at the Texas Travel Information Center here. Their doors sigh open to release the fetid smell of a devastated New Orleans: of urine and waste and mud; of days spent on rooftops, on bridge overpasses, in dark and dangerous concrete behemoths. If despair carried an odor, it would be this. The future for the dazed evacuees inside is so uncertain that they do not even know where their buses are headed, other than to a shelter somewhere, maybe Beaumont, maybe Dallas. So many have streamed into this state, more than 220,000, that Gov. Rick Perry -- who delivered an Emma Lazarus-like vow last week to take in the huddled masses of Hurricane Katrina -- now says the state's shelters are near capacity. Still, the manifestation of the governor's offer continues here at this state-line tourist center, which the Red Cross and local volunteers have transformed into an off-ramp haven, where food is dispensed, hugs are shared and harrowing words are released into the muggy Texas air. The ground here is dry, and firm. The tourist center, with its massive Lone Star sculpture that is set aglow at night, is the first stop in Texas for those leaving, or fleeing, Louisiana. Among the many destinations it promotes is this small city, population 19,000. Visit the Orleck, a destroyer built here in 1945. Stop at the old-fashioned Farmers' Mercantile general store. Don't forget the International Gumbo Cook-Off, always the first weekend in May. All that has been set aside for a more immediate form of hospitality. Forty-one lavatories line the ''Pet Rest Area.'' Boxes of donated clothes and a humming Emergency Medical Services truck take up several parking spots. Volunteers from the Red Cross and local churches stand ready to hand out snacks, fruit and drinks -- often the first food that many evacuees have had in nearly a week. Then the word goes out again: ''Here comes another one.'' A bus door opens, and New Orleans stumbles out, gasping, weeping. Thursday blurred into Friday, and now Friday had become Saturday night. Scenes that could have been lifted from ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' or maybe the Book of Exodus, continued to play out in a tourist-center theater, amid air permeated by bus exhaust. Over here, a mud-spattered 1996 Ford pickup, fresh from New Orleans some 240 miles away, with three men in the cab and three on the flatbed, alongside plastic bags of salvaged belongings. They were headed for Houston because one had a distant relation there. After that, who knows, said the driver, Alvaro Fuentes, as he ate free chips. Over there, sprawled across the front seat of a foul-smelling Buick station wagon, Bobby Glover, 71, diabetic, and crying. He had spent several days on a roof in Waveland, Miss. ''Just beat him if he doesn't straighten up,'' joked his wife, Sarah, to lighten the heavy moment. Out of yet another bus stepped a young woman who could not stop sobbing. Her two small boys, charged with late-night, pent-up exuberance, tugged at her arms, while her husband conveyed no sign of comprehension. They had just been told they were bound for a shelter in a place called Deweyville. ''It's awesome out there,'' Rose Thayer, a volunteer from the First Presbyterian Church, assured them. ''It's a nice place. And the kids are going to do wonderful in the school.'' As the woman wandered off, no doubt trying to conjure a place called Deweyville, Ms. Thayer and other volunteers said that the story was one of too many that they have heard at the tourist center in recent nights. ''We were the first food, the first clothing, the first everything,'' she said. The first to see the dehydrated babies, who were immediately given Pedialyte. The first to hear about the children and grandparents who were put on earlier buses, and now were somewhere unknown in this Lone Star State. The first to be shown photographs of what evacuees said were dogs tugging at corpses. These stories and images will linger in Orange long after the buses have gone, long after the hundreds of evacuees have left the shelters in its churches and the pastors can take down the hand-scrawled signs about curfews and computers set aside for ''help locating loved ones.'' It was nearly midnight when another bus pulled into the tourist center. The driver, Greg Bruce, a volunteer from Tallahassee, Fla., accepted a cup of orange soda and explained the odyssey of his day. Mr. Bruce said that he drove the streets of New Orleans before being directed by soldiers to a bridge where hundreds of people had spent days without help. The people filed on board, 57 in all, filling his bus with that smell. They rode in silence, he said, though they asked to listen to the news on the radio because they had been cut off from the rest of the world for so long. Now, at this rest stop, Mr. Bruce watched his passengers shuffle along the food line, accepting plastic bags filled with food and drink. ''This is the first food they've had,'' he said. ''This is it.'' Two of his passengers huddled a few feet away: Shirley Jones Williams, 50, and her husband, Michael, 53, a laborer who looked as if he could not lift a hammer. He said they had been stranded at the South Claiborne Overpass for four days, he in boots, she in just socks. ''That's why my feet are swollen,'' Mrs. Williams said, sobbing. ''No clothes, no nothing. Everything floating in the water.'' She asked the world to know that they were looking for their daughter, Takeba Crosby, and her husband and daughter -- ''my grandbaby,'' she said. The family had lived next door to them in the Ninth Ward, but fled days ago -- maybe to Texas. Mrs. Williams boarded the bus, still with no shoes, followed by her bent husband. Mr. Bruce, the bus driver, called out: ''All right! Let's go, let's go, let's go!'' Where to? ''I'm taking them to Houston,'' he said. ''From there they'll probably be transferred to someplace else.'' The door closed with a hush. The bus pulled out of the tourist center and back onto Interstate 10 darkness. Within a half-mile it passed a sign that flashed a disheartening message from Houston: ''ASTRODOME SHELTER CLOSED -- I-45 TO DALLAS.'' STORM AND CRISIS: HIGHWAY HAVEN"
"As the Bush administration tried to show a more forceful effort to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, government officials on Sunday escalated their criticism and sniping over who was to blame for the problems plaguing the initial response. While rescuers were still trying to reach people stranded by the floods, perhaps the only consensus among local, state and federal officials was that the system had failed. Some federal officials said uncertainty over who was in charge had contributed to delays in providing aid and imposing order, and officials in Louisiana complained that Washington disaster officials had blocked some aid efforts. Local and state resources were so weakened, said Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, that in the future federal authorities need to take ''more of an upfront role earlier on, when we have these truly ultracatastrophes.'' But furious state and local officials insisted that the real problem was that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which Mr. Chertoff's department oversees, failed to deliver urgently needed help and, through incomprehensible red tape, even thwarted others' efforts to help. ''We wanted soldiers, helicopters, food and water,'' said Denise Bottcher, press secretary for Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana. ''They wanted to negotiate an organizational chart.'' Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans expressed similar frustrations. ''We're still fighting over authority,'' he told reporters on Saturday. ''A bunch of people are the boss. The state and federal government are doing a two-step dance.'' In one of several such appeals, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, called on President Bush on Sunday to appoint an independent national commission to examine the relief effort. She also said that she intends to introduce legislation to remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security and restore its previous status as an independent agency with cabinet-level status. Mr. Chertoff tried to deflect the criticism of his department and FEMA by saying there would be time later to decide what went wrong. ''Whatever the criticisms and the after-action report may be about what was right and what was wrong looking back, what would be a horrible tragedy would be to distract ourselves from avoiding further problems because we're spending time talking about problems that have already occurred,'' he told Tim Russert on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. But local officials, who still feel overwhelmed by the continuing tragedy, demanded accountability and as well as action. ''Why did it happen? Who needs to be fired?'' asked Aaron Broussard, president of Jefferson Parish, south of New Orleans. Far from deferring to state or local officials, FEMA asserted its authority and made things worse, Mr. Broussard complained on ''Meet the Press.'' When Wal-Mart sent three trailer trucks loaded with water, FEMA officials turned them away, he said. Agency workers prevented the Coast Guard from delivering 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel, and on Saturday they cut the parish's emergency communications line, leading the sheriff to restore it and post armed guards to protect it from FEMA, Mr. Broussard said. One sign of the continuing battle over who was in charge was Governor Blanco's refusal to sign an agreement proposed by the White House to share control of National Guard forces with the federal authorities. Under the White House plan, Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré would oversee both the National Guard and the active duty federal troops, reporting jointly to the president and Ms. Blanco. ''She would lose control when she had been in control from the very beginning,'' said Ms. Bottcher, the governor's press secretary. Ms. Bottcher was one of several officials yesterday who said she believed FEMA had interfered with the delivery of aid, including offers from the mayor of Chicago, Richard M. Daley, and the governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson. Adam Sharp, a spokesman for Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said the problem was not who was in command. FEMA repeatedly held up assistance that could have been critical, he said. ''FEMA has just been very slow to make these decisions,'' Mr. Sharp said. In a clear slap at Mr. Chertoff and the FEMA director, Michael D. Brown, Governor Blanco announced Saturday that she had hired James Lee Witt, the director of FEMA during the Clinton administration, to advise her on the recovery. Nearly every emergency worker told agonizing stories of communications failures, some of them most likely fatal to victims. Police officers called Senator Landrieu's Washington office because they could not reach commanders on the ground in New Orleans, Mr. Sharp said. Dr. Ross Judice, chief medical officer for a large ambulance company, recounted how on Tuesday, unable to find out when helicopters would land to pick up critically ill patients at the Superdome, he walked outside and discovered that two helicopters, donated by an oil services company, had been waiting in the parking lot. Louisiana and New Orleans have received a total of about $750 million in federal emergency and terrorism preparedness grants in the last four years, Homeland Security Department officials said. Mr. Chertoff said he recognized that the local government's capacity to respond to the disaster was severely compromised by the hurricane and flood. ''What happened here was that essentially, the demolishment of that state and local infrastructure, and I think that really caused the cascading series of breakdowns,'' he said. But Mayor Nagin said the root of the breakdown was the failure of the federal government to deliver relief supplies and personnel quickly. ''They kept promising and saying things would happen,'' he said. ''I was getting excited and telling people that. They kept making promises and promises.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE FALLOUT"
"On Friday afternoon, Leonard Sprague, a general contractor in Gainesville, Fla., saw the electronic plea. ''I hope someone can help,'' someone using the name ZuluOne wrote to an online bulletin board. ''I am trying to get a current overlay for the area around 2203 Curcor Court in Gulfport, Miss.'' Mr. Sprague knew that ''current overlay'' meant a bird's-eye view. And an altruistic impulse combined with an urge to play with a new technology propelled him into action. Using his PC, he superimposed a freshly available posthurricane aerial photograph over a prehurricane image of the same neighborhood. After 15 minutes, he had an answer. ''Actually, it looks like your house looks pretty good,'' Mr. Sprague told ZuluOne by e-mail. ''Unfortunately, it doesn't look so good for some of your neighbors. Best of luck to you and your family.'' In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, hundreds of displaced residents and their relatives -- along with people like Mr. Sprague -- have turned to the Internet for information about a home feared damaged or destroyed. Many are using Google Earth, a program available at the Google Web site that lets users zoom in on any address for an aerial view drawn from a database of satellite photos. By the end of last week, a grass-roots effort had identified scores of posthurricane images, determined the geographical coordinates and visual landmarks to enable their integration into the Google Earth program, and posted them to a Google Earth bulletin board -- the place ZuluOne turned for help. Most of the images originated with the Remote Sensing Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has been posting them to its Web site (noaa.gov) since Wednesday. Taking inspiration from the online volunteers, Google, NASA and Carnegie Mellon University had by Saturday night made the effort more formal, incorporating nearly 4,000 posthurricane images into the Google Earth database (at earth.google.com) for public use. ''It was 100 percent a reaction to what they were doing,'' John Hanke, a general manager who is in charge of the Google Earth service, said on Sunday. ''They knew about the NOAA data before Google did.'' The ready availability of such images to any Web user shows not only the reach of the Internet but also the strides that have been made in the photography. Mike Aslaksen, acting chief of NOAA's Remote Sensing Division, said that while it took a week to process and make public images taken of the World Trade Center after the terrorist attacks four years ago, the post-Katrina images have been available within 24 hours. They are not satellite photos, but aerial images taken from a Cessna Citation jet. Still, they can be readily patched into the Google Earth database as overlays. The images are not crystal clear, and if an area appears to be flooded, it is hard to tell how deep the water is. But the photographic overlays give a sense of a home, street or neighborhood's condition. ''People who have a reason to be personally concerned with what's happening there are motivated to do it,'' Mr. Hanke said. Yet many who have no particular personal connection to the hurricane's devastation joined the effort. Douglas Hillman, a disc jockey and dance instructor who lives near Chicago, created some 80 overlays. He said he was fascinated by Google Earth and also interested in ''the results of a natural disaster, in the way people react to it, and also in the technology used to cover it.'' As for methodology, Mr. Hillman says he downloads an aerial image from the NOAA Web site to his computer, then tweaks it with tools in the Google Earth software until it lines up as closely as possible with the existing satellite image. ''This is not an entirely precise process, as the pictures are taken from slightly different angles, so it's not exact,'' he said. But it is close enough to pinpoint houses, even cars. Kathryn Cramer, a science fiction editor in Pleasantville, N.Y., whose Web site (www.kathryncramer.com) has served as a clearinghouse for overlay information, said the effort started early last week when she and a few others wondered about the exact location of a levee break and created an overlay using a photo from the news media. ''We were getting a lot of decontextualized disaster photos that didn't give you a real understanding of what was happening,'' she said. In a related online collaboration, at www.scipionus.com, people are plastering a Google street map with electronic pushpins marked with information like ''casino boats destroyed'' and ''minor wind damage.'' And at Google Maps, posthurricane images are also available for flooded areas of New Orleans. Of the many lessons learned since the 2001 terrorist attacks, ''one is that there is an overwhelming desire for geospatial data,'' said Mr. Aslaksen of NOAA. ''It's become a tool as necessary as a word processor.'' The intended uses of the NOAA images, of course, are official. For instance, the photos are helping the Army Corps of Engineers to assess levee damage, Mr. Aslaksen said, and NOAA has used them to determine major shoreline changes that might pose a risk, and to see if piers or vessels have sunk. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has also used the images for damage assessment. But Mr. Aslaksen said he welcomed the popular use. ''We thought it important to give the public access to the data,'' he said. Mr. Aslaksen, whose e-mail address is on the NOAA Web site, said he had received nearly a thousand e-mail messages from people seeking information on the condition of their homes. He tries to respond to all of them, he said. Ms. Cramer said she had been able to help nearly two dozen people looking for information about the status of their homes. ''I've been thanked more in the last 48 hours than ever in my life,'' she said Friday. When NASA, Carnegie Mellon and Google began their more formal operation, it made the impromptu efforts of people like Mr. Hillman less crucial. But they filled an important gap, like early volunteers piling sandbags into a breach until the heavy equipment arrives. ''There's not a lot that I can do to directly help, up here in Northern Illinois,'' Mr. Hillman said. ''I'll donate what I can to Red Cross, but beyond that, I feel like this is one actually helpful thing which I can be doing.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: INTERNET MAPPING"
"It was moving day for the families of Gaynell Porretto and Tracy Jackson, the first page of the next chapter in their Hurricane Katrina horror stories. Mrs. Porretto's four-car caravan crammed with a lifetime of photo albums, a few changes of clothes and coolers of drinks pulled up to a yellow house with a wide front porch that she had just rented for $600 in the humble hamlet of Arnaudville, La. It is 125 miles from her storm-sacked home in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, half the size for twice as many people, but she can see the church steeple from the yard, and her son is signed up for football at the nearby high school. ''I have a ZIP code!'' she said, exulting. ''It's the happiest I've ever been.'' Outside the New Orleans airport here, Ms. Jackson's four sickly and hungry children, ages 1, 3, 5 and 7, were sprawled on a skycap's cart as she slogged through the sweaty, snail-like line, the baby atop a blue plastic bin filled with what they had scrounged from strangers. It is all they have, their $2,000 cash savings burned up with their belongings -- including birth certificates -- in a post-flood fire at their apartment in uptown New Orleans. Even as they waited to board a plane, they did not know where they were taking it. ''I'm just hoping it's a better place,'' she whispered. ''I've never been on an airplane before, I'm afraid of heights.'' Two families displaced by the same disaster, both facing uncertain futures as they moved forward on Saturday, but in completely divergent circumstances. Just as it ripped through levees to send water pouring through New Orleans, the storm cleaved a harsh chasm among the region's refugees, providing a stark portrait of the vast divide between America's haves and have-nots. The more than 100 members of Mrs. Porretto's extended family have cars that carried them out last Sunday morning, well before the hurricane hit. Ms. Jackson, who does not know how to drive, escaped on foot only after the floodwaters started filling her apartment on Tuesday, walking first to a bridge, then to the squalid Superdome. Mrs. Porretto, 51, has an American Express card that covered her $564.26 bill at the Hilton in Lafayette, La., where a cousin who works for AT&T secured a low corporate rate when she booked a block of rooms days before of the storm. Ms. Jackson, 24, does not have a bank account, and her husband, Jerel Brown, spent their last $25 to buy fish and shrimp from men grilling on the street in the chaos, so now there is nothing in the pockets of his baggy jeans but a crushed pack of Benson & Hedges someone gave him to calm him down. The Porrettos have cellphones and connections in city government and churches that not only helped them find one of the last available rental properties anywhere around here, but also let them sneak back into their neighborhood early this weekend to grab televisions and furnishings for their new house. Mr. Brown, in tears, has no recourse but to ask a reporter to look for his missing brother, Wallace, and if he turned up, find out how they could get back in touch. John Edwards, the former senator whose presidential primary campaign last year was based on the theme that America is a country torn in two by race and class, sent an e-mail to supporters last week, saying that the hurricane's destruction exposed ''a harsher example of two Americas.'' ''Every single resident of New Orleans, regardless of their wealth or status, will have terrible losses and life-altering experiences,'' Mr. Edwards wrote. But poor people, he added, ''suffered the most from Katrina because they always suffer the most.'' Mrs. Porretto, a court clerk, and her husband, Joel, a retired police officer, are hardly rich. But as they embark on life in exile, they look like royalty compared with Mr. Brown, Ms. Jackson and their children, wandering to a destination unknown with little more than the clothes they have worn for a week. ''We don't know where we're going, we don't know how we're going to survive when we get there -- we're starting all over,'' Mr. Brown said as he stood in line for three hours in the airport's heat. ''I never been out of this city. I'm going to be a stranger.'' Nearly one in four of New Orleans' 445,000 residents live in poverty, many of them in neighborhoods like the one where the Jackson-Brown clan huddled in a $350-a-month two-bedroom apartment across from a dilapidated and dangerous housing project; 69 percent of the city is black, and the median household income is $31,369. To the west in Metairie, where Ellen DeGeneres grew up, the median income is $41,265, just below the national average, 87 percent of the 145,000 residents are white, and fewer than 1 in 10 are poor. But in the hurricane's wake, the poorest have turned desperately destitute, while the well-to-do make do with what they have left. For the past week, the Porrettos and their many cousins converged at the Hilton, Lafayette's finest hotel, drinking red wine late into the night as they laughed in the lobby. The teenagers put a dollar on a string in front of the elevator, watching guests lunge for it as they yanked it away. The adults stayed up until 2 a.m. daring the dozens of dogs among the evacuated to strut their stuff. ''Every dog that did a trick, we drank a beer,'' Mrs. Porretto explained. But some days, she stayed in bed depressed through the afternoon, or burst into tears out of nowhere. Their house has roof damage, and they do not yet know what the water has wrought inside. A Ford Taurus full of prized possessions that her husband parked outside Macy's to ride out the storm has been ravaged. The court where she has worked for 25 years is closed indefinitely. Her sister Kathy Skeins, whose family of four will share the little house along with Mrs. Porretto's 78-year-old mother-in-law, is worried about how her boys, 15 and 11, will fare in public school for the first time, and what will happen to the $3,500 tuition she already paid at the Catholic school back home. ''It hit us Monday that we were homeless,'' Mrs. Porretto said. ''We have meltdowns. You just have nothing to look forward to.'' Until they found the shotgun-style house in Arnaudville, a town of 1,400 down a long country road north of Lafayette. On Saturday, as the two sisters unpacked the storm-survival arsenal they had amassed at the hotel -- pounds of ham for sandwiches and a new toaster oven, all manner of snacks and condiments, even a bottle of olives to ease Mrs. Porretto's arthritis -- a neighbor stopped by with a box of cleaning supplies. The landlord, who is lending an air mattress and queen bed, drew a map to the nearby restaurant and movie theater. The women debated whether they need a land line, but agreed cable television was a must, and set out shopping to stock their new shelves. ''We need to make a list, Gay,'' Mrs. Skeins said. ''We need a mop and a broom, so we can keep up the kitchen.'' Mrs. Porretto propped a photo collage of her son's first year on a bedroom windowsill, and imagined the morning sun streaming in through the living room. The sisters stocked the refrigerator with bottles of Coors Light they had brought. ''Gotta relax some way,'' Mrs. Skeins said. ''We'll sit on the porch and have a cold beer.'' ''We've got a porch, Kathy, I can't wait!'' Mrs. Porretto said, forgetting the hurricane for a minute. ''We grew up with a porch!'' On moving day, Mrs. Porretto wore a clean T-shirt and fresh lipstick. Two hours' drive away at the airport, Ms. Jackson was braless under her soiled shirt and had a blue bandana covering her unwashed hair. The Skeins' 125-pound Rottweiler, Buster, galloped across the grass in Arnaudville to drink from a spigot, after a week squished in a hotel bathroom; the Jackson children are without their mutt, Max, last seen as their apartment began to burn. ''We heard the dog barking,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''I think he's dead.'' Like the Porrettos, Ms. Jackson, Mr. Brown, their children, a nephew and a friend they call Auntie left New Orleans last Sunday morning, to stay with a friend. But they went back on Tuesday, and as the water rose to waist level, they fled with no provisions. After two nights shielding the baby's eyes from dead bodies at the feces-infested Superdome, they set out for the convention center, where rumors of rapes and worse left them taking turns sleeping on the floor in fear for their children's safety. ''Last night I heard a baby screaming, 'Stop, stop, get off me, don't touch me,''' Ms. Jackson recalled. Their blue plastic bin is filled not with family treasures, but with scraps that other refugees and relief workers have handed out: three rolls of toilet paper, a box of Teddy Grahams, toddlers blue plastic sandals, two apples, a gallon of milk. Mr. Brown was barefoot until a friend gave him a pair of sneakers that remain unlaced because they are too small; he has no socks. An elderly lady gave Ms. Jackson a quilted handbag to hold diapers and the pink pills the triage nurse gave to 7-year-old Waynenisha, who suffers from febrile seizures. ''It has some perfume and some body spray,'' she said thankfully. ''I'm a lady. I can't walk around smelling like a grown man.'' Now, Ms. Jackson is wondering whether she will be able to enroll her children in school without identification -- even her own Social Security card is gone. Mr. Brown, who had been making do washing 18-wheelers and running errands for a convenience store, said he will ''go there and get a job if they let me,'' though he is still unsure where there might be. ''We just started life's journey together,'' he said, gesturing at the little ones on the luggage cart. ''As we're building, it just all fell apart at one time.'' Standing in the sweltering line, Mr. Brown occasionally lashed out, slapping the leg of a child on the move or barking at others in line for pushing. When an older woman passed out on the curb, he pushed through the crowd to pour water down her head and back. ''Where's the help?'' he called out. ''We need help! Give her some air, please.'' A few minutes later, the Rev. Jesse Jackson turned up with three buses. The Jackson-Browns leaped out of line to rush aboard with their blue plastic bin and grabbed the last row in the air-conditioned coach, leaving the skycap's cart behind. STORM AND CRISIS: THE ECONOMIC DIVIDE"
"When President Bush toured the flattened Point Cadet neighborhood in Biloxi, Miss., to survey the damage from Hurricane Katrina, he was almost literally walking in the footsteps of another president, Richard M. Nixon. In 1969, Mr. Nixon had come to Gulfport, only 10 miles away, in the wake of the terror of Hurricane Camille. Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican, recalled to reporters before Mr. Bush's arrival on Friday that he had been in Gulfport for Mr. Nixon's visit that day and that the landing of Air Force One with the American flag on its tail was one of the most beautiful things he had ever seen. That visit, Mr. Lott said, brought hope to the shattered residents, himself included. ''When the president comes, it's not about him,'' Mr. Lott said, as recounted in The Sun-Herald, the local newspaper. ''It's about reassurances to the people.'' The message that Mr. Bush's visit aimed to deliver was more complicated. This president was seeking not only to comfort, but also to reverse the impression that the federal government had failed in its response to Hurricane Katrina's most desperate victims. His trip, and a follow-up visit to Louisiana that he is planning today, nonetheless illustrated the continuity in the way modern presidents react to natural disasters and the hand-holding, coupled with direction and purpose, that Americans have come to expect from the occupants of the Oval Office during a crisis. ''It's something that now, with instant communications, we really want from a president,'' said Michael K. Deaver, who was President Ronald Reagan's image czar. ''It's something that the national psyche needs when there's a disaster, a threat, a trauma. We want somebody there to tell us, 'We will survive, we will get through it.' It's like I used to say of Reagan: he was America, and America was him. That's what we want.'' Kenneth M. Duberstein, Mr. Reagan's last White House chief of staff, put it this way: ''You've got to be both a rabbi and a priest ministering to the people, but also a chief executive who directs recovery and marshals resources. Everybody looks to the president at a moment of crisis, not to the Congress. And so you have to be that larger-than-life figure.'' Whether Americans are satisfied they got all that from Mr. Bush in this crisis is unclear, as the president has come under extraordinary criticism from Democrats, Republicans, local officials and victims for his handling of the disaster. In recognition of that, Mr. Bush refocused his hurricane rhetoric in a speech in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday. Rather than praising Republican politicians for their work in the region, as he did with Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi on Friday, Mr. Bush switched to a more personal acknowledgment that people were in pain and that his administration had fallen short. Then he vowed to set things right. ''I know that those of you who have been hit hard by Katrina are suffering,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Many are angry and desperate for help. The tasks before us are enormous, but so is the heart of America. In America, we do not abandon our fellow citizens in their hour of need.'' But did his words come in time? Are they enough? ''These are the kinds of moments when a president gives voice to the country,'' said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the presidential biographer. ''They're remembered forever, if it's done right.'' In Ms. Goodwin's view, Abraham Lincoln did it right with the Gettysburg Address, as did Franklin D. Roosevelt when he asked Americans to buy maps and follow along with him as he explained the strategic World War II battle sites in a 1942 radio address. Mr. Reagan, she said, caught the moment when he eulogized the astronauts lost in the 1986 Challenger explosion. And so did Mr. Bush, she said, when he grabbed the bullhorn in the rubble of the World Trade Center in 2001, one of the most lasting images of his presidency. This time, Ms. Goodwin said, ''he may be able to say something good in the weeks ahead, but at least as it appears right now, that moment that calls for the president has passed.'' White House officials and some of Mr. Bush's supporters disagreed, among them Victoria Clarke, the former Pentagon spokeswoman, who said that ''at a certain point here, people will realize that some awfully good efforts were made'' and that ''a lot of people did a hell of a good job.'' For Ms. Clarke, the politics of natural disaster had a familiar ring, since it was almost exactly 13 years ago to the day that she was defending Mr. Bush's father against accusations that he had been slow in his response to Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida. In fact, when Bill Clinton, who was running for president at the time, said that efforts should be made to look into the problems that plagued disaster relief in Florida and Louisiana in 1992, Ms. Clarke, a Bush campaign spokeswoman, retorted that Mr. Clinton was ''trying to exploit what is a terrible situation for political gain'' and that ''he should be ashamed of himself.'' Mr. Clinton is now working with the first President Bush to raise money for hurricane victims. As for Ms. Clarke, she said that the change in intensity in the news media in the last 13 years -- cable channels showed around-the-clock images of people dying in New Orleans last week -- had sharply increased the demands on the president. ''People want and expect more of a personal connection,'' she said. ''He has to be commander in chief, and he has to be holding those hands.'' White House Letter"
"Two news photographs ricocheted through the Internet last week and set off a debate about race and the news media in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The first photo, taken by Dave Martin, an Associated Press photographer in New Orleans, shows a young black man wading through water that has risen to his chest. He is clutching a case of soda and pulling a floating bag. The caption provided by The A.P. says he has just been ''looting a grocery store.'' The second photo, also from New Orleans, was taken by Chris Graythen for Getty Images and distributed by Agence France-Presse. It shows a white couple up to their chests in the same murky water. The woman is holding some bags of food. This caption says they are shown ''after finding bread and soda from a local grocery store.'' Both photos turned up Tuesday on Yahoo News, which posts automatic feeds of articles and photos from wire services. Soon after, a user of the photo-sharing site Flickr juxtaposed the images and captions on a single page, which attracted links from many blogs. The left-leaning blog Daily Kos linked to the page with the comment, ''It's not looting if you're white.'' The contrast of the two photo captions, which to many indicated a double standard at work, generated widespread anger toward the news media that quickly spread beyond the Web. On Friday night, the rapper Kanye West ignored the teleprompter during NBC's live broadcast of ''A Concert for Hurricane Relief,'' using the opportunity to lambaste President Bush and criticize the press. ''I hate the way they portray us in the media,'' he said. ''You see a black family, it says they're looting. You see a white family, it says they're looking for food.'' Many bloggers were quick to point out that the photos came from two different agencies, and so could not reflect the prejudice of a single media outlet. A writer on the blog BoingBoing wrote: ''Perhaps there's more factual substantiation behind each copywriter's choice of words than we know. But to some, the difference in tone suggests racial bias, implicit or otherwise.'' According to the agencies, each photographer captioned his own photograph. Jack Stokes, a spokesman for The A.P., said that photographers are told to describe what they have seen when they write a caption. Mr. Stokes said The A.P. had guidelines in place before Hurricane Katrina struck to distinguish between ''looting'' and ''carrying.'' If a photographer sees a person enter a business and emerge with goods, it is described as looting. Otherwise The A.P. calls it carrying. Mr. Stokes said that Mr. Martin had seen the man in his photograph wade into a grocery store and come out with the sodas and bag, so by A.P.'s definition, the man had looted. The photographer for Getty Images, Mr. Graythen, said in an e-mail message that he had also stuck to what he had seen to write his caption, and had actually given the wording a great deal of thought. Mr. Graythen described seeing the couple near a corner store from an elevated expressway. The door to the shop was open, and things had floated out to the street. He was not able to talk to the couple, ''so I had to draw my own conclusions,'' he said. In the extreme conditions of New Orleans, Mr. Graythen said, taking necessities like food and water to survive could not be considered stealing. He said that had he seen people coming out of stores with computers and DVD players, he would have considered that looting. ''If you're taking something that runs solely from a wall outlet that requires power from the electric company -- when we are not going to have power for weeks, even months -- that's inexcusable,'' he said. Since the photo was published last Tuesday Mr. Graythen has received more than 500 e-mail messages, most of them supportive, he said. Within three hours of the photo's publication online, editors at Agence France-Presse rewrote Mr. Graythen's caption. But the original caption remained online as part of a Yahoo News slide show. Under pressure to keep up with the news, and lacking the time for a discussion about word choice, Olivier Calas, the agency's director of multimedia, asked Yahoo to remove the photo last Thursday. Now, in its place, when readers seek the picture of the couple, a statement from Neil Budde, the general manager of Yahoo News, appears in its place. The statement emphasizes that Yahoo News did not write the photo captions and that it did not edit the captions, so that the photos can be made available as quickly as possible. Mr. Calas said Agence France-Presse was bombarded with e-mail messages complaining about the caption. He said the caption was unclear and should have been reworded earlier. ''This was a consequence of a series of negligences, not ill intent,'' he said. For Mr. Graythen, whose parents and grandparents lost their homes in the disaster, the fate of the survivors was the most important thing. In his e-mail message he wrote: ''Now is no time to pass judgment on those trying to stay alive. Now is no time to argue semantics about finding versus looting. Now is no time to argue if this is a white versus black issue.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE PHOTOGRAPHS"
"The floodwaters had exploded through the siding of the small wooden house, and through the exposed wall beams, it was now possible to see fragments of the life it once contained: curled snapshots of family members taped to the walls, a yellowing poster of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech about a dream, an old, sodden sofa. And below it all was a two-inch carpet of stinking mud. There will no longer be life in this house, on the corner of Feliciana and North Miro streets. Or in most of the other houses, similarly stricken, that stretch to the horizon through these impoverished and now ruined sections of the city's Bywater and Lower Ninth Ward neighborhoods. Just a few days ago, these streets were underwater, impassable except by boat. The waterline was nearly to the roofs, where search teams had spray-painted their grim runes. But on Thursday the water had begun to recede, and for the first time since the storm it was possible to see the details of the devastation inflicted on the city and some of its poorest residents. The gray clapboard house two blocks up had fallen down on itself. An emaciated dog sat on its wrecked front porch, its head down. The pink house just down the street had lost its front door -- it was in the living room. The white house a little further down was just a skeleton, with the siding peeling off and no interior walls left. Some homes had simply fallen down. Others that were more sturdy had their insides gutted. With the water gone, thick, brown-black, sulfurous sludge was left, encrusting everything. In most cases, personal effects were nowhere to be found. The floodwaters washed away all but the largest items -- couches, televisions, dressers, even aquariums. A few items were salvageable inside one house: a framed photo of the rapper Tupac Shakur hung on the wall, along with a high school diploma and a photograph of a young woman; a DVD of Will Smith's movie ''Enemy of the State'' sat atop a toppled stereo case. The sound and dust of bulldozers is likely to be here soon. Mayor C. Ray Nagin suggested at a news conference Thursday that half the city's homes may have to come down. ''It's my take from talking to experts that most of the homes that were flooded, that stayed in the water for a number of weeks, mostly likely will have to be destroyed,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''We're probably conservatively saying that half of the city's homes are probably rebuildable.'' But many of the homes in this neighborhood -- on the other side of the railroad tracks and a few miles from downtown -- are likely to be in the other half. ''A lot of these houses are going to have to come down,'' said Juan C. Spencer, 29, a New Orleans firefighter. He was driving through the neighborhood Thursday in an S.U.V. with his friend, Jermaine R. Perry, 31, also a firefighter, to check on the homes of a few friends. Mr. Perry was on his cellphone with Hattie Matthews, 48, whose elderly uncle had been living at 2410 Feliciana Street, in a brick home that had fared relatively well compared with some of its counterparts. Still, Ms. Matthews said she doubted it could be saved, given how long it had been submerged. ''We know we can't go back in and live there,'' she said, adding that she had canceled the homeowners insurance before the storm because it was too expensive. Her uncle's block was almost entirely brown: a cascade of brown mud, with brown cars parked askew, half on the sidewalk, half on the street. A brown tree cradled a black chair in its branches. A brown toilet lay on its side in the middle of the street. It is unclear whether the neighborhood and others like it will ever house people again, whether they can ever be properly protected by a system of walls and levees and pumps that failed so spectacularly three weeks ago. Like so much of New Orleans, the Ninth Ward is unnatural. Its houses were erected over marsh stiffened by landfill. ''Can the Ninth Ward be protected -- or can it ever be protected -- by the levee system?'' asked Lionel C. McIntyre, an associate professor in Columbia University's School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation who grew up in New Orleans. Mr. Nagin said that outside experts, including some from Holland and Germany, have come to the city to help analyze what sections are risky to redevelop and what are not, and what type of levee system is needed. Only after those assessments are made will residents of those areas be allowed back in, he said. Any discussion about rebuilding must take equity among neighborhoods into account, Professor McIntyre said. ''Other than Uptown, the rest of the city is just as vulnerable to flooding as the Ninth Ward,'' he said. ''Do we just salvage the Tchoupitoulas-to-St. Charles corridor and the French Quarter and call it a day?'' Some say that a few of the most severely mangled houses might be livable again. It is sometimes surprising how damaged homes can be rebuilt, said Thomas L. Jackson, a civil and structural engineer from New Orleans and a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. Siding can be hammered back on, floors replaced and walls rebuilt. In New Orleans, much is also dependent on the health risks of the toxic mud and on the quality of the housing before the storm. ''If it was rundown and rickety before the storm, it's not worth fixing,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''It's a replacement.'' How long the structures were submerged is also a major factor in their fate. ''The big concern these days is mold,'' said Craig E. Colten, a professor of geography at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. ''The more thorough the saturation, the deeper the mold gets in. The longer it takes to dry, the longer the mold has to get established as well.'' Dr. Colten said the city should not attempt to rebuild in the most vulnerable areas. ''The ideal use of those lowest areas would allow them to serve as flood-retention basins, so when the next flood comes, the water can collect in places where it won't harm people and property,'' he said. ''We need to think very carefully about helping people relocate from those areas, transplant themselves and their communities into new locales that are less vulnerable.'' Many others, including local politicians and neighborhood leaders, strongly disagree and have vowed to restart a community here. But it is hard at this moment to imagine life returning to these blocks. On the southeast corner of Feliciana and North Rocheblave Street, a bent sign on the front lawn of yet another badly damaged home signaled the intentions that at least one homeowner had before the storm. The house was for sale. STORM AND CRISIS: THE DAMAGE"
"Evacuees at a shelter here said they took comfort Thursday night from both the substance and the symbolism of the speech President Bush gave in the city many of them had fled. When Mr. Bush talked about breaking the cycle of poverty and increasing the rate of home ownership on the Gulf Coast, one evacuee shouted, ''Thank you! Thank you!'' Others at the shelter, at the civic center in Houma, a small city southwest of New Orleans, nodded in approval at several points during the speech. ''I feel very encouraged because he's accepted responsibility, and in doing that, I feel that he has stepped up to the plate,'' said Evelyn Green, 58, a retired health care worker from the New Orleans area. ''He touched me. I know now he's going to be there to help us rebuild our cities and towns. I take him at his word. I want to see everything he said tonight fulfilled.'' Another evacuee, Muhammad Abdullah Ali, a 52-year-old security officer from New Orleans, said: ''I feel that now he's going to take control and do the best he can. I felt good about the speech. It was a good speech. Now I want to see some action.'' Others said they appreciated Mr. Bush's specific references to New Orleans culture and were glad to see the president speaking from Jackson Square, a familiar and comforting image from home. The president's comments were greeted with praise from local officials, including Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, a Democrat. ''Louisiana's people are strong, optimistic and determined to rebuild this great region,'' Ms. Blanco said, ''but we cannot do it without the resources of our nation and our government. I take the president at his word when he says those resources will be there when we need them.'' Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, described Mr. Bush's proposals as ''innovative and bold'' and said: ''The president picked a very inspiring spot to make this speech. The image is worth many words in terms of what Jackson Square and the cathedral mean to New Orleans and what New Orleans means to the nation.'' But the Rev. Jesse Jackson said that even the president's nod to poverty and race issues would have to be matched by actions. ''I thought there was a sense of urgency,'' Mr. Jackson said about the speech. ''I think he backed into the war on poverty, and touched on the issues of race and poverty and class obliquely, which is new for him.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE REACTION"
"If a huge natural or man-made disaster ever struck Long Island, there would be several local, state and federal plans in place to help people, according to officials in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Evacuating the island, however, is not one of them. Stretching eastward 118 miles from the United States mainland into the Atlantic Ocean, Long Island and its nearly three million residents have only a few highways or rail lines out -- including the infamously jammed Long Island Expressway -- and all of them lead into parts of New York City, which has its own evacuation problems. As a result, most Long Islanders would be forced to deal with such a major disaster by staying closer to home, according to the Nassau and Suffolk county executives. ''Impossible,'' said Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive in Nassau, which has more than 1.3 million residents. ''We couldn't evacuate everybody.'' Steve Levy, executive of Suffolk County, home to 1.4 million people, said: ''We recognize that in certain situations, it would be impossible to evacuate Long Island. It would probably create more chaos.'' Consider, county officials said, three million people trying to flee an approaching hurricane using the island's three main east-west arteries: the expressway and the two smaller highways to the north and south, the Northern State and the Southern State Parkways. ''The east-west is always the very serious and troubling component,'' said Ed Dumas, a spokesman for Mr. Levy. ''The roads don't have the capacity to handle the kind of bodies you're talking about.'' Instead, both county executives said, their counties have plans to move residents at or near shorelines to the middle of the island, as far as possible from the ocean and the 15-to-18-foot waves that could come with a Category 5 hurricane. Both counties have evacuation plans for limited disasters -- for example, if ocean waters flooded the southern shores as far north as Sunrise Highway, affecting 200,000 people in Nassau County alone. In that case, residents would be moved to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, in Uniondale, and two nearby locations, Mr. Suozzi said. ''We could house maybe 45,000 people,'' he said. Suffolk officials estimate that a Category 4 hurricane would require evacuating or relocating as many as 250,000 residents, about a sixth of the population. In light of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina and the evacuations caused by Hurricane Rita in eastern Texas, Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau county executive, said he led a meeting on Wednesday among some 50 state, county and local government officials to discuss emergency response. ''We have a very detailed hurricane-preparedness plan for Nassau County,'' said Mr. Suozzi, whose emergency management office is located in the basement of the county jail. ''But we're looking at everything again.'' One major need, Mr. Suozzi said, is the creation of a longer-lasting emergency power source for the coliseum if it had to house up to 20,000 shoreline evacuees. On Tuesday, he and Mr. Levy will discuss the idea with officials of the Long Island Power Authority. Reciprocal disaster-response plans that include several city and county governments are vital to any coordinated regional response, experts say. Westchester County, for example, has a detailed mutual-aid pact with New York City to provide firefighters and doctors in a large-scale emergency, said Anthony W. Sutton, commissioner of the county Emergency Services department. Though Nassau and Suffolk also have agreements in place with New York for disaster aid, the counties' own emergency response plans are based on the assumption -- no longer valid, county officials say, after Washington's slow response to Gulf Coast storm victims -- that the federal government would quickly arrive with vast resources. ''After Katrina, we realized the cavalry might not come,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We're checking our stockpile'' of medicine, food and water, he said."
"Energy prices tumbled yesterday and share prices edged up as Hurricane Rita appeared to weaken, stirring hopes that the storm will cause less damage than expected to refineries and other energy operations along the Gulf Coast. ''It's down to a Category 3 now,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. ''That probably won't be all that damaging to the oil facilities.'' Yet even as the storm weakened, businesses and investors remained concerned about the potential disruption to an energy infrastructure still crippled last month by Hurricane Katrina. Crude oil futures for November fell $2.31 yesterday, to $64.19 a barrel in New York trading. The October contract for natural gas fell 46 cents, to $12.32 a cubic foot, while the October gasoline contract fell more than 5 cents, to just over $2.08 a gallon. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about 28.5 percent of the nation's crude oil production and 60 percent of crude imports; 47 percent of the country's refining capacity and 20 percent of its natural gas supply. Four refineries that were shut after Hurricane Katrina remain closed. So it is unsurprising that as the latest storm approached, economists focused on the energy industry. ''A loss of another 5 percent of refining capacity for an extended period that sends the gasoline price to $4, would hit consumer spending power by knocking around 1.5 percent off real disposable incomes,'' according to an analysis by economic research firm Global Insight. ''A more severe disruption would likely mean not just higher gasoline prices but widespread shortages and lines at the pump -- causing major disruption to normal economic activity.'' As the Gulf Coast prepared for Hurricane Rita, the financial fallout from Katrina continued. The New Orleans subsidiary of the Entergy Corporation, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday. Entergy New Orleans said it would also borrow up to $200 million from its parent. ''We took this action after careful review of the various options available to preserve Entergy New Orleans' business over the near and long term,'' the chief executive of Entergy New Orleans, Dan Packer, said in a statement. Entergy has estimated that the restoration costs for its New Orleans operations could top $325 million. Entergy, whose Entergy New Orleans unit has lost up to an estimated 130,000 customers because of the hurricane, puts the unit's storm-related costs at $325 million to $475 million. Entergy, which provides electricity to a large part of the Gulf Coast, said Hurricane Katrina had caused the bankruptcy filing by destroying operations and leaving customers unable to pay their bills, disrupting revenue. Despite Rita's weakening, most energy companies in the region were battening down. By yesterday, 16 refineries from Houston to Port Charles, La., accounting for some four million barrels of refining capacity a day, had shut down or were shutting down. ''We continue to make plans and gather resources -- from housing to food to financial assistance -- to support our refineries and retail operations before, during and after the hurricane. Our recovery planning is in full gear,'' said a spokeswoman from Valero Energy, which shut its refineries in Houston, Texas City and Port Arthur, and reduced production at plants in Krotz Springs, Memphis and Lima. The Energy Department also reported that several pipelines in the area, including the Seaway crude pipeline that runs from the Texas coast to Cushing, Okla., had been shut or had reduced capacity. A substantial part of the nation's chemical industry is also clustered in the area. And as Rita approached, the plants were preparing for a major hit. Dow Chemical had shut six plants in Texas by Thursday afternoon. BASF evacuated six plants in Texas, including its largest integrated chemical plant in North America, which is in Freeport and a naphtha cracker in Port Arthur. ''There's a lot more capacity in Rita's path than there was in Katrina's,'' warned Kevin Swift, chief economist of the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry's main trade group. The energy shutdown is starting to pinch in some areas. In Houston, there were some reports of gas stations running out of gasoline. And the governor of Georgia said all public schools would be closed on Monday and Tuesday to save fuel. Though the main concern over Rita regards energy, businesses of all sorts -- images of Katrina's devastation still fresh in their minds -- are redoubling efforts to prepare. Wal-Mart and Home Depot have sent additional shipments of essential items -- water, batteries, dry ice, cleaning supplies, gas cans and generators -- as well as supplies that will be needed for the cleanup like tarpaulins, rope and duct tape. Taking a lesson from the looting in New Orleans, Wal-Mart instructed managers to remove guns and other firearms from stores in the hurricane's path. ''We emphasized to store managers step by step how to deal with those items,'' said Jason Jackson, the director of Wal-Mart's emergency operations center. The Hibernia Corporation, the bank based in New Orleans, which moved some of its check- and loan-processing operations to Houston after Katrina, loaded up about 600 employees Thursday morning on chartered buses to take them to a third processing site in Shreveport, La. ''We've always had the three processing centers, but now two of them -- New Orleans and Houston -- are down,'' a spokesman, Ian McNulty, said. The bank, which still has 42 bank branches closed in New Orleans because of Katrina, shut 72 branches in Texas and Southwest Louisiana ahead of Rita, Mr. McNulty said. But the bank's mainframes and servers, which hold customer-account information and connect the ATM networks, were moved to Dallas and Shreveport after Katrina. Sanders Morris Harris, the Houston-based investment bank, has backed up its computer servers to two locations in New York City and Garden City, N.Y. It has posted an alternative number on its Web site for people to call and if telephone service is still up in Houston, calls will be forwarded to New York. STORM AND CRISIS: THE SHUTDOWN"
"A bus evacuating frail residents from a suburban Houston senior-living center burst into flames and was rocked by explosions on a traffic-choked highway south of Dallas early Friday, leaving behind a charred and grisly wreck and two dozen dead. Harry Wilson, 78, one of the survivors, said smoke had begun pouring out of a wheel well on the bus around 6:30 a.m., not long after the driver had stopped to change a tire. Later, when the bus was back on the road, there was a pop, Mr. Wilson said, and the driver pulled over again near the town of Wilmer, about 15 miles south of Dallas. Within minutes the bus filled with smoke. The driver, assisted by other motorists, fire department personnel and a deputy sheriff, struggled to get the passengers off, and they succeeded with some, including Mr. Wilson. But then oxygen canisters in the passenger compartment and in cargo holds erupted in a series of explosions, engulfing the vehicle in flames and forcing the rescuers outside. Some tried to smash the windows to save passengers, but the heat drove them back. ''It was mass hysteria, a lot of screaming,'' Mr. Wilson said, weeping, as he was being wheeled out of Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas on Friday evening. ''What I recall is the bus blew up. Let's put it this way, the fire department pulled me out of there like a newborn baby.'' Two of the passengers had been evacuated from senior facilities in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, three weeks ago, according to local officials; at least one of those passengers died. The bus was transporting 38 residents and five employees of Brighton Gardens, an assisted-living center and nursing home with 140 residents in Bellaire, a small city of 16,000 a few miles southwest of downtown Houston. A relative of one employee was also on board. The bus had left the facility at 3 p.m. Thursday, meaning it had been on the hot, congested highways for more than 14 hours when the tragedy occurred. Fearing that Hurricane Rita would pulverize Houston, and mindful of the deaths of dozens of nursing home residents in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama during Katrina, the facility's managers decided to relocate its residents to another site in Dallas owned by the same company, Sunrise Senior Living, which operates 420 centers in four countries. Coming amid a mass exodus from the Houston area and the Texas Gulf Coast on Thursday that clogged every highway leading inland, the bus disaster underlined concerns that the evacuation had been mishandled, sending too many people onto roads that could not accommodate them. A new, 20-mile traffic jam was created by the wreckage, further exacerbating the problem and forcing authorities to close the interstate and divert traffic. The tragedy also seemed to serve as an eerie mirror image of the deaths of New Orleans nursing home residents who had been abandoned in that stricken city. ''I thought the evacuation was ill-conceived from the beginning,'' said Mr. Wilson's son, Jeffrey Wilson, 47. ''To evacuate people who are not mobile, but who are then stuck on the bus. They didn't really have to be up here.'' Sarah Evers, a spokeswoman for Sunrise, defended the decision as appropriate in advance of Hurricane Rita, which had been forecast to affect the community. ''Resident safety was our primary concern,'' she said. ''We are absolutely shocked and saddened by what happened.'' Cindy Siegel, the mayor of Bellaire, also backed the decision. ''If you recall, 24 hours ago, we expected to take the full brunt of Hurricane Rita,'' she said. Paul Williams, director of external affairs for the Assisted Living Federation of America, said memories of Katrina's deaths were still fresh. ''I've talked to several facilities in Houston and obviously, in light of what happened in New Orleans, people are much more likely to err on the side of being completely safe and not hesitating to move people,'' he said. Brighton Gardens is both a nursing home, where extensive care is provided to the very weak, and an assisted-living center, for more independent residents, and it was not immediately clear which type of residents were on the bus. Police and company officials said they were rushing to identify the remains and to notify the families. None of the dead were employees of Brighton Gardens, Ms. Evers said. Mr. Wilson and nine other survivors, including the driver, were taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital on Friday morning. Only one of those admitted was severely injured, and her condition was upgraded from critical to stable by Friday evening. Other survivors were taken to other hospitals. The injuries included cuts, scrapes, burns and the results of smoke inhalation, said Terry Jones, the interim chief nursing officer at the hospital. The greater distress was mental, she said. ''There is also a lot of anxiety among these patients as they ask us, 'Who made it?''' Ms. Jones said. ''We can't answer that question.'' A team from the National Transportation Safety Board was dispatched to investigate the incident, though it was expected to be days and perhaps weeks before a clear picture of the cause would emerge. Health care facilities must follow national guidelines on the storage and use of oxygen, said Burton Klein, a health care, fire and electrical safety consultant based in Boston. The federal government regulates the transport of large volumes of oxygen, but Mr. Klein said he doubted that there are any rules about the use and storage of the gas on private buses. Airlines and Amtrak have their own guidelines that usually limit oxygen to one canister per person. Upon arriving at Brighton Gardens, Tammy Cumings, the company's area sales manager, said, ''We're absolutely horrified.'' She added, ''We just wanted to hear that they got to a safe place.'' Behind the metal gates, a police vehicle was parked, keeping watch over the two-story garden apartments stretching over a manicured lawn. The facility's Web site boasts of ''attractive suites complete with full bath,'' wall-to-wall carpeting and an emergency response system in every apartment. The facility signed a contract with a national bus chartering company to provide two buses to carry its residents to Dallas. That company, the Chicago-based BusBank, hired Global Limo, a small chartering company with 6 vehicles and 10 drivers in McAllen, far south of Houston on the Mexican border. The other bus, carrying 16 residents, was also from Global Limo and arrived without incident. William R. Maulsby, chief executive of The BusBank, said it had never had any problems with Global Limo's buses. ''In our opinion, it's a good operation with a good safety record,'' he said. ''Obviously, something awful happened here.'' A woman answering the phone at the limousine company declined to comment. But a few hours later, the company's co-owner, James H. Maples, issued a statement. ''We at Global Limo are deeply grieved over the tragedy that occurred this morning,'' he said. ''As of this time, we have no official information from law enforcement.'' Public records show that Mr. Maples, who briefly played professional football for the old Baltimore Colts, and Virginia K. Maples filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the bus company in February. Kelly McKinnis, a lawyer in McAllen who represents Mr. Maples in those proceedings, said the bankruptcy ''absolutely'' did not affect the company's ability to operate safely. According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, a division of the Department of Transportation, four of Global Limo's buses were inspected in the last two years and none were taken out of service. No accidents were reported. The remains of the bus and its occupants were taken to a nearby county truck facility, where the bodies were transferred to a refrigerated morgue truck. ''What's left are the charred remains of individuals,'' said John Wiley Price, a Dallas County commissioner. ''They're going to have to use tissue and dental records to identify these people, and that could take three to four weeks.'' STORM AND CRISIS: TRAFFIC DEATHS"
"With an American city swamped by one great hurricane and then by another one less than a month later, with federal forecasters ticking down the annual list of 21 names for tropical storms at a record clip, it is no surprise that debate has flared over the role of global warming. After all, one of the clearest signals that human actions have pushed recent warming beyond natural cycles is a measured buildup of heat in the world's oceans, and oceanic heat is the fuel that powers hurricanes. The issue has been addressed from starkly different vantage points. For example, former Vice President Al Gore has conducted a continuing speaking tour on the need to cut heat-trapping pollution, while Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, has accused environmental campaigners of fomenting unfounded fears about human-driven warming. So what is the state of the science behind the arguments over the message sent by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina? What is clear is that an array of leading experts on oceans and climate agree that the tropical oceans have warmed in a way that is hard to attribute to anything other than overall warming of the climate from the buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions. It is also clear to many climate scientists and oceanographers that warmer oceans will eventually increase the intensity and rainfall of hurricanes, but not necessarily their frequency. In fact, two recent studies of hurricanes, by different scientists using different methods, claimed to detect a big rise in hurricane intensity around the world over the last several decades. But the authors of both analyses acknowledged that more data would be needed to confirm a link to human-caused warming. The murkiness arises because the relationship between long-term warming of the climate and seas is only perceptible in statistical studies of dozens of storms, not in the origin or fate of any particular storm. The growth and trajectory of any one storm is shaped by big natural vagaries in the atmosphere and oceans and chance occurrences, like the passage of both recent hurricanes over meandering eddies of unusually warm water in the Gulf of Mexico. ''It's a coincidence of ideal conditions,'' said Christopher W. Landsea, a hurricane expert at the Commerce Department's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory outside Miami. Kerry Emanuel, the author of one of the recent studies showing rising intensity, echoed many colleagues in saying that the impact of global warming was unlikely ever to be manifested in a black and white way that could serve as a call to arms for those seeking curbs on emissions. Instead, Dr. Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it would emerge as if someone had subtly, but progressively, loaded a pair of dice. STORM AND CRISIS: CLIMATE"
"Since Hurricane Katrina, New York City officials have assured residents that the city is prepared to handle the kind of evacuation that a major hurricane would require. The city has plans to move people from areas that are likely to flood, plans to open shelters and reception centers, and plans to use public transportation to carry them there. Most experts say the city's plans, if imperfect, are better thought out than those in other cities. They also say the city's mass transit network makes the plans for evacuating in advance of flooding or in the aftermath of isolated biological attacks more realistic than would be the case elsewhere. These experts say there is no question that city officials have spent considerable time and money envisioning situations and developing strategies for dealing with them. But Katrina and the scenes that unfolded as Hurricane Rita howled toward Texas raised a question: Would it be possible to carry out a complete evacuation of New York City? City officials do not pretend that it would be easy, or even doable. They say that very few situations would trigger such a necessity. Those situations are not hurricanes, but things like a nuclear event. But even the ''area evacuations'' they envision for hurricanes--evacuations of zones they have already designated as likely to be flooded--could involve huge traffic jams. Given how many bridges and tunnels the city has, the jams in Houston could seem mild. And they say that moving hospital or nursing home patients completely out of the city would be an epic challenge. Thus, after watching the disastrous, and in at least one instance deadly, backups in Houston, they have already tried to adjust their thinking about how to assist drivers who run out of gas. Yesterday, one official said, they worked out a plan to assign police escorts to gasoline trucks. Officials are acutely aware that talking about an all-out evacuation is talking about something unprecedented in scope. ''If New York City had to be evacuated, that would become a national event,'' said Joseph F. Bruno, the city's emergency management commissioner. ''The event would have to be so major, we'd call on federal assets almost immediately.'' Officials like Mr. Bruno and experts who have studied emergency preparedness say New York is unique among cities for the potential usefulness of its transportation system. Its subways, buses and commuter trains carry eight million commuters a day as is, and people could get to neighboring states more easily by New Jersey Transit and PATH trains than by driving. But Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky and others have raised questions about the city's evacuation planning. Mr. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, takes issue with the city's estimates of how many evacuees it could handle in a hurricane. He said that the city was prepared to handle a million evacuees and to provide shelter for 224,000 after a Category 4 hurricane. But he said that a 1993 Army Corps of Engineers study found that a less powerful Category 3 storm would create 2.5 million evacuees and the need to shelter as many as a million. Mr. Bruno, who did not comment on Mr. Brodsky's characterization of the city's plans, said yesterday that, based on Houston's experience with Rita, he believes that both estimates are low. ''We think more people will go'' in an evacuation, he said. ''We do think that the earlier assumptions, a blasé New York approach, won't be there in light of Katrina and Rita,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''People are going to act a little more frightened or be a little quicker to get out rather than say, 'I'm going to tough this out.' We saw too many images of that from New Orleans. The difference is New Orleans is below sea level and most of New York is not. We saw in Mississippi, which is not, that the land dried out quickly and people could get back. We'll be able to get people back.'' Other experts question whether hurricane evacuations could be as limited in scope as the city envisions. ''We can't rest on a limited scenario, which is the sort of hurricane plan we have, where you just evacuate parts of the city from one portion of the city to other portions of the city,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. He also questioned how hospitals would evacuate patients. ''To my knowledge, there are no plans that I would be comfortable with for evacuating major medical centers and nursing homes from the city,'' he said. ''No hospital with 500 patients, including people on ventilators, people in intensive care, can get all those people out of the city on its own, without major help from outside.'' Mr. Bruno said that the city's plan called for firefighters to go to hospitals and see what was needed. ''We have them all mapped,'' he said. ''If we see the possibility of an evacuation having to occur, the Fire Department will go out and communicate with each of them and say, 'What are your plans, how are you going to do it?''' Mr. Brodsky based his study on parts of the city's plan. He said he had repeatedly asked for a complete copy of the plan but that the city had refused to release all of it at once, saying it was always ''in flux.'' Officials have said that a Category 3 hurricane could bring a 25-foot storm surge in the financial district, southern Brooklyn and eastern Staten Island and at Kennedy Airport. The city's plan calls for opening 23 ''reception centers'' and hundreds of shelters, mainly in schools. Evacuees would go to a reception center and be assigned to a shelter. But city officials acknowledge that elements of an evacuation would have to be improvised. The city's emergency operations center has room for representatives of more than 90 federal, state and city agencies. City officials say they have invited officials from surrounding counties and New Jersey. In fact, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly says that the city has two general evacuation plans, one for hurricanes and another to be put into effect in the event of a terrorist attack or other catastrophe. The Police Department's role is a component of the overall plans, which have been prepared by Mr. Bruno's agency, the Office of Emergency Management. Commissioner Kelly, in an interview yesterday, said that the hurricane plan had different contingencies for different hurricane levels. Under the hurricane plan, he said, the emergency management agency coordinates the response and the Police Department has its ''core competencies'': assisting in the evacuation, overseeing security in evacuated areas, and attending to traffic control and search and rescue operations. The hurricane plan divides the city into three zones. Under the plan for an attack or other catastrophic event, the city would be divided into 151 sectors, each roughly equivalent in population and with some variation based on terrain and other particularities of individual neighborhoods. In coordination with other agencies, the city would use trains, boats and city buses to move people out of the city along preset routes. Mr. Kelly acknowledged that traffic, which sometimes seems to calcify during a normal commuter rush, would present a significant challenge. But he declined to characterize the plan as unthinkable, saying he believed the size of the problem the Police Department could field would prevent the kind of paralysis that seemed to strike Houston. Hanging over all this is the issue of how and when to inform the public, for no plan can succeed if residents are unaware of it. The city says it is prepared to spread the word , and that its efforts to do so include having Mr. Bruno appear on a Russian-language radio program (with a translator) to reach listeners in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.. But others, Mr. Brodsky included, say that most residents have no idea of where to go or what to do in an evacuation, which is exactly what crippled New Orleans."
"The waters returned to the Lower Ninth Ward on Friday, but this time, there was little left for them to destroy. Three and a half weeks earlier, Hurricane Katrina exploded homes or shoved them off their foundations and flipped cars on their backs like turtles. Finally, the neighborhood had been pumped dry. But on Friday, Hurricane Rita pushed the water back through a breach in a hastily repaired canal levee. By noon, three blocks from the breach, floodwaters had nearly reached the windows of homes that were already wrecked and abandoned. ''Nothing you can do about Mother Nature,'' Henry Rodriguez, the president of neighboring St. Bernard Parish, said in resignation as he watched from a bridge along Claiborne Avenue while water flooded anew into the impoverished area. For rescuers and the Army Corps of Engineers, there was no need for an urgent response to the topping of the levee as a storm surge pushed water from Lake Pontchartrain into the Industrial Canal. The Lower Ninth Ward was desolate. ''It's already destroyed,'' David Wheeler, operations chief for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's urban search and rescue teams, said from the Claiborne Avenue bridge. ''The good thing is that virtually all of New Orleans is empty. Hopefully, there is a minimal chance that anyone will be stranded.'' Mr. Wheeler's crews temporarily abandoned their mission because of safety threats posed by the new storm. ''We stayed as long as we could,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''It's time to go. We'll be back.'' By afternoon, two feet of water from the Lower Ninth Ward had flowed eastward into St. Bernard Parish, which was still without electricity but had at least been drying out. Mr. Rodriguez and other parish officials argued that the Corps of Engineers had not sufficiently repaired the Industrial Canal breach, and had not listened when told that the stone, crushed rock and clay dike was about to be overwhelmed. ''It's going to take two weeks to get all the water out,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''It's going to push back our recovery and re-entry effort. It concerns me that some of the resources used in our area are going to be taken away from our area for Rita. We're going to be second again.'' A second breach of an Industrial Canal levee also sent water into the previously flooded Upper Ninth Ward, an industrial and residential area where homes were already marked with the stains of Katrina. Plugs in levees weakened by Katrina at the 17th Street Canal and the London Avenue Canal were holding, the corps said, but rain and seepage along the repaired London Avenue Canal left water flowing several feet deep in some areas of the Gentilly and Mirabeau Gardens sections. Side streets became rivers again, rising to the door handles of abandoned cars. On Prentiss Avenue, water rolled in waves, floating beer cans and making shorelines of the debris piles that already covered lawns. A manhole cover marked ''Drain'' sat in the muck eight feet from the hole it was meant to cover. This new flooding blunted a nascent sense of renewal evident recently among city officials, and raised urgent questions about the need to improve the levee system here as New Orleans is rebuilt. ''Very depressing,'' Oliver Thomas Jr., the New Orleans City Council president, said in a radio interview. Moments of calm traded with moments of gusting, diagonal rains here on Friday. The skies were dark with pregnant clouds and low thunder sounded far in the distance. In the city center, the holdouts who had been gutting drywall or resting in lawn chairs on Canal Street a day before seemed to be gone by Friday morning. In their place, blowing debris made the once-cleared streets a slalom course of plastic chairs and buckets and tree limbs. A sign for David's Debris Removal was blown horizontal in the median. Uptown, on an eerily empty St. Charles Avenue, Neull Griffith, an oil supply boat captain, kept an eye on The Avenue Pub, owned by a friend. A generator hummed, and beer was being served, but Mr. Griffith said he wondered whether more rain from Rita would leave the bar too sodden to repair. ''The roof is leaking pretty bad,'' Mr. Griffith said as he sat on a chair at St. Charles and Polymnia Street, water pooling at the curb. ''I don't know if we can get the smell of rot out of the place. Everyone is in shock. But this is home. I don't belong no place else.'' STORM AND CRISIS: NEW ORLEANS"
"The cost of insurance for homes and businesses is expected to rise sharply in the Gulf Coast states because of Hurricane Katrina, and even more so with Hurricane Rita, industry experts said yesterday. Policyholders far from the battered coastline are also expected to face higher premiums. Prices for home insurance in New Orleans, elsewhere in Louisiana and in Mississippi could easily jump an average of 15 percent to 30 percent, industry executives and analysts said. In other states vulnerable to hurricanes, they said, the increase might be as little as 3 percent to 5 percent, with smaller rises in areas far from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Insurance for offices, factories and other businesses, which is less heavily regulated, is expected to rise even more than home insurance. ''It's going to be quite pronounced in the affected areas,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. Insurance companies themselves will have to pay significantly more for the coverage they buy from each other to spread their risk, coverage known as reinsurance, insurance executives said. That expense is expected to jump 10 percent to 20 percent, reversing a recent decline of more than 10 percent a year. The increase will be passed on to homeowners and businesses, a major reason premiums are expected to rise not only in areas of the United States far from the Gulf Coast but around the world as well. ''Think of this as throwing a rock into a lake and the next thing you have little waves going out in all directions,'' said Kevin Lampo, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Prices usually jump after a big hurricane as losses reduce the insurers' pool of capital and customers seek to maintain or increase coverage -- a classic example of supply-and-demand economics. The insurers say they do not literally raise their prices to recover losses. But, in a process that has the same effect, they factor in the new losses as a potential cost in the future and raise prices to give them enough money to pay those claims if they occur. ''We project out into the future what our loss costs are going to be and we do that with a new set of glasses,'' said Michael Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate, the nation's second-largest home and auto insurer behind State Farm. Even before Hurricane Rita, industry executives said the estimated losses from Katrina and two other weaker hurricanes had already made this year the most costly ever for natural disasters. Many insurance executives expect the industry's cost from Hurricane Katrina alone to be about $35 billion. One storm damage tracking firm, Risk Management Solutions, even calculates a cost of $40 billion to $60 billion. As Hurricane Rita moved toward Texas late yesterday, Mr. Hartwig estimated that damage might be $4 billion to $8 billion, down from perhaps $30 billion had the storm churned directly over Galveston and Houston with their heavy concentration of petrochemical plants and other businesses. One computer-generated estimate by Eqecat, a storm tracking company, put potential losses at as much as $18 billion, assuming the storm went ashore near Port Arthur, Tex., and the Louisiana border as a strong Category 3 or weak Category 4 hurricane. The previous industry record for natural disasters was a little more than $27 billion last year, when four powerful hurricanes hit Florida. The insurers paid about $35 billion in today's dollars for losses in the World Trade Center attacks. ''This is going to be the worst hurricane year in terms of costs, and we haven't even seen what Rita is going to do,'' said Karen M. Clark, the chief executive of AIR Worldwide, a Boston company that calculates hurricane damage. The insurers are hoping that the heavy losses will generate support in Washington for a program they have long sought that would provide them federal assistance in dealing with big natural disasters. They also hope the storms will increase support in Congress for renewal of the government program that promises to pay the majority of insurance losses in a terrorist attack, up to $100 billion. That terrorism program is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. The storm damage has driven down stock prices for many insurance companies, and industry executives say some smaller companies may be forced into bankruptcy. Nearly a dozen small insurers collapsed after Hurricane Andrew, which hit in 1992 and cost the industry about $23 billion in today's dollars. Andrew was the most expensive single hurricane until Katrina. The insurers may face an additional estimated $15 billion in costs if they are forced to pay for extensive flood damage from the storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama. Their policies specifically rule out responsibility for any kind of flood damage, the insurers say. Even so, both Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, and Richard Scruggs, a plaintiffs' lawyer who was prominent in the $246 billion settlement with the tobacco industry a few years ago, say they are determined to make the insurers pay. The Mississippi attorney general is seeking a temporary restraining order preventing the insurers from enforcing the flood exclusion in their policies, and Mr. Scruggs said he was preparing to file individual lawsuits on behalf of at least several hundred homeowners. ''This is a big issue for pricing,'' Ms. Clark said. ''If they are required to pay for flooding, when they reprice their policies, they're going to have to account for that peril, which they had not accounted for previously.'' The insurers' rationale for price increases for hurricane coverage is being reinforced by meteorologists' predictions that the United States is in for possibly a long period of unusually heavy storm assaults. When it turns out that the insurers have overestimated future costs, they are required to reduce their prices to reflect the more favorable experience with claims. That has been happening for home insurance customers over the last few years, especially in Texas, where many large claims for mold damage pushed prices up. The insurers' costs fell sharply after they succeeded in getting Texas and other states to permit them to end coverage for mold. After the four hurricanes swept Florida last year, insurers began pushing up prices for home insurance there by as much as 30 percent, with some homeowners hit with increases of more than 50 percent. For some in the most vulnerable areas, the price increases along the Gulf Coast could run even higher than in Florida, experts said. Even though insurance prices in Florida are among the highest in the country, they are being restrained by tough building codes, which reduce damage and risk for insurance companies, and a state fund that pays much of the losses in the worst hurricanes. None of the gulf states have these buffers. STORM AND CRISIS: THE COVERAGE"
"A county official in Georgia this week asked the Red Cross to leave a relief center for hurricane evacuees in suburban Atlanta, saying the organization's operations were chaotic and antiquated. The official, Vernon Jones, chief executive of DeKalb County, said that the Red Cross's tedious paper application process had resulted in long lines and that the group had made false promises of financial payments. Its failure to establish a process for distributing money disrupted other services provided at the relief center and forced the county to use its own resources to restore order, Mr. Jones said. ''It got so crazy that last Thursday, a riot nearly broke out because they had told people they would have checks for them and the checks weren't there,'' Mr. Jones said in a telephone interview. The county rented barriers to help maintain orderly lines, dispatched police officers and provided food and water to the crowds waiting for financial assistance, he said. ''They were issuing debit cards knowing that they wouldn't work just to get people out of line,'' Mr. Jones said. Bill Reynolds, a spokesman for the Red Cross's Metropolitan Atlanta Chapter, said the dispute with the county was over money. ''During the course of those negotiations, we were asked for some financial encumbrances that we considered an inappropriate use of the donated dollar,'' Mr. Reynolds said, declining to be more specific. Mr. Jones denied that, though he said he wished the county had an agreement with the Red Cross similar to those with other groups. ''Sure, we'd like to be a beneficiary of whatever resources they normally provide when they use a facility or services,'' he said. Hurricane Katrina challenged the Red Cross in a way that no other disaster had. At its peak, the organization had previously provided 280,000 meals in a single day, but a few days after the hurricane, it served 780,000 meals with its partner, the Southern Baptist Convention. The organization's leadership pleaded yesterday for more donations, noting that the $826 million it had received so far was less than half its estimated need of $2 billion. The organization prides itself on its 874,375 volunteers, who outnumber its paid staff by almost 25 to 1. But Mr. Jones questioned whether such an organization should be charged with first response in emergencies. ''Congress needs to evaluate whether or not we're going to use a nonprofit organization that's 90 percent volunteer driven to be responsible for managing and delivering relief during national disasters,'' he said. Jack B. Siegel, an expert in nonprofit law who runs a Web log called charitygovernance.com, framed the question differently. ''The Red Cross is filled with professionals, so this isn't really a ragtag 'volunteer' effort,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''The question to be asking is whether the Red Cross's professional staff is capable of properly focusing the activity of the volunteers. This is a management issue.'' About 14,000 of the Red Cross's disaster responders, some of whom are paid, have been deployed to serve as generals for the battalions of volunteers dispatched for Hurricane Katrina, leaving the organization with just 10,000 -- and Hurricane Rita may be a bigger storm. ''Disaster response is our bread and butter,'' said Devorah Goldburg, a spokeswoman for the national organization, ''and with 125 years of success in responding to all types of disasters, our organization has a proven track record.'' The dispute between the Red Cross's Atlanta chapter and DeKalb County, first reported in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, echoes criticism of the organization from coastal Mississippi and Louisiana. Mr. Jones said a sudden increase in the number of people seeking various services from county agencies led it to create a central relief center. The Red Cross had been considering the site in DeKalb County for its own disaster relief center but determined it had enough capacity at its three other locations in the Atlanta area. So the county took over the space, and representatives from county and state agencies, nonprofit groups, the post office and schools got involved. Some 25,000 people have used the center, Mr. Jones said. The Red Cross initially rejected the county's invitation to provide services there, but later set up shop for what proved to be four days. In that time, it provided financial assistance to 3,090 families, Mr. Reynolds said. He confirmed that the organization had problems with some debit cards and checks but said that was to be expected. ''There were a lot of people who wanted things immediately,'' Mr. Reynolds said, ''and in a disaster that's not always possible.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE AID AGENCY"
"At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, with Hurricane Rita gathering strength and aimed at Texas, Mayor Bill White of Houston ordered mandatory evacuations from low-lying sections of the city while urging voluntary evacuations from flood-prone neighborhoods and mobile homes. His pleas were entirely consistent with the region's established evacuation plans, plans that disaster officials had rehearsed and honed for years. Under those plans, 1.25million people, at most, were expected to leave. The big worry was whether enough people would heed evacuation orders. Instead, an estimated 2.5million people took flight, including tens of thousands who lived in relatively safe areas. What was planned as an orderly evacuation produced scenes of gridlock, chaos and mass frustration, with Mayor White warning of ''deathtrap'' highways. The danger, it turned out, was not that too few would listen, but that too many did. In interviews on Friday, state and local officials acknowledged a glaring flaw in their planning, the failure to account for the psychological effects of Hurricane Katrina, or what was instantly labeled ''the Katrina effect.'' ''We had a lot more people evacuated than should have evacuated,'' said Frank E. Gutierrez, emergency management coordinator of Harris County, which includes Houston. ''But because of Katrina, the damage that happened in Louisiana, a lot of people were scared.'' If anything, well-intentioned officials magnified the effect by repeatedly lacing evacuation pleas with reminders of the death toll and devastation in New Orleans. ''Don't follow the example of New Orleans,'' Mayor White pleaded on Wednesday. As a result, though, state and local disaster officials struggled with problems never envisioned in any evacuation plan, 100-mile-long traffic jams, dehydrated babies in stifling cars and hundreds of motorists who simply ran out of gasoline trying to flee on choked roads. In some cases, government improvised successfully. State employees, for example, delivered free gasoline to thousands of stranded motorists. The Houston bus system, with help from hundreds of volunteers, distributed 45,000 bottles of water to motorists. But there were also numerous examples of a sluggish response. After Mayor White ordered mandatory evacuations, it took nearly 22 hours for officials to order that all lanes of Interstate 45, the city's main evacuation route, be used for traffic leaving Houston. It took an additional five hours for state transportation officials to execute the order. In the case of U.S. 290, another major evacuation route, county officials said there were not enough law enforcement officials available to close feeder streets and safely manage one-way traffic. It remains to be seen whether the traffic problems contributed to the bus explosion outside Dallas early Friday morning that killed at least 24 elderly evacuees from an assisted-living center in Houston. The bus had taken more than 14 hours to make what is usually a five-hour trip. Judge Robert Eckels, the highest elected official in Harris County, defended the overall evacuation effort but acknowledged that officials did too little to prepare residents for huge traffic problems. ''The biggest flaw in this plan was communications,'' Judge Eckels said. ''They didn't understand what could happen. They could be 20 hours on the road. 'Don't get up here unless you have a full tank of gas.' We did not do a good enough job of telling people that you get on the road, it may take 20 hours.'' A spokesman for the State Transportation Department, Mike Cox, offered a different explanation for the preparations. No one could have predicted, Mr. Cox said, how many Texans would be so seriously frightened by Hurricane Katrina. ''Not one of our 15,000 employees is a psychologist,'' he said. In defending the response, Mr. Cox stressed the bottom line that despite nightmarish delays, millions of Texans made it to safety. ''This was, as best we can tell, probably the largest evacuation in American history,'' he said. Indeed, traffic problems eased noticeably throughout the state on Friday. Some motorists simply gave up, turned around and returned home. At the same time, state and local officials tried to tamp down the evacuation, emphasizing that residents should hunker down and ride out the storm if they lived on high ground. Just as Hurricane Katrina prompted a re-examination of planning in Louisiana and Mississippi, Hurricane Rita is likely to focus attention on planning here. Why didn't Texas plan for an evacuation of this magnitude? Greg Evans, a disaster planning expert who directs the Institute for BioSecurity at the St. Louis University School of Public Health, said state disaster officials too often failed to plan for the worst. ''People just like to believe things aren't going to be as bad as they are going to be,'' Dr. Evans said. ''Their plans assume that 1.5million people will evacuate when the reality is that 2.5million people are evacuating. ''All of a sudden, highways are jammed, people are running out of gas. All these things just spiral.'' In September 2004, Gov. Rick Perry ordered the state's Office of Homeland Security to evaluate evacuation plans. The review, delivered in March, identified weaknesses, particularly in the ''Houston-Galveston Evacuation Area.'' The weaknesses included evacuation routes not wide enough to ''handle large-scale movements of evacuees,'' routes that were too low and flood-prone, radio systems that cannot communicate with one another and inadequate monitoring of congestion. The report made 18 recommendations. State officials said few had put been put into effect. One recommendation was to install traffic counters on evacuation routes to monitor the heaviest traffic flows. Officials said they expected to have a plan for the counters by the end of the month. A spokesman for Mr. Perry did not respond to telephone messages for comment. ''There can always be a better plan,'' Judge Eckels said. ''The next time there will be a better plan.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE EVACUATION"
"Hurricane Rita began lashing coastal cities up and down Louisiana and Texas on Friday with hurricane-force winds, starting fires in Galveston and breaching levees again in New Orleans. Earlier in the day, a mass evacuation in Texas left at least 24 elderly passengers dead in a bus fire. As it approached the shore, the hurricane weakened to Category 3, with sustained winds of 120 miles an hour, down from a potentially catastrophic Category 5 on Wednesday. But the system was still bringing destruction. A storm surge of seven feet pushed water from Lake Pontchartrain through the Industrial Canal and over a repaired levee into the Lower Ninth Ward, one of New Orleans's most impoverished neighborhoods, which had been devastated nearly a month earlier by Hurricane Katrina and submerged under as much as 20 feet of water. The damage in New Orleans heightened fears over Hurricane Rita, which forced a chaotic exodus of more than two million residents from the Gulf Coast this week. Cities in southeast Texas braced as the storm winds grew to nearly 100 miles an hour around midnight. In Galveston late Friday, firefighters battled a blaze that burned at least three buildings on the edge of the downtown district. High winds also began shattering windows at the San Luis resort, where more than 200 first responders were prepared to stay throughout the night. Steve LeBlanc, the city manager, ordered everyone in the hotel to the second-floor conference room, considered the most secure area in the complex, in preparation for the heavy winds expected after midnight. In Beaumont, directly in the projected path of the storm, city and county officials, firefighters, paramedics and other workers camped out in the 17-story headquarters of Entergy, the power company, setting up cots among piles of clothes donated for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. As the hours passed, at least one glass door was shattered. Meteorologists said the hurricane's projected path had veered slightly to the east, with the storm potentially making landfall east of Houston and Galveston and closer to Port Arthur and Beaumont, two cities with large oil and chemical complexes. The possibility of damage to pipelines and refineries in Texas added to concern over the tumultuous depletion of gasoline supplies in parts of the state. ''Say a prayer for Texas,'' said Gov. Rick Perry, who described the storm as a ''great test.'' The earlier mass evacuations in Texas caused other problems. A bus carrying 38 nursing home residents and six employees from the Houston area caught fire and exploded Friday morning on a highway just south of Dallas, killing at least 24 passengers in the bus, said Don Peritz, a spokesman for the Dallas County Sheriff's Department. The storm also prompted preparations far from the region. Georgia announced that it would close all public schools on Monday and Tuesday to conserve fuel and help avoid the lines for gasoline that grew after Hurricane Katrina. Energy markets, frantic with the possibility that Hurricane Rita might wreak havoc on refineries and petrochemical plants, were relieved somewhat at the close of trading Friday when it appeared that the storm might veer from the largest complexes along the Gulf Coast. Oil prices fell $2.31 to $64.19 a barrel. In Washington, where the Bush administration had been criticized for its slow response to Hurricane Katrina, the president visited the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday. But he canceled a planned trip to Texas to avoid interfering with emergency preparations and planned to monitor the storm late Friday from the United States Northern Command in Colorado Springs. ''We're now facing another big storm,'' Mr. Bush said while at FEMA. ''Our job is to prepare for and assist state and local people to save lives and help these people get back on their feet.'' Federal officials declared a public health emergency for Texas and Louisiana. By evening it was the cities along the border of Texas and Louisiana that seemed to be in the storm's direct path. ''The core of Hurricane Rita will make landfall along the southwest Louisiana and upper Texas coasts near daybreak,'' the National Hurricane Center said. Communities were evacuated, and residents huddled in shelters. Port Arthur, normally a town of 60,000 protected by a seawall built to sustain a 16-foot storm surge, was vacant but for a few who refused to leave. Lake Charles, La., a city of about 72,000 just east of the Texas line, was also effectively empty, from the casino boats floating at the docks downtown to the rooms at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital, which evacuated 132 patients on Friday, most on planes departing from the former Chennault Air Force Base. And in San Augustine Park, 90 miles north of Beaumont, hundreds of people from southeast Texas set up camp in recreational vehicles and tents in the densely forested park run by the Army Corps of Engineers despite warnings of tornadoes, falling trees and rising lake waters. ''There aren't any hotels, and we couldn't get gas to go any farther north,'' said one camper, Dennis Cargill of Orangefield. In New Orleans, water also topped a levee on the other side of the Industrial Canal, sending it flowing into the Upper Ninth Ward, an industrial and residential area where homes were already marked with the stains of Hurricane Katrina. But officials said no additional loss of life or property was expected in these areas, previously pumped dry, that had been abandoned since the earlier storm. ''This is very dramatic, but I don't consider it an emergency situation,'' said Stephen Browning, a programs director for the Corps of Engineers, as he inspected the breaches from atop a nearby bridge. Still, the repeat flooding was disheartening for evacuated residents and for some local and state officials, dramatically pointing to the need to shore up the city's levee system in the rebuilding process. ''We have to think about building a safe New Orleans,'' Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said at a news conference in Baton Rouge, La. ''Our plans include building stronger and higher levees to protect all of the city's neighborhoods.'' By noon Friday, water had nearly reached the window level of some homes in the Lower Ninth Ward as far as three blocks from the topped levee between Claiborne and Florida Avenues. Early gusts from Hurricane Rita brought winds of 25 m.p.h. to 35 m.p.h. to New Orleans through Friday afternoon. Rain fell intermittently. Sometimes it drizzled; other times it blew sideways in stinging blasts. The Army Corps of Engineers said that levee repairs at the 17th Street Canal and the London Avenue Canal were holding and were expected to provide protection against storm surges as high as 10 to 12 feet. Metal pilings, rocks and sandbags were used to temporarily seal breaches made by Hurricane Katrina. But some seepage was expected, the corps said, and in the Gentilly and Mirabeau Gardens sections along the London Avenue Canal, water could be seen rising to the tops of tires of cars on some streets. Officials in St. Bernard Parish said it might take two weeks to pump out all the new water. In Texas, fuel shortages and the closing of airports in Houston added to problems for residents trying toflee from the storm. The Texas National Guard sent 5,000 trucks with gasoline to supply stranded vehicles along the highways leading out of Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur and Galveston. Coast Guard helicopters also transported fuel to 11 locations of the Texas Department of Transportation to assist in refueling the gasoline trucks. In Houston, commercial flights from the city's two main airports ceased operations at noon on Friday, with stranded passengers told to seek refuge in shelters around the city. As the skies darkened over Houston on Friday afternoon, the city grew eerily still, with the normally congested streets and highways empty of traffic. Although the hurricane looked like it would spare the city a direct hit, Mayor Bill White said at a news briefing, ''Winds of 50, 60 miles per hour may be better news than 120 miles per hour, but a lot of glass can be broken.'' He warned residents against going close to windows to observe the hurricane because the windows could blow out. ''There'll be plenty of time to watch on TV rather than get close to the window,'' Mr. White said. In the face of recriminations over the massive traffic tie-ups that clogged escape routes for hundreds of miles into Friday, the mayor said he took pride in the effort that had spirited about 2.5 million people out of harm's way. ''I hate traffic more than anybody I've ever met,'' Mr. White said, but he defended the turmoil as worthwhile in the end. The ghostly streets were a welcome sight on Friday, he said. ''That is exactly what we wanted to see at this time.'' With dozens of residents still in Galveston despite a mandatory evacuation, Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said the city had set up a shelter for about 100 residents at Alamo Elementary School. ''There are no doctors, no nurses, no triage,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''It's just a refuge, and I would like to make that clear.'' Less than a dozen people had shown up at the shelter by late Friday afternoon. Sitting on a cot as he cried, Miguel Rincon said he had terminal cancer and less than two years to live. He came to the school with his sister, Angelina Rincon, 63, and a brother, Raul Rincon, 73, who recently suffered from heat stroke. ''I'd rather be walking on the beach, anything instead of just possibly dying in the storm,'' said Miguel Rincon, 60, a retired road maintenance worker. ''I don't want to die.'' Mr. Rincon said his roommate took him and his siblings to the school after they heard about the center on television. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"GIVEN President Bush's final decision not to head to Texas in advance of Hurricane Rita, it's worth noting that American presidents have long found both political riches and peril at the scene of a storm. A listen to the tapes of President Lyndon B. Johnson's White House telephone conversations of 40 years ago reveals that history does indeed repeat itself, even if presidential reactions and motivations have varied widely. On the evening of Sept. 9, 1965, Hurricane Betsy, a Category 4 storm, roared into Louisiana with winds of up to 160 miles per hour. The next day, President Johnson followed coverage of the damage, watching the three television sets in the Oval Office and monitoring the news service wires clacking away inside the soundproof cabinet next to his desk. Then, at 2:36 in the afternoon, Senator Russell Long of Louisiana, son of the legendary Huey Long, called the president and urged him to come to New Orleans. Floodwaters had spilled over the levees, and three-quarters of New Orleans was under water. The senator opened with a geography lesson. ''Mr. President, aside from the Great Lakes, the biggest lake in America is Lake Pontchartrain,'' he said. ''It is now drained dry. That Hurricane Betsy picked up the lake and up and put it inside New Orleans and Jefferson Parish.'' Long said that his own house had been destroyed, but that his true concern was ''my people -- oh, they're in tough shape.'' Not fully convinced that his message had gotten through to his old friend and fellow Southerner, Long chose the most direct route to Johnson's famously weak heart: electoral politics. ''If you want to go to Louisiana right now -- you lost that state last year you could save yourself a campaign speech,'' the senator insisted. ''Just go there right now and say, 'My God, this is horrible! These federally constructed levees that Hale Boggs and Russell Long built is the only thing that saved 5,000 lives!''' Johnson replied that he had a ''hell of a two days'' ahead on his schedule, so Long went in for the kill: ''If you go there right now, Mr. President, they couldn't beat you if Eisenhower ran!'' Minutes later, Johnson had his staff make arrangements for a trip to New Orleans. He explained in a phone call to his director of emergency planning, Buford Ellington, that the people of Louisiana ''feel like nobody cares about them, and they voted against us, and they feel like they're kind of on the outside.'' Johnson added, ''I feel about them like a 17-year-old girl; I want them to know they're loved.'' At 5:18 p.m., Air Force One took off from Andrews Air Force Base. Approaching New Orleans, the 707 made a low pass over the city. On board, the delegation included Senator Long and Representative Hale Boggs, who described the damage over the aircraft's public address system. After landing, with a 25 m.p.h. wind still blowing and no power for the loudspeakers that had been set up, Johnson was forced to shout his arrival statement. His words nonetheless bordered on the poetic: ''I am here because I wanted to see with my own eyes what the unhappy alliance of wind and water have done to this land and its people.'' The presidential motorcade drove down Canal Street, broken store windows lining both sides, and made several stops. Johnson spoke with bystanders and toured a shelter packed with storm victims. An aide wrote, ''Most of the people inside and outside of the building were Negro the people all about were bedraggled and homeless thirsty and hungry.'' At one point, a woman rushed up to the president to tell him that both of her sons had drowned. The next day's New York Times reported, ''according to Bill D. Moyers, the presidential press secretary, Mr. Johnson was 'almost overcome.''' He watched the stream of evacuees who had been rescued by boat from the rooftops of their houses and were now on foot, carrying whatever possessions were left. When another woman asked the president for drinking water, Johnson dispatched a Secret Service agent to make sure it was delivered. An entry in the White House travel diary paints a grim picture: ''Calls of 'water -- water -- water' were resounded over and over again in terribly emotional wails from voices of all ages.'' The president suggested that local soft drink bottlers (in an era before bottled water was an American staple) make their inventory available. Seventy-five people died in the storm, most of them in the city. Hurricane Betsy caused $1.4 billion in damage. Lingering bad weather made a planned flight to Baton Rouge impossible. At 8:29 p.m., a little over 24 hours after the eye of the storm came ashore, Air Force One lifted off from New Orleans. En route home, the president of the United States retired to his stateroom on the plane, changed into pajamas and went to bed. Senator Russell Long was not on that flight back to Washington. He had stayed in New Orleans. The scion of Louisiana political royalty had lost his home to the storm, but had delivered the ultimate prize to his people: a visit by the president, and a promise of federal aid to build up the levees surrounding his beloved city.

"Three weeks after the nation was shocked to realize how little the government knew about emergency management in New Orleans, another hurricane has hit the South and made it clear that the learning curve is still daunting. There was little danger that Rita would fail to get the authorities' full attention, or that people in the potential path of danger would not heed warnings to evacuate. But when Houston residents were told to leave, they found themselves stranded and sweltering in 90-degree heat in colossal traffic jams. High-occupancy-vehicle lanes went unused, as did many inbound lanes of highways, because authorities inexplicably waited until late Thursday to open some up. Some motorists discovered, in terror, that they were stuck in what could be the hurricane's path. Tragically, one bus carrying 45 people -- 38 of them elderly nursing home residents -- caught fire near Dallas, killing at least 24. If Katrina exposed what happens when many people have no cars to escape danger, Rita seemed to show the other side of the coin. The authorities are going to have to become much more sophisticated about developing evacuation plans that do not put every family on the highway in its own vehicle. But the car-obsessed American public is going to require a lot of education before many will accept the idea that they should flee disaster via mass transit. Some Rita-related failures seemed inexplicable. A dearth of federal security screeners at Houston's airports led to long lines for the airline passengers trying get out of the city. The Homeland Security Department should have anticipated that problem. Houston's shortage of emergency shelters and the local officials' apparent reluctance to let the public know where space was available were hard to comprehend. President Bush was as visible in the preparations for Rita's arrival as he had been absent during Katrina. He had even planned to meet a search-and-rescue team in San Antonio yesterday, but the team was moving elsewhere so that stop was canceled. The president well knows that his presence can be more of a distraction than a comfort when he's on the scene in these circumstances. What the country wants is confidence that the administration is improving the leadership and performance of FEMA, and homeland security operations in general. We already know that the White House knows how to manage a good photo-op. Editorial"
"A few residents returning to their homes in this devastated region have found the bodies of their loved ones, even in houses that have been searched and marked, and the state emergency medical director warned Wednesday that more families could be in for a similar shock. Dr. Louis Cataldie, the medical director for emergency response, made his remarks after a news conference about the effort to retrieve and identify bodies, saying he had arranged for a rapid response if families called 911. Four bodies were found on Wednesday in St. Bernard Parish, just east of New Orleans. ''I'm very concerned about people going back to their homes,'' Dr. Cataldie said. The statement came just before Mayor C. Ray Nagin laid out plans to open most of New Orleans to residents over the next week, an effort that had been stalled by Hurricane Rita. Speaking to state legislators at the Capitol, Mayor Nagin said residents would be allowed to return to all neighborhoods except the Lower Ninth Ward, which he said was still flooded. They will be allowed to inspect their property or, if they wanted, to stay in the city, he said, according to The Associated Press. Mayor Nagin's effort to repopulate New Orleans, which still lacks basic services in many areas, was seemingly unshaken by the resignation of the city's police superintendent, Edwin P. Compass III, on Tuesday. Superintendent Compass said in an interview on Wednesday that he decided to resign at the urging of the mayor in a Tuesday morning meeting. Mayor Nagin has been under tremendous pressure from New Orleanians who have watched neighboring parishes like St. Bernard reopen in recent days, even though the experience has been painful. Many families took along empty trailers for salvaged belongings, but left with only a bag or two of possessions, the rest having been ruined. Officials said it was inevitable that a few returning residents would face not only the trauma of seeing their homes and possessions destroyed, but also the body of a family member. Although search-and-rescue teams from various law enforcement agencies have done grid searches, they have entered homes only if there was reason to believe that they might find a living person or human remains, Dr. Cataldie said. Dr. Bryan Bertucci, the coroner in St. Bernard Parish, which was opened to residents on Saturday, said that even in houses that had been entered, conditions might have prevented a thorough search. ''I've been in my own house five times, and I still can't get into the bathroom,'' Dr. Bertucci said. In many rooms at St. Rita's Nursing Home, where 34 died, he said, ''if you looked in the room numerous times, you wouldn't know somebody was there unless you moved furniture around.'' Dr. Bertucci said that three of the four bodies found on Wednesday had been discovered by families or friends. In the fourth case, the family was on the way home but called ahead to report that they had not heard from one relative. Kenyon Worldwide Disaster Management, which has been contracted to retrieve bodies, was able to find and remove the body before the family arrived. ''All of us felt that this would be the worst scenario that could happen, and it is happening,'' Dr. Bertucci said. ''People are coming back to find their loved ones.'' The death toll from Hurricane Katrina now stands at 1,134 in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Georgia. Houston has recorded 46 deaths among evacuees. Dr. Cataldie said that of the 783 bodies taken to the temporary central morgue, 32 have been released to families. Dr. Cataldie said about 340 others had been presumptively identified but would not be released until they were positively identified through DNA, dental records or fingerprints. Families are typically notified when a presumptive identification is made, he said. Other bodies have not been released because they are awaiting autopsy, he said. Many of those identified have been from nursing homes or hospitals. More than 100 autopsies have been performed, Dr. Cataldie said, the bulk of them on bodies found in those institutions. The state attorney general is investigating those deaths and has charged the operators of St. Rita's with negligent homicide. People who appear to have been the victims of violence will also have autopsies, Dr. Cataldie said. Only six or seven have appeared to be homicide victims, he said. Dr. Cataldie acknowledged that the process was painfully slow for families waiting to say their last goodbyes. ''Yes, it's horrible,'' he said. ''These are horrible times, and it's extremely frustrating.'' Mayor Nagin has also been frustrated in his effort to reopen New Orleans to businesses and residents. Businesses will be allowed to return on Thursday and residents beginning on Friday, with the primary exception being flooded areas in the Ninth Ward, under the plan announced Wednesday. A day earlier, Mayor Nagin had asked his police chief to consider stepping down, the chief said in a phone interview. Superintendent Compass said now that he had guided the New Orleans police past the chaos of Hurricane Katrina, perhaps others could do better as New Orleans began to rebuild. ''The mayor said that I did a great job for the city, but that every leader has to understand when they have to leave,'' Superintendent Compass said, referring to his 26 years as a police officer and three years as chief. He said that Mayor Nagin told him: ''I'm not forcing you to retire, but you've got to think of the big picture. Are you the best man to run the department? Do you have the energy to keep up with the pace you've been going?'' The mayor noted that the police chief's wife, Arlene, is expected to give birth in two weeks, the superintendent said. Superintendent Compass sounded philosophical, not bitter, and described his relationship with the mayor as professional, not adversarial. ''He didn't pressure me,'' the chief said. Superintendent Compass said he had spoken to publishers in New York this month at the request of a friend and with the intent of giving most of the money from any book deal to the local police foundation for displaced officers. No deal had been signed, he said. ''I'm not going to take advantage of this to make money,'' Superintendent Compass said. ''God has given me everything that I need. I didn't resign to write a book or make a movie. My life is police work.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE DEAD"
"How it started, no one is exactly sure. Tracy Velazquez says she bolted awake in the middle of the night during the Labor Day weekend with a thought: Why not give back Bozeman's share of the federal money that some have derided as pork in the recently signed $286 billion transportation bill, and use it to help rebuild the ruins left by Hurricane Katrina? The money, by the standards of the $62 billion already appropriated for hurricane measures, is small change -- $4 million for a parking garage. To some fellow Bozemanites, the proposal was a pipe dream. Nobody gives back money to the government. But there was life to the idea. About the same time, some people in Alaska suggested doing the same thing with their share of the transportation bill, particularly $223 million to build a bridge from the city of Ketchikan to an island with barely 50 people. They started a Web site, americagivesback.org; held rallies; and waved around a symbolic check for hurricane relief in place of ''two bridges to nowhere,'' a reference to two bridges for which Alaska received about a half-billion dollars in the spending bill. The Heritage Foundation, which has long served as an intellectual font for influential Republicans, and its philosophical cousin, the libertarian magazine Reason Online, took up the same cry. In Washington, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said all $25 billion in special projects -- called earmarks -- from the transportation bill could be deferred. House Republicans and some Democrats, like Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, said a similar thing. The echo hit Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, chairman of the committee that guided the highway bill through Congress and a record amount of money to his state. ''They can kiss my ear!'' Mr. Young told a reporter from The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, when asked about the proposal of returning federal money. ''That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard,'' he added. Predictable as the go-round was in Washington, the thought of giving government money back has stirred civic souls in a place where the politics of federal budgeting rarely cause such a fuss. And it has taken some of the abstraction out of numbers that seldom prompt Monday night debates over lives versus parking lots. It has been the talk of Main Street in Bozeman, judging by conversations with merchants in this pleasant college town of 35,000. ''I don't think you ever want to give back money once it's given to you by the federal government for infrastructure,'' said Bobbie Wells, a Bozeman resident who was out on her noon power walk. Tom Day, who runs a downtown smoke shop and newsstand, called the idea a worthy proposal, though he had little confidence that Bozeman could start something that would generate a wave of altruism all the way to Washington. ''It's hard to imagine in this cynical political climate,'' Mr. Day said. ''But still, as unlikely as it is, it has people talking. Do we really need a $4million parking garage when all those people are suffering from the hurricane?'' Ms. Velazquez said those were her very thoughts when she floated the idea. ''I wouldn't say a parking garage wouldn't be nice,'' said Ms. Velazquez, who ran for Congress as a Democrat last year and lost to Representative Denny Rehberg by almost two to one. ''It would be nice. But we're doing O.K. without it.'' She suggested that ''every city in America look at what they can postpone or do without for now.'' The idea was that money in the transportation bill for things like a Packard museum in Warren, Ohio; a garage at a private university in Tennessee; and horse trails in High Knob, Va., among other things, could be better spent on people who had lost everything in what may be the nation's worst natural disaster. After Ms. Velazquez promoted the idea in The Chronicle and in a blog, the reaction was swift and large, and it surprised her. ''People called me naïve and things like that, but you know what, nobody laughed at me,'' Ms. Velazquez said. ''This is Montana. If I had come out with something contentious about snowmobiles or wolves, then I'd be facing some trouble. But a parking garage? No.'' On Monday, the City of Bozeman took up the proposal, and following the advice of City Manager Chris Kukulski, concluded that it would be impossible to give back federal money once it has been given away. After a lively debate, the City Commission voted unanimously to keep the $4 million. ''We can't accept the check and then endorse it to the City of New Orleans for hurricane relief,'' Mr. Kukulski said in an interview. ''It just can't be done.'' Ronald Utt, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who has been promoting the giveback idea all month, said that a narrow technical reading of federal law would make it hard to return money to the treasury for another purpose -- but that it could be done. ''If, when the $4 million check came to Bozeman and they tried to give it to New Orleans for hurricane relief, they would probably be arrested,'' Mr. Utt said. ''Bozeman can't do this. But Congress can. This money came from a 1,200-page bill that nobody read. You can pull bits and pieces from it. You can unravel the formula.'' Mr. Kukulski said that Bozeman's conscience was clean because hurricane donations from its citizens had been ample and that the city had sent two of its firefighters to help with the relief effort. ''I think most people appreciate the notion that we started something,'' he said. City leaders say they need the parking garage to attract a new performing arts center and for shoppers downtown. Parking at midday on Wednesday was a breeze, with two hours of free time allotted on and around Main Street. Bozeman Journal"
"Everyone who stayed for Hurricane Katrina has a story, and Johnny Fleming's story begins in a bar. That is not particularly odd in Gulfport. Bible Belt Mississippi, local residents will tell you, stops at Interstate 10. ''When people come down here to the coast, they let their hair hang down,'' said Mr. Fleming, an animated man who often breaks into laughter midsentence. The Tiffin Room Lounge is where he celebrated his 50th birthday and where his father celebrated his. It is where Mr. Fleming, now 53, kept watch during Hurricanes Ivan last year and Georges in 1998, and where he and the bar's owner, Jan Carter, brought a mattress and filled the beer coolers to ride out Katrina. The morning of the storm, the bayou across the street had left its banks and was lapping into the parking lot. An hour or two later, it was seeping in the front door. An hour after that, it was rising up to the pool table, where Ms. Carter was napping. ''I said, 'Jan, you better wake up,''' Mr. Fleming recalled. '''We're fixing to have to make a move.''' Soon the door and the windows burst open, and in came the Gulf of Mexico. The cigarette machine and the jukebox started dancing in the waves, and the bar stools bounced in single file to the back of the bar, ''like they was doing the locomotion,'' Mr. Fleming said. Lying on the mattress, Mr. Fleming and Ms. Carter paddled out the window and over to a nearby golf course, where they stayed until the waters receded. ''We were going from green to green,'' Mr. Fleming explained, '''cause I know the greens are higher ground.'' Then, exhausted, he and Ms. Carter walked to a friend's house several miles away. The Tiffin Room Lounge is now little more than an empty carcass, but Mr. Fleming insists it will be rebuilt, if only for the sake of Ms. Carter, who has not been the same since the storm. Mr. Fleming was terribly sick himself for a few days afterward. But ''I knew I wasn't going to die,'' he said. ''I owe too much money.'' CAMPBELL ROBERTSON STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"After the storm came the siege. In the days after Hurricane Katrina, terror from crimes seen and unseen, real and rumored, gripped New Orleans. The fears changed troop deployments, delayed medical evacuations, drove police officers to quit, grounded helicopters. Edwin P. Compass III, the police superintendent, said that tourists -- the core of the city's economy -- were being robbed and raped on streets that had slid into anarchy. The mass misery in the city's two unlit and uncooled primary shelters, the convention center and the Superdome, was compounded, officials said, by gangs that were raping women and children. A month later, a review of the available evidence now shows that some, though not all, of the most alarming stories that coursed through the city appear to be little more than figments of frightened imaginations, the product of chaotic circumstances that included no reliable communications, and perhaps the residue of the longstanding raw relations between some police officers and members of the public. Beyond doubt, the sense of menace had been ignited by genuine disorder and violence that week. Looting began at the moment the storm passed over New Orleans, and it ranged from base thievery to foraging for the necessities of life. Police officers said shots were fired for at least two nights at a police station on the edge of the French Quarter. The manager of a hotel on Bourbon Street said he saw people running through the streets with guns. At least one person was killed by a gunshot at the convention center, and a second at the Superdome. A police officer was shot in Algiers during a confrontation with a looter. It is still impossible to say if the city experienced a wave of murder because autopsies have been performed on slightly more than 10 percent of the 885 dead. [On Wednesday, however, Dr. Louis Cataldie, the state's medical incident commander for Hurricane Katrina victims, said that only six or seven deaths appear to have been the result of homicides. He also said that people returning to homes in the damaged region have begun finding the bodies of relatives. [Superintendent Compass, one of the few seemingly authoritative sources during the days after the storm, resigned Tuesday for reasons that remain unclear. His departure came just as he was coming under criticism from The New Orleans Times-Picayune, which had questioned many of his public accounts of extreme violence.] In an interview last week with The New York Times, Superintendent Compass said that some of his most shocking statements turned out to be untrue. Asked about reports of rapes and murders, he said: ''We have no official reports to document any murder. Not one official report of rape or sexual assault.'' On Sept. 4, however, he was quoted in The Times about conditions at the convention center, saying: ''The tourists are walking around there, and as soon as these individuals see them, they're being preyed upon. They are beating, they are raping them in the streets.'' Those comments, Superintendent Compass now says, were based on secondhand reports. The tourists ''were walking with their suitcases, and they would have their clothes and things taken,'' he said last week. ''No rapes that we can quantify.'' Rumors Affected Response A full chronicle of the week's crimes, actual and reported, may never be possible because so many basic functions of government ceased early in the week, including most public safety record-keeping. The city's 911 operators left their phones when water began to rise around their building. To assemble a picture of crime, both real and perceived, The New York Times interviewed dozens of evacuees in four cities, police officers, medical workers and city officials. Though many provided concrete, firsthand accounts, others passed along secondhand information or rumor that after multiple tellings had ossified into what became accepted as fact. What became clear is that the rumor of crime, as much as the reality of the public disorder, often played a powerful role in the emergency response. A team of paramedics was barred from entering Slidell, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, for nearly 10 hours based on a state trooper's report that a mob of armed, marauding people had commandeered boats. It turned out to be two men escaping from their flooded streets, said Farol Champlin, a paramedic with the Acadian Ambulance Company. On another occasion, the company's ambulances were locked down after word came that a firehouse in Covington had been looted by armed robbers of all its water -- a report that proved totally untrue, said Aaron Labatt, another paramedic. A contingent of National Guard troops was sent to rescue a St. Bernard Parish deputy sheriff who radioed for help, saying he was pinned down by a sniper. Accompanied by a SWAT team, the troops surrounded the area. The shots turned out to be the relief valve on a gas tank that popped open every few minutes, said Maj. Gen. Ron Mason of the 35th Infantry Division of the Kansas National Guard. ''It's part of human nature,'' General Mason said. ''When you get one or two reports, it echoes around the community.'' Faced with reports that 400 to 500 armed looters were advancing on the town of Westwego, two police officers quit on the spot. The looters never appeared, said the Westwego police chief, Dwayne Munch. ''Rumors could tear down an entire army,'' Chief Munch said. During six days when the Superdome was used as a shelter, the head of the New Orleans Police Department's sex crimes unit, Lt. David Benelli, said he and his officers lived inside the dome and ran down every rumor of rape or atrocity. In the end, they made two arrests for attempted sexual assault, and concluded that the other attacks had not happened. ''I think it was urban myth,'' said Lieutenant Benelli, who also heads the police union. ''Any time you put 25,000 people under one roof, with no running water, no electricity and no information, stories get told.'' Crimes of Opportunity The actual, serious crime began, in the recollection of many, before the catastrophic failure of the levees flooded the city, and much of it consisted of crimes of opportunity rather than assault. On the morning of Monday, Aug. 29, in the half hour or so that the eye of Hurricane Katrina fell on the city -- an illusory moment of drawn breath, sunshine and fair breezes -- the looters struck, said Capt. Anthony W. Canatella, the police commander in the Sixth District. Using a chain hitched to a car, they tore open the steel doors at the back of a pawn shop called Cash America on Claiborne Avenue. ''Payday Advances to 350,'' read a sign where the marquee would have been. ''There was nothing in there you could sustain your life with,'' Captain Canatella said. ''There's nothing in there but guns and power tools.'' The Sixth District -- like most of New Orleans, a checkerboard of wealth and poverty -- was the scene of heavy looting, with much of the stealing confined to the lower-income neighborhoods. A particular target was a Wal-Mart store on Tchoupitoulas Street, bordering the city's elegant Garden District and built on the site of a housing project that had been torn down. The looters told a reporter from The Times that they followed police officers into the store after they broke it open, and police commanders said their officers had been given permission to take what they needed from the store to survive. A reporter from The Times-Picayune said he saw police officers grabbing DVD's. A frenzy of stealing began, and the fruits of it could be seen last week in three containers parked outside the Sixth District police station. Inside were goods recovered from stashes placed by looters in homes throughout the neighborhood, said Captain Canatella, most but not all still bearing Wal-Mart stickers. ''Not one piece of educational material was taken -- the best-selling books are all sitting right where they were left,'' Captain Canatella said. ''But every $9 watch in the store is gone.'' One of the officers who went to the Wal-Mart said the police did not try to stop people from taking food and water. ''People sitting outside the Wal-Mart with groceries waiting for a ride, I just let them sit there,'' said Sgt. Dan Anderson of the Sixth District. ''If they had electronics, I just threw it back in there.'' Three auto parts stores were also looted. In a house on Clara Street, Sergeant Anderson picked his way through a soggy living room, where car parts, still in their boxes, were strewn about. On the wall above a couch, someone had written ''Looters'' with spray paint. ''The nation's realizing what kind of criminals we have here,'' Sergeant Anderson said. Among the evacuees, there was gratitude for efforts by the police and others to help them get out of town, but it was clear that some members of the public did not have a high opinion of the New Orleans Police Department, with numerous people citing cases of corruption and violence a decade ago. ''Don't get me wrong, there was bad stuff going on in the streets, but the police is dirty,'' said Michael Young, who had worked as a waiter in the Riverwalk development. French Quarter Is Spared As the storm winds died down that Monday, small groups that had evacuated from poor neighborhoods as far away as the Lower Ninth Ward passed through the historic French Quarter, heading for shelter at the convention center. ''Some were pushing little carts with their belongings and holding onto their kids,'' said Capt. Kevin B. Anderson, the French Quarter's police commander. He said his officers gave food, water and rides. ''That also served another purpose,'' he said. ''That when they came through, they didn't cause any problems.'' The jewelry and antique shops in the French Quarter were basically left untouched, though squatters moved into a few of the hotels. Only a small grocery store and drugstores at the edge of the quarter were hit by looters, he said. From behind the locked doors of the Royal Sonesta hotel on Bourbon Street, Hans Wandfluh, the general manager, said he had watched passers-by who seemed to be up to no good. ''We heard gunshots fired,'' Mr. Wandfluh said. ''We saw people running with guns.'' At dusk on Aug. 29, looters broke windows along Canal Street and swarmed into drugstores, shoe stores and electronics shops, Captain Anderson said. Some tried, without success, to break into banks, and others sought to take money from A.T.M.'s. The convention center, without water, air-conditioning, light or any authority figures, was recalled by many as a place of great suffering. Many heard rumors of crime, and saw sinister behavior, but few had firsthand knowledge of violence, which they often said they believed had taken place in another part of the half-mile-long center. ''I saw Coke machines being torn up -- each and every one of them was busted on the second floor,'' said Percy McCormick, a security guard who spent four nights in the convention center and was interviewed in Austin, Tex. Capt. Jeffrey Winn, the commander of the SWAT team, said its members rushed into the convention center to chase muzzle flashes from weapons to root out groups of men who had taken over some of the halls. No guns were recovered. State officials have said that 10 people died at the Superdome and 24 died around the convention center -- 4 inside and 20 nearby. While autopsies have not been completed, so far only one person appears to have died from gunshot wounds at each facility. In another incident, Captain Winn and Lt. Dwayne Scheuermann, the assistant SWAT commander, said they both shot and wounded a man brandishing a gun near people who had taken refuge on an Interstate highway. Captain Winn said the SWAT team also exchanged gunfire with looters on Tchoupitoulas Street. The violence that seemed hardest to explain were the reports of shots being fired at rescue and repair workers, including police officers and firefighters, construction and utility workers. Cellphone repair workers had to abandon work after shots from the Fischer housing project in Algiers, Captain Winn said. His team swept the area three times. On one sweep, federal agents found an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle, Captain Winn said. For military officials, who flew rescue missions around the city, the reports that people were shooting at helicopters turned out to be mistaken. ''We investigated one incident and it turned out to have been shooting on the ground, not at the helicopter,'' said Maj. Mike Young of the Air Force. STORM AND CRISIS: LAWLESSNESS"
"Rafael Lara had been creeping along Interstate 10 for only four hours, an eyeblink compared with the 12 or more hours some had been struggling to flee Hurricane Rita. ''I'd feel a lot better about that,'' Mr. Lara, 30, a Houston firefighter, said Thursday, ''except we're still only four miles from our house.'' Tony Gilmore hung one foot from the passenger window of a fully laden Volkswagen, snapping his flip-flop to the beat of Bruce Springsteen and looking ahead at the endless line of unmoving vehicles. ''I guess this is what they mean by the calm before the storm,'' he said. Calm was in increasingly short supply as afternoon drifted into evening in the nation's fourth-largest city, which had become a weird amalgam of nearly empty streets and traffic-choked freeways, shuttered luxury malls and bustling beer joints, skies as pristine as a Hill Country lake alongside dire warnings of nature's terrible wrath, approaching from the southeast about 12 miles an hour. City buses rolled through the deserted downtown, most of them empty, just a driver pulling a double-size, articulated cocoon of cooled air along a canyon of dark skyscrapers. A mile or so to the southeast, though, in the heart of the Third Ward, one of the city's predominantly black neighborhoods, the crowd was thick outside Cream Burgers, a fragrant food shack. ''See that gas station across the street?'' said Derek Dunn, who moved to the Third Ward four years ago. ''It was $2.59 a gallon when I drove by here early this morning. At 2 o'clock, it was $2.79 and now what is it, almost 4 o'clock? It's up to $2.89.'' The drill at Cream Burger is that you order through a mesh screen window -- ''Speak Louder,'' a hand-scrawled sign says -- and then wait at one of the round metal tables for the burgers to arrive. All the talk Thursday, of course, was about Hurricane Rita. And in Houston, residents talk knowingly about flood plains and wild weather patterns. ''It's not going to flood here, no way,'' said Sue Walker, chewing vigorously on a cheeseburger. ''We know where it floods around here.'' Mr. Dunn pointed to the south. ''Sims Bayou,'' he said. Ms. Walker said, ''That's right, down by Sims Bayou.'' She added: ''That's south of here. Now, if I lived on Sims Bayou, I'd be gone. But most of these neighborhoods are going to be just fine. We survived Hurricane Alicia in 1983, we got through Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, we'll get through this.'' None of the dozen people waiting outside Cream Burger intended to leave the city. ''I mean, really, where are you going to go, anyway?'' said John Hudgins, who has lived in Houston since 1972. ''The highways are full, in every direction. You might as well just stick around. With luck, all you'll lose is some shingles on your house.'' Eddie Perez, a grocery store manager stuck on I-10 with his wife, children and dog, said he did not want to take a chance, not after Hurricane Katrina. And even though he had moved only about a half-mile in the last hour, Mr. Perez said he was optimistic. ''It could be a lot worse,'' he said. ''I hope it won't be.'' Michael Marchand, an offshore oil-rig worker, sat at the outdoor bar at the West Alabama Ice House late Thursday afternoon, putting away a string of Budweiser longnecks. He looked incredulous when asked if he intended to flee. ''To go where?'' Mr. Marchand said. ''Have you been watching the highways on television?'' Still, he said, he will probably stick close to home when Hurricane Rita hits rather than wandering over to the Ice House, his habit in previous storms (''They always stay open''). This storm did not look like one to mess with, he said. In the parking lot beneath the Pierce Elevated, the freeway that marks the southern edge of downtown, about a dozen homeless men were still living in nests of cardboard and rags. ''I'm going to try to stay here, I guess, and hope I don't get drowned,'' said Ronald Antoine, 33, who fled from New Orleans to escape Hurricane Katrina. ''The way I figure, there will be rain and wind anywhere you go.'' O.C. Gray, 60, was seated a few yards away, cradling his forehead in long, gnarled fingers. ''We sure could use some water to drink,'' he said. ''But I figure, I'm old, I'm ready to die. I'm just ready for whatever this storm does.'' A dozen miles to the west, on the main highway to San Antonio, a narrow gap opened up in front of Mr. Lara, who slowly inched his S.U.V. forward two yards, three, five, then a full stop. He shook his head. ''Seems to me like they could have done a little better with this evacuation, doesn't it?'' he said. ''It's not like they didn't have any warning.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE EXODUS"
"Under intense pressure to show that he has learned the practical and political lessons of Hurricane Katrina, President Bush planned on Thursday to pack his foul-weather gear and head to Texas on Friday ahead of Hurricane Rita, trying to make clear that he is directing an all-out federal effort to cope with the storm. Mr. Bush, who was photographed strumming a guitar in San Diego on the morning that New Orleans was being flooded 23 days ago, appeared intent on ensuring there would be no off-message pictures this time and no question of where his attention was focused. ''Officials at every level of government are preparing for the worst,'' Mr. Bush said Thursday morning, adding that the officials were working together ''to respond swiftly and effectively.'' Until now, Mr. Bush has stayed away from disaster zones until the worst is past, out of concern that his presence would be a distraction. But after criticism for a less than hands-on approach immediately after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana coasts, Mr. Bush planned a Texas stop to look at preparations before the forecast arrival of the hurricane early Saturday. He then intends to fly to Colorado Springs, the White House said, to ride out the storm at the headquarters of the Northern Command. Mr. Bush can monitor the hurricane from the Northern Command's operations center, where oversight of the military response to crises in the United States is managed. It is at an airfield just across town from Cheyenne Mountain, where the military once monitored the Soviet Union for nuclear missile launching. Asked whether Mr. Bush's pre-hurricane advance work in Texas was anything more than a photo-op, the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, said the president ''wants to go and be able to see some of the preparations that are under way'' and thank police, fire, medical and other emergency personnel who are assembling to work on the storm. ''He is the president, and as he indicated to you all, it is his responsibility when it comes to the federal government's role in these hurricanes,'' Mr. McClellan told reporters, alluding to Mr. Bush's statement last week that he had ultimate responsibility for any federal failures involving Hurricane Katrina. In briefings, the White House, the Homeland Security Department and other agencies said the federal government was acting on multiple fronts and suggested that the goal was a more coordinated, comprehensive and aggressive response to Hurricane Rita than it mustered for Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Bush spoke to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency poured equipment and supplies into the region, including gasoline to head off a possible shortage. The Pentagon prepared to send thousands of active-duty military personnel, if necessary, for relief and rescue efforts. Hurricane Rita, bearing down on Texas as a Category 4 storm with winds of 150 miles an hour, presented a critical test to Mr. Bush, FEMA and the rest of the federal government little more than three weeks after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, exposed serious flaws in Washington's disaster planning and left Mr. Bush politically wounded. As a result, the response to Hurricane Rita differed fundamentally from the preparations as Hurricane Katrina moved across the Gulf of Mexico. FEMA has placed 14 urban search and rescue teams in Texas, compared with seven teams in place before Hurricane Katrina. By Thursday evening, the agency planned to have 45 truckloads of water, 45 of ice and 25 of meals assembled at federal centers in Texas, officials said. Other federal agencies had bigger roles, as well, including the Transportation Department, which has provided 650 buses to Texas and Louisiana to help with evacuations. On Wednesday, the department also started an airlift to move certain people out of Beaumont, Corpus Christi and Houston, an effort that intensified on Thursday. The department planned to fly 20 to 25 flights from Houston to elsewhere in the state by the end of Thursday, moving 4,000 people. With lives on the line and another big swath of the United States facing the prospect of widespread damage to homes, businesses, roads and psyches, Mr. Bush has compelling, substantive reasons to focus on the new storm. But his job is all the more challenging for the political risk it entails after Hurricane Katrina. Despite Mr. Bush's making an open-ended commitment to rebuild New Orleans and address the needs of the rest of the Gulf Coast, his popularity poll numbers remain at or near the lowest of his presidency, his own party is divided over the spending necessary to make good on his promise, and Democrats are attacking him for policies they say have shredded the social safety net. STORM AND CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT"
"At Methodist Hospital, workers nailed plywood outside the emergency room windows on Thursday afternoon, while doctors inside raced to treat 14 patients evacuated from nursing homes. On Wednesday and again on Thursday, the 900-bed hospital appeared to have the situation under control as it took in 30 patients who were evacuated from hospitals that feared flooding from Hurricane Rita. But there was obvious confusion over the nursing home patients. The 14 patients arrived before noon, were taken from the emergency room to head to a town 40 miles north of Houston, but because of huge traffic jams, were suddenly returned to the emergency room, causing a small crisis. ''We have to expect the unexpected,'' said Dr. Jeff Kalina, the hospital's associate medical director for the emergency department. ''We're banking on the lessons we've learned from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Allison,'' which caused considerable flooding here four years ago. Taking those lessons to heart, hospitals and nursing homes in eastern Texas have moved early and aggressively to evacuate patients. More than 24 hospitals in Houston, Galveston and other communities have closed or evacuated patients, sending some as far as Dallas and San Antonio. A spokeswoman for the Texas Hospital Association, Amanda Engler, said the 72 hospitals in Houston had decided that a mass patient evacuation was unnecessary. Ms. Engler said just a handful of hospitals in the city, in especially flood-prone areas, had been evacuated. ''Some of the state's major trauma facilities are in Houston,'' she said. ''Who knows what will happen when the storm passes? Shutting them down is not an option.'' San Antonio, 219 miles west of Galveston, has taken in 300 hospital patients. ''We have ambulances from all over Texas, even some from Arkansas, to help,'' said Eric Epley, executive director of the Southern Texas Regional Advisory Council for Trauma. The council, he said, was working with 47 charter buses, several military ''ambuses'' that hold 12 litters each and several helicopters, including a large Bell helicopter that can carry four patients. ''The thing that's been most frustrating is the lack of ambulances,'' Mr. Epley said. ''Texas is a big place, and it takes a day just to drive ambulances here from other states. ''One thing that's pleased me is that all these health systems can be rather competitive with each other, but in a time of disaster, it's welcome to see all these hospitals and companies working together.'' After treating 500 Hurricane Katrina evacuees, Methodist tried to increase its ability to treat a possible new surge in patients by accelerating discharges of patients who are ready to go. The hospital, which had more than $100million in damage from the flooding of Hurricane Allison in 2001, has moved its backup generators to the fifth floor. It has also built floodgates to protect against hurricanes and the 42 feet of water that filled its basement in 2001. It has food and water to last at least a week and enough fuel to ensure that its backup generators run for more than four days. When the hospital uses such generators, that cuts off its air-conditioning, which is viewed as a nonessential function. The temperature here rose to 98 on Thursday, but is forecast to fall to the mid-80's when Hurricane Rita arrives. HCA, the giant hospital corporation, rushed on Thursday to empty the 373-bed Bayshore Medical Center in Pasadena. It had already closed three hospitals that feared flooding, the East Houston Regional Medical Center, with 131 beds; the Mainland Medical Center in Texas City, 226 beds; and the Clear Lake Regional Medical Center in Webster, 482 beds. Kathryn Hurt, a patient with congestive heart failure, seemed undaunted on Thursday afternoon after a helicopter took her 25 miles from the Clear Lake hospital to the Spring Branch Medical Center in Houston. Spring Branch transformed a post-operative recovery room into an intensive care unit to accommodate Ms. Hurt and two other Clear Lake patients. ''It's all been really smooth,'' said Ms. Hurt, a retired bank data-processing worker. ''The medevac was neat. It was a thrill. I don't have words to say how great they've been. The thing that struck me is these people have their own families to worry about, but they're taking care of me as if I'm a member of their family.'' STORM AND CRISIS: MEDICAL CENTERS"
"Facing a potentially devastating hit from Hurricane Rita, the Houston-area economy ground to a halt yesterday as more than four million residents evacuated the city and other nearby coastal areas on clogged highways, which were made worse by motorists stranded as gasoline ran short. From Corpus Christi in the south to Port Arthur on the Louisiana border, businesses along the Texas coast -- including everything from large oil refineries and chemical plants to United Parcel Service and Wal-Mart -- suspended most operations. Standing squarely at the heart of the region, Houston, the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area, accounts for roughly 2 percent of annual economic output, or about $250 billion, according to Economy.com, a research firm. That is much larger than the $50 billion in output attributed to New Orleans and $10 billion from Gulfport. Depending on how severe it is when it makes landfall, Hurricane Rita could deliver an even greater temporary blow to economic activity than Katrina, largely because of the greater scale of the local economy and the considerably bigger concentration of energy facilities in Texas than in Louisiana and Mississippi. A major disruption to the nation's strained oil refining and distribution network -- which some experts said could last for weeks -- could send gasoline and other fuel prices soaring. The hurricane could also wreak significant environmental havoc, because the Texas coast is dotted with large petrochemical plants that store large quantities of dangerous chemicals. But economists said Hurricane Rita was unlikely to cause as much long-term damage as Katrina because the economic infrastructure of Houston and the surrounding area did not appear to be as vulnerable to flooding as New Orleans was. ''It's hard to envision a scenario,'' said Mark Zandi, Economy.com's chief economist, ''where Houston is impacted anywhere near as much as New Orleans.'' The normally busy downtown areas of Houston were largely deserted yesterday after businesses heeded Mayor Bill White's request to send nonessential workers home on Wednesday. Stores at the sprawling Galleria Shopping Center were closed and were expected to stay that way through the weekend. A few hotels, like the Westin, Hyatt and Doubletree, said they would remain open. ''Today, it's a ghost town,'' said Brett Perlman, a consultant and a former Texas state utility regulator. ''The entire city is on the road headed out of town. It's a mess.'' Despite weakening to Category 4, the storm was still packing winds of 145 miles per hour and appeared headed toward eastern Texas and western Louisiana. The area is thick with refineries and other chemical plants. Many went into a heightened state of alert Wednesday and spent most of yesterday shutting facilities and evacuating workers. Dow Chemical, which is just now getting its big plant in St. Charles, La., back up to speed, had already shut six Texas plants by yesterday afternoon; Dow expects that by dawn today its huge complex in Freeport, the largest chemical production facility it runs anywhere in the world, will be dark as well. ''We are shutting things down sooner than we did with Katrina, but that's mainly because local authorities are insisting on it,'' said Chris R. Huntley, a Dow spokesman. ''But otherwise, Katrina proved we had the right procedures in place.'' With memories of Katrina still fresh, the petrochemical and energy industries were not alone in preparing for the hurricane. As of yesterday afternoon, some 60 Wal-Mart facilities, including distribution centers and stores, had closed. Wal-Mart has moved even earlier than before Katrina to be ready. Before shutting down two huge distribution centers in Baytown, about 25 miles outside of Houston, workers scrambled to dispatch some 160 truckloads to other facilities away from the storm's path. Another 45 to 50 trucks filled with disaster-relief items left the distribution centers to locations along the Gulf Coast, according to John Bisio, regional director for community affairs at the company. United Parcel Service, which lost a significant number of packages when some 22 buildings were damaged during Katrina, is less worried this time about moving packages right after the storm and more about keeping them safe, along with its trucks and employees. It has already suspended shipments to the area. But the chemical industry may have the most at stake. About 70 percent of the nation's capacity for making ethylene, which forms the building block for products as varied as shirts, plastic wrap and appliance housing, lies in the storm's path. BASF, which had no damage from Katrina, has evacuated eight plants in Texas, including its huge chemical plant in Freeport and a naphtha cracker in Port Arthur that it just installed in 2002. Bayer produces a large portion of its polycarbonates, polyurethanes and other chemicals in Baytown; it shut that plant and evacuated all but a skeleton crew by yesterday. But while most in the industry expect some lost production and sales, few expect lasting devastation. Flooding is certainly possible but the topography of the area is different from southern Louisiana and most of the companies say they have long had adequate plans in place for preventing toxic leaks, for protecting equipment, and for getting employees and products out of harm's way. ''Anyone who invested in these areas has designed their plants for hurricanes, and we have a detailed plan for protecting the plants and moving the materials and people,'' Klaus Peter Löbbe, BASF's chairman, said. The Environmental Protection Agency said it has 8 to 10 officials standing by in Dallas and 2 in Austin ready to move into stricken areas as soon as the storm passes. Up to 10 more officials were making their way to Dallas, said Sam Coleman, who is heading the agency's response to the hurricanes. Mr. Coleman said the agency's response to Katrina had been swift and thorough. But a Sierra Club official said the E.P.A. had been slow to visit Superfund sites in New Orleans and disclose its findings to the public.The Texas coast ''is a far more industrial area than New Orleans,'' said Ed Hopkins, the Sierra Club's director for environmental quality programs. ''The big concern is the potential for a catastrophic release of an extremely hazardous chemical from a tank. Thankfully, people seem to be evacuating from the area.'' Energy companies, which still have not completely recovered from Katrina, closed as many as 15 refineries in Texas and Louisiana, accounting for about 23 percent of the nation's capacity. By comparison, Katrina initially shut down 10 percent of the nation's refining capacity in Louisiana and Mississippi, and about half of that is still out of service. Oil companies also evacuated nearly all their production platforms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. ''We knew that things were getting fairly stretched and there was exposure to potentially even small shocks,'' said Paul Horsnell, director of energy research at Barclays Capital in London. ''But that is not a small shock; it's an absolute, monstrous hurricane.'' The energy industry could conceivably bounce back faster this time because it evacuated facilities in a more orderly fashion and across a larger area than with Katrina. Moreover, said Dan Pickering, president of Pickering Energy Partners of Houston, the Texas and northwest Louisiana refineries are clumped in several clusters that are dozens of miles from each other, so if one area gets walloped the others may escape relatively unscathed. Oil prices moved higher during the day but ended trading little changed yesterday. Gasoline futures were up 8.63 cents. The retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline averaged $2.755, down from $2.764 Wednesday, according to AAA. Prices spiked past $3 in many cities after Katrina hit, and Mr. Horsnell said they could again rise sharply if this storm keeps refiners out of commission for more than a few days. With the hurricane's approach, CenterPoint Energy, with 1.8 million customers in the Houston area, recalled some 70 employees from New Orleans. Yesterday, CenterPoint had some 2,300 linemen and 1,600 tree-trimmers ready to restore power and fix poles, said Emily Mir Thompson, a spokeswoman for CenterPoint. ''We are telling our customers,'' she said, ''to be prepared to be without electricity for up to two weeks.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE EXODUS"
"Heeding days of dire warnings about Hurricane Rita, as many as 2.5 million people jammed evacuation routes on Thursday, creating colossal 100-mile-long traffic jams that left many people stranded and out of gas as the huge storm bore down on the Texas coast. Acknowledging that ''being on the highway is a deathtrap,'' Mayor Bill White asked for military help in rushing scarce fuel to stranded drivers. Mr. White and the top official in Harris County, Judge Robert Eckels, admitted that their plans had not anticipated the volume of traffic. They maintained that they had not urged such a widespread evacuation, although only a day earlier they invoked the specter of Hurricane Katrina, and told residents that the ''time for waiting was over.'' Officials also made matters worse for themselves by announcing at one point that they would use inbound lanes on one highway to ease the outbound crush, only to abort the plan later, saying it was impractical. The unending lines of vehicles heading out of Houston were only one indication of how seriously people along the Gulf Coast regarded the threat of Hurricane Rita, particularly after the devastation and death caused less than a month ago by Hurricane Katrina. As the day progressed the storm weakened slightly, from Category 5 to Category 4 status, as the maximum wind speed fell from 175 miles per hour to about 140. The hurricane also shifted course toward the north, with landfall expected early Saturday between Galveston and Port Arthur, Tex. The shift offered a glimmer of hope to the panicked Houston area but threatened further flooding in New Orleans and other areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina. But officials warned that the storm still had the potential to cause widespread damage to Houston, and after witnessing what happened in New Orleans, few people here were willing to take their chances. In Baton Rouge, La., Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco called for the evacuation of a nearly half a million people in the southwest portion of her state. ''Head north, head north,'' she said. ''You cannot go east, you cannot go west, head north. If you know the local roads that go north, take those.'' Noting the difficulty medical examiners have had in identifying the dead from Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Blanco offered morbid advice to those who refuse to evacuate. ''Perhaps they should write their Social Security numbers on their arms in indelible ink,'' she said. The Houston area's two major air gateways, Hobby Airport and Bush Intercontinental, suffered major delays when more than 150 screeners from the Transportation Security Administration, facing their own evacuation concerns, did not show up for work. The agency later rushed in replacements, a spokeswoman said, but passengers, already burdening the system with extra luggage for their trips to safety, waited for hours to go through security. After crawling only 10 or 20 miles in nine hours, some drivers turned around to take their chances at home rather than risk being caught in the open when the hurricane struck. Starting Wednesday night and throughout Thursday, the major evacuation routes, Interstate 45 north to Dallas, I-10 West to San Antonio, Route 290 to College Station and Austin, and 59 to Lufkin grew into hundred-mile-long parking lots. Drivers heeding the call to evacuate Galveston island and other low-lying areas took 4 and 5 hours to cover the 50 miles to Houston. And there the long crawl north began in earnest. The delays were long enough for one ice cream seller on I-45 to do a brisk business on the highway, as drivers left their stopped cars to buy refreshments. Cars overheated and broke down and others ran out of gas, worsening the crush. ''The question is how many people will be gravely ill and die sitting on the side of the freeway,'' said State Representative Garnet Coleman, Democrat of Houston. ''Dying not from the storm, but from the evacuation.'' Mr. Coleman's family had tried to leave the city Thursday at his urging -- he is traveling on the West Coast -- but they gave up after 12 hours of stalled traffic, without even passing the city's outer ring highway. ''If you can't move outside the city of Houston in 12 hours, then nobody else is getting out,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''This is it. Because even if you tried to leave now, you would not move fast enough to get out of harm's way in advance of the storm.'' The situation raised serious worries about how the city would handle something like a terrorist attack, he said. Timothy Adcock, 48, a Houston landscaper who was in the 15th hour of inching to Tyler in a companion's pickup truck after his car broke down under the grueling conditions, said, ''I never saw anything so disorganized.'' ''We did everything we were supposed to do,'' Mr. Adcock said, ''secure our house, left early, checked routes, checked on our neighbors.'' But he said, ''when we got out there we were totally on our own.'' A high-occupancy vehicle lane went unused, he said, and they saw no police officers. At one point, Mr. Adcock said, he called the Texas Department of Transportation for an alternate route, but the woman who answered could not find a map. Many stranded drivers said they had responded to official pleas to flee made by Mayor White and Judge Eckels, who often invoked the specter of Hurricane Katrina. ''Don't wait, the time for waiting is over,'' Mr. White urged Wednesday. ''Don't follow the example of New Orleans and think someone's going to get you.'' But Thursday as the traffic chaos worsened, he and Judge Eckels appeared to back off their dire warnings, saying that the only mandatory evacuation order concerned those in flood-prone areas along the coast. ''If you're not in the evacuation zone, follow the news,'' the mayor said. ''The storm is oscillating. We may be in a better position.'' And he maintained: ''We have never called for the evacuation of Houston. We asked people to use their common sense.'' But Judge Eckels acknowledged under questioning that the massive congestion ''was not in the plan.'' While the storm is expected to hit the shore with as much strength as Hurricane Katrina did, forecasters added an additional concern Thursday, saying it was likely to stall inland for several days and disgorge enormous amounts of rain. Hurricane Katrina, while similar in intensity and size, did not cause inland flooding after hitting the Gulf Coast because it was swept out of the South by the jet stream, said Timothy J. Schott, a National Weather Service meteorologist. But the jet stream, a high-altitude, east-flowing river of air, has shifted to near the Great Lakes, Mr. Schott said, and so cannot be relied on to ''scoop out'' the swirling, Georgia-size mass of moisture and rain clouds that will be left behind this weekend as Hurricane Rita moves over East Texas, Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas. ''This is looming as a big problem,'' Mr. Schott said. ''The storm could spend three days hanging around there'' and could easily produce 10 inches or more of rain, enough to cause intense flooding. Forecasters said the pinwheeling bands of thunderstorms radiating several hundred miles from the eye of the hurricane could produce up to five inches of rain in New Orleans, near the limit of what Army Corpsof Engineers officials said the city's taxed pumps could handle. Governor Blanco of Louisiana appealed for 30,000 more Army and National Guard troops to respond to Hurricane Rita. Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen, director of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, said he would forward to request for to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff. Frank E. Gutierrez, the emergency management coordinator for Harris County, said that models for an emergency evacuation envisioned 800,000 to 1.2 million people but that ''well over 2.5 million'' hit the road to flee Hurricane Rita. Officials in Texas also said they recognized a serious situation had arisen in the evacuation, with many people stranded on traffic-choked highways, without gas and without water. The state had promised to send gas trucks to relieve the problem, Mayor White said, but he could not say how long it would be before those trucks arrived. In the meantime, he said, the city intended to send out vans and buses filled with water to take to the stranded people, and to evacuate some on the buses, as needed. To that end, Judge Eckels put out a call for volunteers to help load these vans and buses with water, and said that their help was needed immediately. Mayor White deflected questions from reporters asking him to assess who was to blame for what happened Thursday, specifically the lack of gasoline where needed. ''This is not the time to look at who should have done what on the emergency,'' the mayor said. ''This is not the time we're going to get into who should've done what.'' Earlier, as the crush worsened, state transportation officials announced that contraflow lanes would be established first on I-45, then 290 and lastly on I-10. But by midafternoon, with traffic immobile on 290, the plan for extra lanes there was dropped, stranding many and prompting other to reverse course. ''We need that route so resources can still get into the city,'' said a transportation spokeswoman, Janelle Gbur. Elsewhere, with the storm's expected path shifting, mandatory evacuations were ordered in the Beaumont, Tex., area. Across the spectrum, from the federal government to the states involved, the response to Hurricane Rita differed fundamentally from the preparations less than a month ago, as Hurricane Katrina moved across the Gulf of Mexico toward the coast. At the request of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, FEMA was moving to send additional fuel to Texas. ''I just talked with the governor this morning and that was his No. 1 request is to make sure we can get some fuel down there, to make sure those cars have fuels, make sure the first responders have fuels, and we are working to process that right now,'' said R. David Paulison, acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. For people stuck in traffic trying to evacuate, Mr. Paulison advised them not to turn around and go home. ''I know they're frustrated, there's a lot of traffic out there,'' he said. ''Again, that's why we try to evacuate early. If they stay on the road now, they're going to have enough time to get out of harm's way.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"Downtown avenues lined with magnificent Victorian buildings in this city were empty on Thursday. Entire neighborhoods of windblown bungalows were boarded up. But the Hard Times and Misery Saloon, at the corner of 43rd and S Streets, was full. ''I'll fend off the looters with my Ka-Bar,'' said Richard Deore, 57, a meatcutter at a Kroger's supermarket, describing the lethal potential of the combat knife used by the Marine Corps. Nursing a Budweiser at 11 a.m., Mr. Deore said he had no desire to flee Galveston, even as Hurricane Rita placed the city in its crosshairs. ''I'm going to go rat hunting when this is over,'' Mr. Deore said, explaining how in past hurricanes the storm surge pushed rats out of their hiding places in the rocks along the sea wall. Galveston is no stranger to huge storms. At least 6,000 people died in the storm of 1900, when funeral pyres of unclaimed bodies burned for weeks. Aristocrats sipped Champagne in the ballroom of the Hotel Galvez during the storm of 1915, when eight people died. Martial law was declared here in 1961, when Hurricane Carla left 42 people dead. So, despite the images of the destruction and death brought on by Hurricane Katrina and an evacuation ordered by Galveston's mayor, it might come as little surprise that some storm-weary people here are staying put. Most of Galveston's 60,000 residents have fled, but dozens -- perhaps even a hundred or more -- remain. ''This is God working, man,'' said Robert Shumake, 50, whose car broke down on the interstate Wednesday night as he and his sister and nephew tried to leave the city. Mr. Shumake, a former cook, said he returned to Galveston after repairing his vehicle. On Thursday, Mr. Shumake and his nephew, Russell Cavender, 17, walked along the sea wall holding an American flag and another flag saying, ''We Support Our Troops.'' Mr. Shumake, a stout man with a bushy goatee and a ponytail, said: ''The Lord doesn't want us going. He wants me carrying this flag.'' There were other scattered holdouts. Walking along the sea wall on Thursday morning, a surfer, John Benson, said the waves in the Gulf of Mexico were six to eight feet tall, two to three feet higher than normal in Galveston. With a nine-foot purple surfboard in hand, he said he expected the storm would generate 15- to 17-foot waves. ''This is a freebie right here courtesy of Rita,'' said Mr. Benson, 47, a Galveston native. Mr. Benson said the allure of the waves and television images of gridlocked traffic on Interstate 45 would keep him here through the storm. Some said it would be foolhardy to leave, given the possibility of crime or looting in the wake of the storm. Bob Faris, the owner of Bob's Grocery, perhaps the only food store left open in the city, said he had worked too hard over the preceding years to leave his establishment. ''I checked with the Sheriff's Department to see if I could use my gun, and they said if I do, make sure he's dead,'' said Mr. Faris, 48, brandishing a 9-millimeter pistol, as customers filed into the store to buy frozen pizzas, beer and beef jerky. ''I'm not leaving anything to chance. We saw what happened in New Orleans.'' In a neighborhood near the shoreline, some residents said that police officers and city officials were seeking refuge in the luxurious San Luis Hotel, securely built above a 15-foot bunker across from the sea wall. Most of the hotel staff has gone, leaving the officials with few amenities as they set up operations. ''One police officer drove up to me and told me, 'You're going to die!' pointing his big finger at me,'' said Juanita Levine, 58, a retired nurse, who decided to ride out the storm with her sister, Mary Allen, 61. ''I told him I was staying right here, not running to some big expensive hotel. I have faith in God.'' Back at the Hard Times and Misery Saloon, regulars philosophized over $1.75 beers ($1.50 during happy hour). Some were B.O.I.'s, shorthand in Galveston for those born on the island. Others were I.B.C.'s, islanders by choice. With one exception, none had any apprehensions about staying. Only Franklin Courtright, 53, a home remodeler and B.O.I., said he might leave by Friday morning. ''I'm on the fence,'' said Mr. Courtright, whose nickname is Butch. ''I'm paying attention to this one.'' Seated at Mr. Courtright's side, Sonny Blumrick, a retired auto parts specialist, described Mr. Courtright as the coward of the bunch. ''This is a waiting game,'' Mr. Blumrick said. ''Just wait and see, wait and see.'' The saloon was not the only place in Galveston where those who stayed were contemplating a quick escape or painful associations with New Orleans. At the Poop Deck, a local hangout overlooking the Gulf, Dennis Christian was sweeping out the bed of a pickup truck and moving Cokes inside late Thursday morning. He said he was waiting for I-45 to clear before leaving Galveston. ''We had a good time last night, but we're not going to be the last idiots to leave down here,'' Mr. Christian said. ''We're going to be the next to last.'' Choking back tears, Mr. Christian said his brother, who lived just outside New Orleans, fell victim to Hurricane Katrina. ''I done seen my brother in a body bag, and I don't want to be in one,'' he said. ''Katrina got him being stupid like me.'' ''It's either get out of here or get packed in a body bag.'' STORM AND CRISIS: STAYING PUT"
"As the outer bands of Hurricane Rita raked past with gusty winds and showers, water began seeping into the shattered and empty Lower Ninth Ward through makeshift dike repairs on Thursday, and the Army Corps of Engineers expressed concern about just how reliably a weakened levee system could protect this devastated city against a tidal surge along Lake Pontchartrain. Little more than 24 days after Hurricane Katrina killed at least 832 people in Louisiana, Hurricane Rita was expected to scour New Orleans with winds that could reach tropical force as it headed toward landfall near the Louisiana-Texas border. At the least, two to four inches of floodwater are expected here in a city that sits largely below sea level, Mayor C. Ray Nagin said on Thursday, adding that he had been reassured by the corps that the city's mended levee system could withstand an expected storm surge of three to five feet. ''If it's any higher than that, then you can have water pushed into the city,'' Mayor Nagin said at a news conference. ''Then the pumping capacity becomes really challenged.'' Five thousand troops from the National Guard and the 82nd Airborne Division are preparing to secure New Orleans against another storm, and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco has called for an additional 30,000 soldiers. Mayor Nagin said he was watching weather reports with a kind of paranoia now that Hurricane Rita had made a turn that could take it farther east than previously expected. City employees, once upbeat about the rebuilding process in a city that still lacks drinking water and has only limited electricity, have grown anxious about the prospect of being hit by even the periphery of a second powerful storm, the mayor said. ''People are struggling with the fact, 'Why such powerful storms back to back?''' Mayor Nagin said. ''We're talking to people and trying to get them to focus on the task at hand. Maybe we'll be spared this time.'' In the Lower Ninth Ward, where two gaping breaches in the Industrial Canal levee submerged and splintered one of the poorest sections of the city, four to eight inches of water began seeping back into some abandoned and destroyed neighborhoods by noon on Thursday. Small waterfalls of leakage could be seen several feet below the top of the repaired levee as wind pushed rising water from Lake Pontchartrain through the Industrial Canal. This was to be expected, said Chad Rachel, a civil engineer with the corps, after an inspection of the repaired breaches. There did not appear to be any erosion of the compacted clay base of the patched dike, he said, adding that he felt certain the large, interlocking stones atop the base would be able to withstand the expected storm surge. ''We don't expect any problem with a catastrophic breach,'' Mr. Rachel said. By dusk, however, water had continued to rise, and Maj. Barry Guidry of the Army offered a direr assessment after examining the leaking at the Industrial Canal. ''The levee's going to cave in,'' Major Guidry said. ''In the middle of the night, this thing is going to be gone.'' Even if heavy flooding did happen again in the Lower Ninth Ward, this might serve as a kind of safety valve that could prevent water from submerging more inhabitable parts of the city, police officials said. ''This is a graveyard already,'' said Sgt. Bryan Lampard of the New Orleans police, who was in the Lower Ninth Ward searching for bodies or the rare possibility of a survivor. ''This area is not coming back anytime soon.'' Houses were shoved off their foundations and splintered in this ruined section of the city. Cars were turned upside-down. The damage resembled that on the Mississippi Coast more than it did many other parts of New Orleans. About the only thing salvageable from most of these houses was a hammer, said Eric Baum, a spokesman for a federal search-and-rescue team from Miami. Rescuers left the area as the water continued to seep in but said they had nearly completed their search for bodies. Only about 20 were recovered in the Lower Ninth Ward, said Capt. Tim Bayard, who is in charge of the recovery effort for the New Orleans police. This suggested, Mayor Nagin said, that the death toll from Hurricane Katrina, once predicted to be in the thousands, now seemed to be ''much lower than anyone imagined, which I'm thankful for.'' At the breached 17th Street Canal, which flooded the Lakeview section of New Orleans, a crew from the Army Corps of Engineers finished shoring up sandbags and metal pilings that jutted above the side of the levee like rusty dominoes. The levee was no longer leaking, but a direct hit by even a greatly diminished Hurricane Rita, or storm surges of more than 10 or 12 feet from Lake Pontchartrain could wash out the makeshift plugs, said Robert Foret, a quality assurance officer with the corps. ''We have saturated levees right now, so this is all guesswork,'' Mr. Foret said. The plugging of breaches in the 17th Street Canal and London Avenue Canal to protect against a storm surge has required a tradeoff, Mayor Nagin said. Water might be kept from coming into the city, he said, but it will be more difficult to force out from the midtown area because the improvised repairs have left three of the city's most powerful pumps unavailable, he said. ''Everybody's on pins and needles right now,'' Mr. Foret said. Ten buses were available near the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center to take residents out of the nearly empty east bank of New Orleans, but only one or two people decided to evacuate what is essentially a ghost town on Wednesday, Mayor Nagin said. He cautioned that Hurricane Rita was a dangerous storm, and although New Orleans did not figure to bear the brunt of the hurricane, the city could not let its guard down. If the storm made a significant turn eastward, Mayor Nagin said, ''we have a whole other ballgame.'' STORM AND CRISIS: NEW ORLEANS"
"EACH Katrina is handling the problem in her own way. One, Katrina Petrillo, 13, an eighth grader at Convent of the Sacred Heart school in Manhattan, got so tired of being mocked as ''Hurricane Katrina'' by her summer vacation acquaintances that she told teachers on the first day of school on Thursday that she is now going by ''Kat.'' ''I realized my name is going to go down in history,'' she said, ''as one of the biggest storms ever.'' Others with last year's 281st most popular baby name for a girl are coping with their fateful association with the devastating storm by trying everything from defending their name against those who might make fun of it to questioning the hurricane naming system. Katrina Leskanich, the former lead singer of Katrina and the Waves, who lives in London, said that when her Web site began getting thousands of hits -- more than 22,000 on Aug. 29, the day the hurricane hit New Orleans -- she thought it was because her new solo song was getting airplay on BBC radio. Now she's glad that because of a decision made a month before the storm, her new album's release has been delayed from Sept. 5 to October. ''It would have looked like the most tasteless exercise in self-promotion.'' She said she hopes her band's 1985 hit ''Walking on Sunshine'' might eventually become an anthem for New Orleans recovery. Another famous Katrina, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of the left-leaning publication The Nation, became incensed when Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk radio host, began referring to the storm as ''Hurricane Katrina vanden Heuvel.'' In a blog on the magazine's Web site, Ms. vanden Heuvel dismissed the personal attack and wheeled the issue into more comfortable terrain, writing, ''We should be asking serious questions about why the Iraq war has led the White House to divert funds from an urgent project to upgrade levees and pumping stations in Louisiana, and why there aren't enough National Guard troops on hand in what is one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history.'' Katrina, which means pure, reached its pinnacle of popularity as a name in 1980, when it was the 90th most common female baby name. Following only the whims of the fashion climate, 50 years ago the name was 489th in popularity, according to the Social Security Administration. It climbed to its peak 25 years later. But it slipped to No. 127 in 1990 and continued to fall. Nevertheless plenty of Katrina pride remains. ''We have nothing to be ashamed of,'' wrote a contributor to a Yahoo group who identified herself online as Coloradokat65. ''Katrina is a lovely name.'' Before the storm hit, there were a lot of jokes on the group's message board: ''My parents heard on the radio that she was shaping up to be the most expensive,'' wrote another member, ''and thought that it fit me to a tee.'' But as the reality sunk in, the mood darkened. ''Is anyone else depressed about having to share your name with a deadly hurricane?'' wrote a member of the group who used the screen name kelsken. ''At first I was too excited about seeing my name all over TV,'' wrote another member in response, ''but as this hurricane progressed I will always remember my name associated with tragedy.'' Katrinas can expect three to five years of stoking bad memories before the sharpness of the pain recedes, said Katrina Cochran, a disaster relief psychologist who has worked with victims of the Oklahoma City bombings and the Sept. 11 attacks. Ms. Cochran, who has been hired by Church World Service to counsel hurricane victims, said she hopes they will forgive her name. ''People will see me trying to help and offering care and compassion, and it might actually help them recover more quickly,'' she said. Despite the crisis, the name Katrina might not be as finished as, say, Adolf is. Hurricane Hugo, the deadly 1989 storm, did not doom that name. In 1988 it was No. 439; in 1989, No. 407; and in 1990 it was No. 415. Last year it was at 367. ''How about doing away with names?'' asked Katrina Heron, author of ''Safe: The Race to Protect Ourselves in a Newly Dangerous World'' (HarperCollins 2005), and a former editor at The New York Times Magazine. ''Every time this horrible natural disaster strikes some group of people gets sideswiped.'' Ms. Heron has an alternative idea. ''I think we should name hurricanes after vegetables we hate.'' A spokesman from the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, which issues names of hurricanes based on an alphabetical list that rotates annually and repeats every six years, did not respond to messages, but Stu Ostro, a senior meteorologist at the Weather Channel, said the world body was unlikely to change the system, which started in 1953. Experts had found that just giving storms numbers or locations was confusing. ''The goal is to give valuable information clearly that can help save lives,'' Mr. Ostro said. ''Maybe that's some solace the people named Camille or Katrina or Charley or Ivan can take.'' The World Meteorological Organization does have a policy of retiring the names of particularly vicious storms, like Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, which pounded Florida last year, so this is likely to be the last Hurricane Katrina. For now Ms. Petrillo, like the other Katrinas, is coping, and helping. She and a group of friends set up a lemonade stand in Fair Harbor on Fire Island and raised $1,000 for the Red Cross's hurricane relief fund. And, she admitted, she may just be using the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina to pursue a long-held fantasy. ''I always did practice signing my autograph 'Kat' when I was younger,'' she said. ''I always figured that if I became famous, it would be easier to just write Kat.'' Correction: September 18, 2005, Sunday An article last Sunday about women and girls named Katrina referred imprecisely to one of them, Katrina Heron. She is an author of the book ''Safe: The Race to Protect Ourselves in a Newly Dangerous World'' (with Martha Baer, Oliver Morton and Evan Ratliff) -- not the sole author."
"THE images of starving, exhausted, flood-bedraggled people fleeing New Orleans and southern Mississippi over the last two weeks have scandalized many Americans long accustomed to seeing such scenes only in faraway storm-tossed or war-ravaged places like Kosovo, Sudan or Banda Aceh. But Hurricane Katrina delivered America its own refugee crisis, arguably the worst since Sherman's army burned its way across the South. And though the word ''refugee'' is offensive to some, and not accurate according to international law, it conveys a fundamental truth: these are people who will be unable to return home for months, possibly years. Many almost certainly will make new homes in new places. It is not the first time the United States has faced a mass internal migration: think of the ''Okies'' who fled the drought-ravaged Dust Bowl for fertile California in the 1930's, or Southern blacks who took the Delta blues to Chicago in the first half of the last century. But the wreckage wrought by Katrina across the Gulf Coast is probably unprecedented in American history. No storm has matched the depth and breadth of its devastation. And the two disasters that demolished major cities -- the Chicago fire of 1871 and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 -- occurred when the federal government lacked the resources and agencies to help the displaced. They offer few clues about how to aid and comfort Katrina's victims. For that reason, many experts say, the federal government should look for long-term strategies among the groups that have resettled millions of refugees from those faraway storm-tossed or war-ravaged places -- two million of them here in the United States since 1975. ''These groups have a different way of seeing the problem: that it's not just short-term emergency relief,'' said Roberta Cohen, an expert on refugees at the Brookings Institution who helped write guidelines on aiding internally displaced people for the United Nations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has welcomed some help from agencies that specialize in disaster relief overseas, including the United Nations and the United States Agency for International Development. But despite Katrina's magnitude, FEMA officials say their approach to resettling evacuees is not likely to differ significantly from the approach here to past disasters. They have ordered 100,000 trailers and mobile homes that will be placed in ''trailer cities'' in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. They have begun finding short-term apartments in Houston and Baton Rouge. And the Red Cross and other aid groups plan to provide psychological counseling and housing assistance at its temporary shelters. ''This is larger, but the process is the same,'' said James McIntyre, a FEMA spokesman. Experts in refugee resettlement say the old ways might not be enough. Thousands of the New Orleans evacuees were poor or elderly; many were on welfare or have limited job skills. Many have been sent far from family and friends. Meeting their needs, and rebuilding the shattered Gulf Coast cities, will take a far more long-term and comprehensive plan, those experts say. ''The approach now is very ad hoc,'' said Mark Franken, executive director of migration and refugee services for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. ''They are moving people from one temporary environment to another.'' Mr. Franken said nine resettlement organizations had proposed re-creating their refugee services for evacuees: finding jobs and long-term independent housing, acclimating people to new communities and providing careful case management that lasts months. The Bush administration is still reviewing that proposal, he said. The administration, he added, said groups should be prepared to care for half a million evacuees. Other experts contend that the federal government should create a large-scale public works program to employ evacuees, possibly in rebuilding New Orleans itself. Gene Dewey, who retired in June as the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, said one model, as far-fetched as it sounds, might be the Afghan Civilian Conservation Corps -- named after the Depression-era program started by President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- that the Bush administration created in Afghanistan in 2003. By paying returnees to build roads, plant trees and restore schools, the program provided dignity as well as money, Mr. Dewey said. ''This is a time when you need that kind of Franklin Roosevelt thinking,'' he said. Hugh Parmer, who worked for the United States Agency for International Development in the 1990's and who has advised federal officials on a post-Katrina strategy, said the Kosovo crisis of 1999 taught him that the most humane way to resettle refugees was to avoid placing them in large shelters or camps. Mr. Parmer added that the organization he currently leads, the American Refugee Committee International, plans to open mobile health clinics in Louisiana this week. It will be the first time the group, founded in 1979 to assist Southeast Asian refugees, has done work inside the United States. ''We run six mobile clinics in Darfur, and we've been joking that we're going to move the Sudan model to southern Louisiana,'' Mr. Parmer said. Julia Taft, who directed a Ford administration task force that oversaw the resettlement of 131,000 Southeast Asian refugees in the United States in 1975, said religious groups and private relief agencies were able to resettle those refugees in nine months because they had a vast network of volunteers, churches and synagogues. ''What we need to do is treat them like refugees,'' Ms. Taft said of the hurricane's victims. ''We've got to recognize that they are going to be displaced for a significant period of time.'' Some people, most prominently the Rev. Jesse Jackson, have objected to calling the storm victims refugees, asserting that the word is inappropriate and even racist. Under international law, refugees are defined as people who cross national borders to flee persecution. Ms. Cohen of the Brookings Institution said the evacuees from the Gulf Coast fit neatly into a newer category: ''internally displaced persons.'' In the 1990's, when the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to ethnic strife and civil war across the Balkans and sub-Saharan Africa, the term was popularized by aid workers who contended that Western nations should intervene, with force if necessary, when governments failed to help large numbers of displaced people. The United States, thanks to its resources, has largely been spared such dislocations. But not completely. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 may have displaced more than half a million people. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 displaced more than 200,000 people. The Chicago fire of 1871 left 100,000 residents, a third of the city, homeless. Donald L. Miller, professor of history at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania and author of ''City of the Century: The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America,'' said the 1871 fire, like Katrina, had a sudden and catastrophic impact, particularly on poor Irish immigrants. The federal government dispatched troops to keep order, but offered little direct assistance to victims. Churches, charities and business groups tried to fill the vacuum, but most of the displaced drifted into tent cities and shantytowns to fend for themselves, Professor Miller said. But if the fire offers few clear tips on how government should respond to Katrina, he said, it is instructive in one way: many of the evacuees stayed close to Chicago and helped rebuild it. By the late 1880's, it was the fifth-largest city in the world, a commercial hub and birthplace of a new, more muscular -- and more fireproof -- architecture. ''I don't understand the despair regarding New Orleans,'' he said. ''We rebuilt Chicago. We rebuilt Berlin and Tokyo. We can do it again.'' THE NATION: OFF THE MAP"
"For the nation's oil refiners, Hurricane Katrina was a disaster long in the making. Analysts and industry executives had for years feared the consequences of a storm ramming into the country's largest energy hub -- a complex infrastructure that spans most of the coastline between Texas and Alabama, where nearly half of the nation's refineries are located. Hurricane Katrina confirmed the worst predictions. Wreaking havoc along the coastal states, drowning New Orleans and leaving many dead, the storm shut down nearly all the gulf's offshore oil and gas production for over a week. Racing to restore operations, the industry has brought about 60 percent of that back. The hurricane also knocked off a dozen refineries at the peak of summer demand, sending oil prices higher and gasoline prices to inflation-adjusted records. The events of the last two weeks have demonstrated how close to the edge the country's refining system had been operating, even before the storm. Because the last American refinery was built nearly 30 years ago -- with only a single new one now in the works -- the problem is unlikely to disappear quickly. As a consequence, even though crude oil prices have fallen back to pre-Katrina levels, prices for gasoline, heating oil, diesel and jet fuel are expected to remain higher than they were before the storm for a much longer period of time. ''There is now a greater realization that we don't have much extra capacity,'' said Edward H. Murphy, a refining specialist at the American Petroleum Institute, a trade and lobbying group. ''It doesn't take a Katrina, but even a smaller event can create a dislocation in the market. Disasters like this can give you a billboard on the need to address this. We need more capacity.'' The rapid run-up in oil prices over the last two years has translated into a boon for refiners after many years of meager returns. This year, the refining margin -- the difference between the cost of buying crude oil and selling refined end products -- has exceeded $20 a barrel, far above the long-term average of $6. That has meant record profits for oil companies and refiners and above-average stock performance on Wall Street. With profits soaring, the nation's refiners are now being blamed by many drivers and politicians for contributing to the run-up in prices. Indeed, to critics of the industry, the higher profits are evidence of a policy to intentionally limit refining capacity to improve the bottom line. ''Oil companies have jacked up gasoline prices through a simple mechanism: reducing inventories and refining capacity,'' said Jamie Court, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, an advocacy group, whose views are widely shared by industry opponents. ''They are supposed to compete and bring the lowest price to consumers,'' Mr. Court said. ''But the truth is that a small number of oil companies cheat by working together by artificially reducing supplies.'' But that argument misses the point, said Bob Slaughter, the president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association. ''What's happened can be explained by the higher cost of crude oil, the difficulties in building new refineries and the disaster that cut right through the heart of the industry,'' Mr. Slaughter said. Currently, four major refineries, owned by Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Murphy Oil, are either flooded or without power, and are likely to be out of commission for several weeks, perhaps months. Together, these refine 880,000 barrels a day, or 5 percent of domestic capacity. ''It's very significant,'' said Colm McDermott, an oil analyst at John S. Herold Inc. The loss is equal to 1 percent of the world's refining capacity. ''It's a global market and that's certainly enough to have an impact on a global level.'' As many as 15 other refineries, also affected by the storm, are resuming production, but some are still operating at limited capacity. ''There's going to be a lot of pressure on these people to get things up and running and deal with the maintenance issues as they come up,'' said James W. Jones, a vice president at Turner, Mason & Company, a refining consultancy in Dallas. Many parts of the industry are recovering rapidly. The most damage offshore was sustained by Royal Dutch Shell, which said Friday that its production, usually about 450,000 barrels a day, would be down by 40 percent through the end of the year. But even as oil and gas production returns in the gulf, the time that it will take refineries to get back to full speed will be a key factor in determining how long product prices will remain elevated. Under normal conditions, because of the close proximity of volatile materials, high pressure and fire, restarting a refinery is a dangerous process that can take anywhere between three to seven days. In the refinery, oil is heated to around 1,110 degrees Fahrenheit, turned into vapor and then collected at various temperatures, creating products that are further refined to remove impurities, allowing for the production of gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel and kerosene. For the four damaged refineries -- three are in the vicinity of New Orleans, and the fourth is in Pascagoula, Miss. -- restarting will involve a much longer process. First, power must be restored. Once that happens, generators, pumps and other electrical equipment flooded by brackish water will need to be dried out. Removing salt sediments will add to the ordeal. Then the operators must check that none of their main systems have suffered any structural damage before firing them back up. So far, none of the refineries have provided an estimate of how long all that will take. In its latest report, Chevron, whose 325,000 barrels-a-day refinery is the largest of the four, said ''it will be days before a full estimate of damage is known or when operations can be safely brought back online.'' Most Americans now pay more than $3 a gallon for gasoline -- matching inflation-adjusted highs reached after the Iranian revolution in the late 1970's and early 1980's and the equivalent, on a per-barrel basis, to $126. Oil prices, which touched a high of $70.85 a barrel last week, now trade around $64 a barrel, still about $20 short of the record set in 1981. ''If we lose three or four refiners for two or three months, that shortfall is going to be very difficult to make up,'' said William E. Greehey, the chief executive of Valero, the nation's largest independent refiner. ''I don't know how anyone can blame it on us when we've just had the worst natural disaster in the United States' history.'' The refining outages prompted an international response from industrialized nations to send emergency stocks of oil and gasoline to the United States to plug the shortfall. But that is only a temporary solution to a crisis that has been waiting to erupt for years. Since the 1980's, the number of refiners in the United States has been cut in half. From a peak of 324 in 1981, the industry has shrunk to 149 as the smaller, less efficient and less profitable operators once protected by price controls closed, leaving mostly larger companies in place. Refining capacity has fallen about 10 percent, to 17 million barrels a day, while oil consumption rose by 33 percent over the same 24-year period, to 20.8 million barrels a day. Meanwhile, refiners have been increasing their skill in turning crude into useful products; efficiency improved by 27 percent between 1981 and 2004. Still, the difference must be made up by direct imports of refined products, with gasoline imports now at 1 million barrels a day. As their numbers dwindled, most remaining refiners expanded their plants and added equipment to process more oil. Many refiners now typically run at 95 percent of capacity, a level that is dangerously high and that has led to a growing number of accidents in recent years. In March, for example, a blast at BP's Texas City refinery, the country's third-largest, killed 15 and injured 170 people. The company was blamed by investigators with the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for ''systemic lapses.'' Following the agency's recommendation, BP appointed an independent panel last month to review the ''safety culture'' of its American refining operations. Only one project to build a new refinery is currently under way. For the last six years, Glenn McGinnis said he has been struggling to line up the permits, funding and oil supplies to build a refinery from scratch in a remote patch in Southwest Arizona. ''The fundamental reason why there has not been a new refinery built for years is really two reasons -- economics and uncertainty,'' Mr. McGinnis said. Traditionally, the profit margin for refineries has averaged about 6 percent, a rate of return too low to encourage much new investment. Added to that is the lengthy process involved in securing the permits from state and federal agencies. ''If you take permits, and engineering, and building,'' Mr. McGinnis said, ''you're talking about a 10-year horizon from the time you decide to build to the day the refinery is completed.'' Another issue that has slowed expansion, refiners said, was the cost of complying with environmental regulations set in the 1990's under the Clean Air Act. The American Petroleum Institute estimates that refiners have spent $47 billion over the last decade to meet carbon-emission standards and low-sulfur regulations, with more investments needed through 2007. That, refiners say, is money not spent to raise capacity. It has been cheaper to add refining capacity through acquisitions rather than new projects. Valero recently bought Premcor for $10,000 a barrel of capacity, a price many analysts deemed high. But that is well below the $16,000 a barrel that Arizona Clean Fuels, Mr. McGinnis' project, expects to invest. Elsewhere in the world, some oil producers are planning to build new refineries. Saudi Arabia is one of them. ''We cannot keep producing oil with no refineries,'' Ali Al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, told the industry newsletter Petroleum Argus a few months ago. ''There is a limit.'' While helpful, such moves abroad would mostly serve to shift the country's increasing reliance on foreign oil producers to a greater dependence on refiners abroad. ''We are going to be importing more products,'' Mr. Murphy of the American Petroleum Institute said. ''That is a certainty if we don't expand our capacity. But the problem there is that you've changed one form of dependency for another.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ENERGY Correction: September 23, 2005, Friday An article on Sept. 11 about the consequences of a hurricane on the energy industry along the coast from Texas to Alabama referred incorrectly to the status of a safety panel to review refining operations at BP after an explosion at its Texas City plant. While BP announced its plan for a panel, no committee has yet been appointed."
"The next killer hurricane that hits Long Island will give far more warning than the last one, which came ashore at Westhampton Beach on Sept. 21, 1938, and scoured the East End like a firehose trained on a sandbox. It shattered houses, scattered boats and trees, opened the breaches that became Shinnecock Inlet and Shinnecock Canal, and killed more than 50 people, none of whom had seen the monster coming. We don't have that excuse today. The question is whether, given advances in weather forecasting, our knowledge of the way storms work, and fresh memories of Hurricane Katrina, we have the foresight and will to make sure that the next Big One does as little damage as possible. The news on Long Island is not uniformly encouraging. The United States Army Corps of Engineers knows what it wants to do to bolster the southern shore from Coney Island to Montauk, but its projects exist mostly on drawing boards. The corps has an ambitious plan, for example, to reinforce an acutely vulnerable spot -- the City of Long Beach, the most densely populated barrier island in Nassau or Suffolk. For a while, the project was resisted because of aesthetic concerns -- a huge dune that would block the ocean view from the city's famous boardwalk -- and worries that dredging offshore sand to build the dune would ruin surfing conditions. Since then, the corps has come up with a plan to tuck the dune under the boardwalk, which would preserve the view while still protecting the city, and to dredge sand in a way that preserves the offshore slope that gives Long Beach surfers the waves they crave. The corps says that the newly placed dune will protect the city just as well, although the boardwalk itself will be more vulnerable. That is a reasonable compromise; the priority now should be to build the thing. The rest of Long Island's south shore, from Fire Island to Montauk, would also be fortified, but would get nothing like the level of protection provided by the Long Beach project. Multimillion-dollar homes built in West Hampton Dunes, for example, which was the beneficiary of a 1993 dune-rebuilding project, would almost certainly disappear in a Katrina-size storm. That is fitting, since the proper priority should be saving lives, not the luxury properties of rich people with insurance. Evacuation is the biggest challenge. Particularly on Long Beach and Fire Island, officials need to have clear, well-established plans for getting people to leave when the warning sounds -- very early, in the case of Fire Island, since ferries won't be able to evacuate people once the waves get big. The Katrina tragedy shows the critical importance of rounding up stragglers -- residents who want to ride out the storm; people who are old, sick and vulnerable; those without cars. This, ultimately, may be among Katrina's positive legacies: while very few on Long Island remember the great storm of 67 years ago, everyone has seen the horrors in Louisiana and Mississippi. The dead lying in the streets of New Orleans were not abstractions or computer-generated models. They will serve us well when the next storm hits, banishing complacency and affirming the realization that storms can kill. At least we hope so. This sense of awe -- mocked every time a TV reporter does a frivolous standup in a rain slicker for the evening news -- is something we in the hurricane zone urgently need. Long-term predictions about the weather are impossible, of course, but it has been nearly 70 years since the ''Long Island Express'' of 1938, and as people in Louisiana and Mississippi can tell you, luck does not last forever.

"MY earliest memory is from a hurricane. On June 27, 1957, when I was not yet 3, Audrey scythed through my town, Eunice, in southwestern Louisiana, and I recall a child's delight at the tinker-toy sprawl of fallen trees. My parents have graver memories of the storm, which killed nearly 400: howling winds strong enough, even through the walls of our house, to blow out a candle as my mother changed my sister's diaper; the bucking of my father's Pontiac as we fled to my grandmother's; the tin roof of her home peeling back like a can of Vienna sausage. Later, in a sturdier house, we would fill the bathtub with water as hurricanes approached, then gather in the hallway when rain blew in sideways under the windowsills. Labor Day always seemed a vulnerable time. Even now, I associate the Jerry Lewis Telethon with boarded windows. But since Katrina devastated New Orleans, those storms seem almost quaint. Audrey, Camille and the rest are now just cartoon names, like Betty and Veronica. New Orleans is eerie, surreal in its day-the-earth-stood-still vacancy. The Superdome roof is peeled like some metallic mushroom. A joy-ride permissiveness allows drivers to navigate flooded and obstructed streets in any direction. Bodies are left at curbs, as if for mortal recycling, some tied to stop signs and telephone poles so they won't float away. A starving dog chews on a plastic bottle in the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel. A Shetland pony grazes on a levee at Lake Pontchartrain. A car on Jefferson Highway has an umbrella stuffed in the shattered driver's window to hold out the rain. Nearly a third of the New Orleans police force walked away because of fear or anger or despair, but those who stayed worked tirelessly to rescue the living, circles of sweat under their arms, circles of fatigue under their eyes. And they gathered, as did firefighters and soldiers and volunteer rescuers, to tell stories that were mordantly funny and heartbreakingly sad. A day after Katrina struck, said Sgt. Troy McConnell of the Louisiana State Police, two men in the Lower Ninth Ward declined at first to be rescued by boat because they wanted a helicopter ride. Sergeant McConnell also recalled a woman in the Lower Ninth Ward who begged to take a digital clock with her because she would not feel safe unless she knew what time it was and what day it was. She clung to the clock as if it were her child, the sergeant said. Capt. Victor Lacava of the New Orleans fire department told of an elderly woman who stood on a table, water up to her chest, and held onto her husband's body as rescuers arrived, refusing to let go even in death. And he told of a family separated in the same house, those on the second floor listening to sounds of pounding from below until the water rose and the pounding stopped. I rode on a boat with Stanley Patrick, an ironworker turned rescuer, who searched a flooded house and found an 83-year-old dead man floating in his bedroom. On the ride back, Mr. Patrick fidgeted with a pen, twisting it in his hands as if struggling with something that he could not open or close. On Sept. 1, three days after Katrina hit, I ran into William Marshall, 30, a welder and carpenter, who was riding his mountain bike along the Highway 3127. His hotel was closing, so he decided to pedal his way to safety in Baton Rouge, 70 miles away. He wore a striped bathing suit, a T-shirt and slip-on sneakers and carried a backpack with a change of clothes, several dozen candy bars, a bottle of water, keys, a pen, a DVD of ''National Treasure'' and earplugs. ''When you stay in a shelter, you always get people snoring,'' Mr. Marshall said, adding that the movie was a rental. ''I'll return it in Baton Rouge,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''I don't think Blockbuster will mind.'' Later that afternoon, along deserted St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans, John Lee, 25, a graduate finance student at Tulane University, walked by with his mother, Fanny. Mr. Lee, from Vancouver, had only arrived in New Orleans in July. He wore a Montreal Expos cap, a Budweiser T-shirt and flip-flops. He carried an Elizabeth Arden shoulder bag filled water and cookies. This was their first hurricane, Mr. Lee said. They had been stranded in his second-floor apartment, without television or even a workable phone, for two days until they were rescued by a man in a canoe. The Lees had been so isolated that they had no idea how crippled the city had become. Mr. Lee asked whether they could get a taxi to the airport for a flight to Houston or Los Angeles. ''Has this received a lot of national attention?'' he asked. Flood Journal"
"Somehow, he managed to sleep at night. But in the three feverish weeks he catered to the needs of hurricane victims, Refael Eizraelov never really got a break. ''Everything you do during the days, it's still alive during your dreams,'' said Mr. Eizraelov, a 28-year-old native of Jerusalem. Finally, after two hurricanes and volunteer work in two cities, he rested this week. ''I feel very good,'' he said Tuesday by telephone from his home, the Austin apartment he shares with his wife, who was raised in Texas. ''Today was the first day in which I woke up, called friends in Israel, checked e-mails.'' Mr. Eizraelov, who is unemployed and waiting to get his green card, drove to Houston a few days after Hurricane Katrina to help the bedraggled arrivals from New Orleans. ''In the beginning, I was serving food in the Astrodome, sorting piles of clothing and shoes, things people donate,'' he said. His mother-in-law, Dr. Mary Gasal, an obstetrician-gynecologist, assisted in the triage area, he said, and Mr. Eizraelov became a ''runner,'' shepherding the sick to doctors gathered inside the stadium. ''I carried a few babies with fever,'' he said in a thick accent. ''You can feel them when you carry them. They were very hot and dizzy.'' Mr. Eizraelov is used to challenges. He served in the Israeli Army, and cared for his ill mother before her death from cancer three years ago; his father, he says, was abusive and dealt drugs. ''You learn in the Israeli Army that there are situations you need to solve,'' he said. ''There's nothing that's hard or easy. It depends on how much you're willing to do.'' After a few days in Houston, Mr. Eizraelov decided to work closer to home, with the American Red Cross at the Austin Convention Center. Several hundred evacuees with special needs -- those in wheelchairs, the blind, the elderly and some with mental illnesses -- had to be identified, tracked and checked every half-hour, said Mr. Eizraelov, who headed the operation. He would start at 7 a.m. and get home after 10 p.m., exhausted. ''I would be watching 'The Daily Show,''' he said, ''and that's when my eyes would turn off.'' His wife, Sarah Mogab, would drag him to bed, a process he described by using the Hebrew verb ''legared.'' His translation: ''To scrape something off the floor.'' Last weekend Mr. Eizraelov turned to helping evacuees from Hurricane Rita. But he took a break at several points to accompany his wife and mother-in-law to the Austin City Limits Music Festival. ''That's something I cannot say no to,'' he said sheepishly. ''If you're going to say no, it's a family incident.'' NATHAN LEVY STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"When Alphonso D. Thomas spotted Amelia Lavergne sitting in the shelter here on Tuesday afternoon, he said, he immediately recognized the look. The slumped shoulders from exhaustion. The red eyes from crying for missing relatives. The frustration of having her worldly belongings tucked under her small cot. It was the same gloom he felt when he first arrived here from New Orleans almost a month ago, three days after Hurricane Katrina came through the city. Mr. Thomas, 33, said he walked over, put his hand on Ms. Lavergne's shoulder and told her the most reassuring thing he could. ''It's O.K., honey,'' he recalled saying. ''I know how you feel.'' Mr. Thomas is by now a veteran evacuee. Ms. Lavergne, 54, is a newcomer, having been chased here last week by another hurricane, Rita, which ravaged her home in Lake Charles, La. A sad and unusual nexus has formed here in the center of the state, where Hurricane Katrina's power drove thousands from New Orleans, 220 miles to the southeast, and Hurricane Rita brought them from Lake Charles, 100 miles southwest. At a vacant Wal-Mart store, transformed into a sprawling shelter, the groups may look the same: they all wear fluorescent bracelets, wait in line for new toothpaste and soap, and shower in a rented truck outside the building. They have uncertainty and exhaustion in common, but talking to people from both groups is similar to hearing from two distantly related tribes that have been put together by chance to mentor, console and befriend each other. They all have long lists of frustrations that compete with what nearly all of them call their blessing. ''Thank the Lord we are alive,'' Ms. Lavergne said. A man from New Orleans responded with an amen. Over the last several days, the New Orleans evacuees have become teachers to those who left their homes in Lake Charles. Some of the advice is practical: how to file claims with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which of the Red Cross volunteers are most helpful, directions to the best diners in town. But mostly, when the two groups talk, the conversation centers on the inextricable bond they share. The veterans tell the newcomers to call themselves survivors, not victims. They should think of themselves not as refugees, or even as evacuees, but as guests in this shelter, where decent food and fresh clothing are the least they deserve. They should remember that they did not ask to be here. The Hurricane Katrina survivors tell the new arrivals that they should make themselves at home in their temporary living quarters, with coffee makers or small televisions or by just arranging their beds into clusters for makeshift rooms. ''You don't know how long you'll be here, so might as well get comfortable,'' Mr. Thomas said. It gave Ms. Lavergne a little comfort to hear that Mr. Thomas had been able to track down all 25 of the relatives he initially thought were missing after Hurricane Katrina. A few hours after talking with him, she found out where the rest of her family was. ''My mama is in Mississippi, my daughter left and went with her mother-in-law in Houston, my baby girl is in Dallas, my other baby is in Texarkana,'' she said, sitting on a cot covered with her favorite green blanket from home. ''All I need now is to see my people. I'm fine. We all want to go home. It seems like I have been here forever. Theyre treating us good over here, but I just want to go home.'' Those from the southwest part of the state crowd around the wide-screen televisions to look for pictures of their homes that might pop up on the latest newscast about Hurricane Rita. Those who have been here longer warn that such attentiveness is futile. ''I just can't watch it all the time, it is so depressing,'' said Amy Carr, 61, an evacuee from New Orleans East whose bed faces the largest of the half-dozen televisions in the shelter. Searching for pictures of their homes on the Internet, pointing out which house was smashed by a tree and which apartment building's roof was ripped off, the Hurricane Rita evacuees still make plans to return as soon as possible. But the Hurricane Katrina victims have largely abandoned their optimism. Few of them say they have plans to return. STORM AND CRISIS: SHELTERS"
"Billions of dollars in municipal bonds helped build New Orleans and the surrounding areas hit by Hurricane Katrina. Now, the municipal bond market is warily watching to see whether this natural disaster could turn into a municipal finance one as well. Four large municipal bond insurers disclosed yesterday that they had a combined exposure of $14 billion. MBIA, Ambac and the Financial Guaranty Insurance Corporation had $4 billion each, while the Financial Services Authority had exposure of $2 billion. The insurers step in if the municipalities cannot make payments on their outstanding debt because of a loss of revenue -- whether because of empty hotels or homes that may have to be razed. ''All the major sources of revenue collections will be under deep stress,'' said Richard Larkin, an analyst at J.B. Hanauer, the bond brokerage firm in Parsippany, N.J. ''The city is dependent on sales taxes and on property taxes. And that is depending on some retail activity taking place -- and it isn't.'' Standard & Poor's, a rating agency that assesses municipal creditworthiness, has put municipal debt from Louisiana and Mississippi on its credit watch list ''This is not meant to predict a downgrade, but it is to focus on the uncertainty,'' said Alex Fraser, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. Two mainstays of the local economy, tourism and casinos, have been lost, and any drop in oil and gas revenues from damage to offshore rigs will also strain municipalities. Unlike other hurricanes, which mainly damaged houses, Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage to the region's economic base. ''We are entering into uncharted territory,'' said Steven Murray, an analyst with Fitch Investors Services, a bond rating agency. ''I suspect we will be dealing with issues that no one has thought of before. If whole neighborhoods will be razed, what does that mean for tax purposes?'' For instance, $500 million in bonds for the Ernest Morial Convention Center in New Orleans as well as statewide bonds supporting the Superdome are backed by a hotel tax -- and the hotels in the city are expected to remain closed for a long time. Some $200 million in New Orleans water and sewer bonds are backed by taxpayer revenues. Bonds issued by universities and hospitals are backed by student tuition and hospital revenue. In some areas of Mississippi and Alabama, where houses and casinos have been destroyed, Mr. Larkin said some municipalities might not be revived. ''Will there be a reason to come back, when the entire tax base is wiped out?'' he asked. While federal emergency aid is expected to provide relief, it is not expected to be enough to cover all of the costs. Nor does it help municipalities with existing obligations. In many cases, some existing municipal debt is backed by reserve funds. But typically, the reserve funds cover only one year's debt service obligations. For that reason, Mr. Larkin said New Orleans, in particular, might face a number of options. If the debt becomes overwhelming, it can declare bankruptcy and have its repayment schedule delayed. It is possible, as happened in the case of the New York City financial crisis in 1975, that the federal government could step in. And the State of Louisiana may have to shoulder more. ''In traditional distressed situations,'' Mr. Larkin said, ''the state has to come in and put the guys on its back and carry them for a while.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE BOND MARKET"
"Emile Ozerden drove 70 miles Wednesday night on a tip that there was gas in Mobile, only to discover that the stations with gas had no power to pump it. When she finally found fuel, in Biloxi, she couldn't wait -- the line was too long, and she feared she would miss curfew here. At 6 a.m. Thursday, as soon as curfew broke, she started out for ice and water. She went first to the mall, where the police told her to go to the parking lot at Hoods; she waited in line there for more than an hour, only to be told that the trucks would be another four hours. She was driving to her brother's house when she saw an emergency supply truck under police escort doling out bags of ice and water along Pass Road. ''You see a white truck, follow it!'' said Howard Waugh, her neighbor in the line where she now waited with a cooler and her two small children. Life for them and others here on the devastated coast of Mississippi has become a giant scavenger hunt for the most basic necessities. With debris covering streets, no electricity and most stores closed, lines several miles long formed for gasoline, for food, for water and ice that often did not arrive as promised. People lined up for medicine and for generators and at banks, because the few places that were open were taking only cash, and without phone signals, A.T.M.'s were not working. When a couple of cellphone stores reopened to offer free phone calls, lines appeared there, too. Radio stations gave frequent clues: ''The B.P. near the truck stop just got a truck of gas,'' one announced Thursday afternoon. After a false report Wednesday morning, several police cars drove with bullhorns along a milelong line of cars near the Wal-Mart on Route 49. ''Wal-Mart is not open! Turn around!'' they boomed. ''Wal-Mart is not open!'' Thursday, Chasity Smith had come to the bank with her sister-in-law to get in line and saw that a Domino's pizza had opened, so she dropped her sister-in-law to get food for the 18 people -- five families -- living in her mother-in-law's three-bedroom house. Within 10 minutes 30 people were lined up there.. Closer to Mobile, more stores were open. But for gas there were lines across the entire southern part of the state -- if there was gas at all. People ran out of gas waiting to get gas. At the Kangaroo gas station here, Mark Ostoits, the division director for stations in the area, said he had pushed 20 cars in the past three hours. Of 30 stations in the region, he said, this was the only one open. ''People are trying to cut in line, but other people report them and we kick them out,'' Mr. Ostoits said. ''Everybody's got to be patient.'' Water was the most sought-after necessity. But other things, too, were hard to find. Catherine Nickoles was in line with her 6-month-old son and her mother, Cherri, at a CVS drugstore, waiting to buy formula. ''He hasn't had anything but water since Tuesday night,'' Catherine Nickoles said. The line inched along as the manager let in customers one by one, telling each they had just five minutes to buy what they wanted in the darkened store. Five hours later, the Nickoles had their formula. With temperatures rising, people bought umbrellas to shield themselves for the long waits. But tempers were running high. At the Federal Emergency Management Agency distribution center on Pass Road, fights broke out around 8:30 a.m., after people in a line that had been forming since 5 a.m. were told that trucks would not be there until 10. The city pulled the police off street patrol to do crowd control. Among many people there was desperation. ''What's this for?'' JoAnn Smith, a nurse's assistant asked, running up to the line at CVS. ''I need some gas. Where can I find gas?'' Told that there was some in Biloxi, she said, ''I don't have enough to get there.'' Jim Fullilove, 52, had come to CVS at 7:30 a.m. after the gas line he had tried to get into backed up onto the Interstate. He thought he would fill a prescription, but when the store opened two hours later he was told it was not dispensing any. ''I don't need anything else,'' Mr. Fullilove said, ''but I've been in line so long I'm going to get some stuff anyway. Perhaps some bug repellent.'' At Lowe's home improvement store, Jim Scaies was about to go inside to buy a generator after waiting in line for two hours. The day before he had spent $4.25 a gallon for gas at a station that was offering only racing fuel. But he was happy because along the way he saw a store with signs saying: Free Phone Calls. So he stopped and called his son in New York to tell him he was all right. ''In Britain they say people will start a queue behind anyone who stops on the sidewalk,'' Mr. Scaies said. ''It's become like that here. You see somebody, you get in line to see what they've got.'' Others did not bother to wait in line, climbing through blown-out windows and over plywood into stores to loot them. At Gulfport Discount Cigarettes, where looters rushed out with cases of water, soda and cigarettes, the manager had told the police not to stop them. Chris Baker, a city police officer, said, ''He said there's no sense spending our time arresting them. Everything's a complete loss anyway.'' Others had less patience with such behavior. The state's insurance commissioner, George Dale, said on the radio Tuesday that he believed looters should be shot. Others agreed. ''Owner In Store W/Gun,'' read a sign outside Rodeo's Boot Outlet, a cavernous store with the front blown off. Radio stations, some of them simply running the audio of television news coverage that few people had power to watch, were the source of most of the tips, and some of the misinformation. ''We are dispensing reliable information,'' one station said. ''However, things can hold up trucks. Please be patient.'' But people were grumbling that many of the reports were wrong. ''TV and radio are just feeding the rumors,'' grumbled Mr. Fullilove, in line at CVS. Still, he was not inclined to disregard them completely. ''The Church of God on 29th is going to give free meals, ice and water,'' he said. ''At least they said.'' STORM AND CRISIS: SCAVENGERS"
"IN camouflage, rifle at his side, all through the night the National Guardsman leans against the Humvee at the entrance to my block, checking identifications of passers-by. I live along hurricane-smashed Mobile Bay, across from the city of Mobile, and some boats are beached nearby. I realize that this citizen-soldier, who also bears the Iraq war on his shoulders, is here to keep order, but like the armed guardsman pacing in front of the jam-packed local gas station, he seems menacing. When I return home, I show him my driver's license. ''Have a good one,'' he says, waving me on. Finally, I relax. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, parts of our coastal communities churn with chaos, but others draw closer together. It's true that people are smashing store windows in New Orleans. But it's also true that with most of the traffic lights still out in my area, people stop and yield on their own at potentially murderous intersections. I have visited with people weeping for their losses along the Gulf Coast of Alabama. On a transistor radio in my powerless home, I've heard the wail of humanity from our neighbors just to the west. But I have also heard compassionate restraint. I've seen nobody on our stretch of the Alabama coast either celebrating that the eye went wide of us or complaining about our losses. From downtown Mobile, where small-business owners mopped up after being flooded, to the Point Clear boardwalk, where the owners of 19th-century bay houses picked through the debris of wrecked porches, to a neighborhood near Mobile's Dog River, where water-logged furniture baked in the sun, everyone I talked to echoed the sentiment: ''We just feel for our neighbors and friends in Mississippi and Louisiana.'' And we are, indeed, neighbors. Although we vote in four states, Pensacola, Mobile, Gulfport-Biloxi, and New Orleans make up a 51st state of the Gulf Coast. We share our history, shipping and seafood; our Hurricanes Ivan and Dennis and Katrina. Folks from New Orleans vacation on Mobile Bay; we go to New Orleans for the day to roam the French Quarter. I studied at Tulane. We have dinner at the Biloxi casinos, pull a few slots, marvel at the antebellum homes. When I talk to people along the roads about this hurricane and others, I ask if there is any lesson to be learned. We will hear, in coming days, debates on the political lessons of having so many people, of little means, trapped in our cities; management lessons about handling public emergencies; financial lessons about flood insurance; engineering lessons about shoring up waterfronts; religious lessons drawn from every denomination's view of God's will and man's willpower. But perhaps the most powerful lesson is one that was offered to me earlier this week by a 23-year-old Mexican migrant worker I interviewed at a rural shelter the afternoon Katrina roared through. He was working in construction in our area, having followed the demand for labor after Hurricane Ivan. The ''huracán,'' he said in Spanish, using the term based on the name of the Mayan god of wind, fire and rain, shows us ''that it is big, and we are small.'' How big we can be as a community is the next question. Op-Ed Contributor Roy Hoffman, a staff writer for The Mobile Register, is the author of ''Chicken Dreaming Corn,'' a novel."
"THE deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina are heart-rending. The suffering of survivors is wrenching. Property destruction is shocking. But perhaps the most agonizing part is that much of what happened in New Orleans this week might have been avoided. Watching the TV images of the storm approaching the Mississippi Delta on Sunday, I was sick to my stomach. Not only because I knew the hell it could unleash (I wrote an article for Scientific American in 2001 that described the very situation that was unfolding) but because I knew that a large-scale engineering plan called Coast 2050 -- developed in 1998 by scientists, Army engineers, metropolitan planners and Louisiana officials -- might have helped save the city, but had gone unrealized. The debate over New Orleans's vulnerability to hurricanes has raged for a century. By the late 1990's, scientists at Louisiana State University and the University of New Orleans had perfected computer models showing exactly how a sea surge would overwhelm the levee system, and had recommended a set of solutions. The Army Corps of Engineers, which built the levees, had proposed different projects. Yet some scientists reflexively disregarded practical considerations pointed out by the Army engineers; more often, the engineers scoffed at scientific studies indicating that the basic facts of geology and hydrology meant that significant design changes were needed. Meanwhile, local politicians lobbied Congress for financing for myriad special interest groups, from oil companies to oyster farmers. Congress did not hear a unified voice, making it easier to turn a deaf ear. Fed up with the splintered efforts, Len Bahr, then the head of the Louisiana Governor's Office of Coastal Activities, somehow dragged all the parties to one table in 1998 and got them to agree on a coordinated solution: Coast 2050. Completing every recommended project over a decade or more would have cost an estimated $14 billion, so Louisiana turned to the federal government. While this may seem an astronomical sum, it isn't in terms of large public works; in 2000 Congress began a $7 billion engineering program to refresh the dying Florida Everglades. But Congress had other priorities, Louisiana politicians had other priorities, and the magic moment of consensus was lost. Thus, in true American fashion, we ignored an inevitable problem until disaster focused our attention. Fortunately, as we rebuild New Orleans, we can protect it -- by engineering solutions that work with nature, not against it. The conceit that we can control the natural world is what made New Orleans vulnerable. For more than a century the Army Corps, with Congress's blessing, leveed the Mississippi River to prevent its annual floods, so that farms and industries could expand along its banks. Those same floods, however, had dumped huge amounts of sediment and freshwater across the Mississippi Delta, rebuilding each year what gulf tides and storms had worn away and holding back infusions of saltwater that kill marsh vegetation. These vast delta wetlands created a lush, hardy buffer that could absorb sea surges and weaken high winds. The flooding at the river's mouth also sent great volumes of sediment west and east into the Gulf of Mexico, to a string of barrier islands that cut down surges and waves, compensating for regular ocean erosion. Stopping the Mississippi's floods starved the wetlands and the islands; both are rapidly disintegrating, leaving the city naked against the sea. What can we do to restore these natural protections? Although the parties that devised Coast 2050, and other independent scientists and engineers who have floated rival plans, may disagree on details, they do concur on several major initiatives that would shield New Orleans, reconstitute the delta and, as a side benefit, improve ports and shipping lanes for the oil and natural gas industries in the Gulf of Mexico. Cut several channels in the levees on the Mississippi River's southern bank (the side that doesn't abut the city) and secure them with powerful floodgates that could be opened at certain times of the year to allow sediment and freshwater to flow down into the delta, re-establishing it. Build a new navigation channel from the Gulf into the Mississippi, about 40 miles south of New Orleans, so ships don't have to enter the river at its three southernmost tips 30 miles further away. For decades the corps has dredged shipping channels along those final miles to keep them navigable, creating underwater chutes that propel river sediment out into the deep ocean. The dredging could then be stopped, the river mouth would fill in naturally, and sediment would again spill to the barrier islands, lengthening and widening them. Some planners also propose a modern port at the new access point that would replace those along the river that are too shallow to handle the huge new ships now being built worldwide. Erect huge seagates across the pair of narrow straits that connect the eastern edge of Lake Pontchartrain, which lies north of the city, to the gulf. Now, any hurricane that blows in from the south will push a wall of water through these straits into the huge lake, which in turn will threaten to overflow into the city. That is what has filled the bowl that is New Orleans this week. But seagates at the straits can stop the wall of water from flowing in. The Netherlands has built similar gates to hold back the turbulent North Sea and they work splendidly. Finally, and most obviously, raise, extend and strengthen the city's existing but aging levees, canal walls and pumping systems that worked so poorly in recent days. It's hard to say how much of this work could have been completed by today had Coast 2050 become a reality. Certainly, the delta wetlands and barrier islands would not have rebounded substantially yet. But undoubtedly progress would have been made that would have spared someone's life, someone's home, some jazz club or gumbo joint, some city district, some part of the region's unique culture that the entire country revels in. And we would have been well on our way to a long-term solution. For there is one thing we know for sure: hurricanes will howl through the Mississippi Delta again.

"As federal flood-control officials directed efforts to block the 17th Street Canal, the source of most of the water swamping New Orleans, they faced growing criticism yesterday over decades of missed opportunities to prevent precisely this type of disaster. In interviews and a telephone conference call with reporters, senior officials and engineers from up and down the ranks of the Army Corps of Engineers conceded that they had no ability to detect quickly small breaches in the matrix of 350 miles of levees around New Orleans. Unless such holes can be blocked early, the water will almost invariably rip away at the edges, widening the breach. The officials and engineers said that after they had found the widening gap in the concrete wall on the eastern side of the canal, they had no quick-response plan to repair it. Even as they tried to improvise a solution while water continued to pour into neighborhood after neighborhood, their efforts were hampered by a lack of heavy helicopters, most of which had been dispatched by federal emergency officials to rescue stranded residents. ''The first priority of the rotary-winged aircraft was to rescue people,'' Lt. Gen. Carl A. Strock, commander of the corps, said in the conference call. ''Plugging the gap was a lower priority.'' The accumulation of 40 years of compromises of that sort resulted in a mixture of grief, frustration and defensiveness from the corps, which has long been given a mission far broader than its budget. Ultimately, the corps is directed, along with 15 other agencies, by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''It is FEMA who is really calling the shots and setting priorities here,'' General Strock said. He defended the Bush administration against the charge that spending on the war in Iraq had diminished the capacity to deal with domestic threats like the hurricane. ''I do not see that to be the case,'' General Strock said. ''We deeply regret the loss of life associated with this. We are committed to doing whatever we can right now to stop the flow of waters and get the city on the road to recovery.'' Alfred C. Naomi, a senior project manager in the New Orleans district of the corps, said the New Orleans protection system was a vexing mix. It met the standards that were agreed on long ago, but was known to be inadequate. ''This storm was much greater than protection we were authorized to provide,'' Mr. Naomi said. Current and former local officials expressed anger at the lack of preparedness. ''I'm just shocked,'' said Martha Madden, who was the Louisiana secretary of environmental quality in the late 1980's and is now a consultant in strategic planning in Washington and New Orleans. The Corps of Engineers, Ms. Madden said, should have arranged access to supplies like sandbags and concrete barriers, the way environmental planners reserve access to materials for oil spills. ''You'd have all that on contract,'' she said. ''You have contractors with all those potential needs in place.'' Since 1965, when the first large federal project was started to bolster New Orleans's levees and other defenses, there has been a tug of war over how sturdy, and expensive, to make a system that might, or might not, be needed. Most aspects of the $732 million Lake Pontchartrain project have been completed, but the project remains behind schedule and underfinanced. Although Congress appropriated more than $4.7billion for the Corps of Engineers this year, the spending on New Orleans levees was relatively small. The Pontchartrain project drew about $5.7million, almost $2million more than what was earmarked for it in President Bush's budget. For five years, Congress has repeatedly increased the sum for New Orleans levees over Mr. Bush's requests, Senate Republicans' figures show. The White House on Thursday referred budget questions to the Office of Management and Budget, where officials did not return calls for comment. From the project's early days, there were vivid reasons to push for the greatest level of protection. One was Hurricane Betsy, a midgrade storm that swamped much of New Orleans in 1965. In 1969, Hurricane Camille, the second-most-powerful Atlantic storm recorded, passed within 60 miles and demolished the Mississippi coast. The initial plan was deemed robust, yet affordable, General Strock said. Government engineers and budget officials settled on designing for what meteorologists calculated would be a once-in-200-year event, he said. That would mean a storm like Hurricane Betsy, a Category 3 storm on the five-step intensity scale. General Strock said tradeoffs between costs and protection levels were a result of a ''complex process involving the intersection of a lot of people from the local, state and national level.'' Adam Hughes, an analyst at OMB Watch, said such tradeoffs erred far too often on the side of serving short-term needs and discounting long-term risks. Now, Mr. Hughes said, the devastation in New Orleans made an earlier investment in bigger berms and other protections all part of that gray universe of what bureaucrats call infrastructure look like a bargain. ''This is a classic example of what underfunding infrastructure can do,'' Mr. Hughes said. Not all of the problems leading to such a calamity lay at the federal level, said Bob Sheets, a meteorologist who directed the National Hurricane Center until retiring in 1995. Dr. Sheets said that even as a firmer understanding of the danger for New Orleans became evident in the late 70's, some local officials tended to discount the risks. At the time, Dr. Sheets and other federal forecasters ran the first computer simulations, using a program that simulated how Lake Pontchartrain and surrounding waters might behave under strikes by big storms. Much of the lake is a shallow pan where huge amounts of water can quickly pile up on a lee shore, like that facing New Orleans. The computer simulations made clear that certain storms could swamp the platterlike city, wedged between a great river and a broad lake, Dr. Sheets said, adding, ''The risk obviously in New Orleans was greater than in any other community.'' He and other federal forecasters gave hundreds of talks about storm risks, and New Orleans was always the case study for catastrophe. Dr. Sheets had many tabletop exercises with the city's emergency officials, and when a storm loomed, they always started an evacuation, in the thought experiment. But in 1992, he said, when Hurricane Andrew, just behind Hurricane Camille on the all-time intensity list, headed to the Gulf Coast, and the National Hurricane Center advised New Orleans to start evacuations, he said of the city officials: ''Essentially they did nothing. The conventions and other business went on.'' Dr. Sheets said a 20-year lull in Atlantic storm activity from 1970 until the early 90's could have contributed to communities' sense of ease. ''The longer you go without something like this, the less you think it will happen,'' he said. ''The risk was there,'' he said. ''And now, obviously, it has come to pass to a great degree.'' Mr. Naomi noted that since 2000, Congress had financed the corps request for a study to increase New Orleans's protections for the strongest hurricanes. But he acknowledged that the sum was a fraction of the request and that the study would take years to complete. ''To effectuate what would have made any difference in this storm,'' he said, such a study would have had to have started 20 or 25 years ago. STORM AND CRISIS: THE LEVEE"
"At a downtown Marathon gasoline station here, gas prices did something strange in the wake of the deadly Hurricane Katrina -- they fell 25 cents a gallon, to $3.45, for regular unleaded fuel. The dealer, Jim Klun, dropped his prices Thursday after Marathon Petroleum, the company that supplies his gasoline, admitted through a distributor Wednesday that it had increased prices too much in the confusion that has gripped gasoline suppliers and retailers all over the country since Monday's storm. Far from the devastation that caused flooding in New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast, Mr. Klun is one of many dealers caught between oil companies and angry consumers. Motorists often wonder if rapidly rising pump prices are a sign of price gouging. But dealers insist that is not necessarily the case. Typically, they keep only one to three days of supply on hand, and they claim that they have to raise prices to afford the next delivery of higher-price fuel. Service stations usually add a profit margin of 10 to 25 cents a gallon onto the wholesale price. Of course, the steep pump-price increases in the last week mean that some dealers may be tacking on a much higher profit margin. While there are no price controls, laws in some states do place general limitations on gas price increases. Dealers say they frequently take the heat for huge price increases, but most are at the mercy of large oil companies that set the price they pay for their wholesale fuel. Mr. Klun said he consistently priced 20 cents over his wholesale cost. Even with gasoline prices at $2.99 the morning of the hurricane, posting a $3.69 price on Wednesday shook him like never before. ''I've never been close to that,'' Mr. Klun said Thursday, sitting in the backroom of the gas station his family has run on the edge of the Kennedy Expressway since 1962. On Wednesday, Mr. Klun was notified by his distributor, Parent Petroleum of St. Charles, Ill., that Marathon would be paying him a 26-cents-a-gallon credit for gas he overpaid for. Across the country dealers posted eye-popping gasoline prices Thursday, reflecting panic in both dealers and consumers not seen since the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Some stations on the East Coast and in the Midwest posted prices well over $3 a gallon, putting their prices more in line with those of the West Coast, where prices have traditionally been the highest in recent years. The average price for regular unleaded spiked 6.1 cents, to $2.68 a gallon, from Wednesday to Thursday, according to AAA, the nation's largest motoring organization. Pump prices are 44 percent higher than a year ago, AAA said. But some dealers posted far crazier prices. Near Atlanta, a BP dealer charged $5.87 a gallon for regular unleaded, later telling reporters and his distributor that he panicked after almost running out a few times. Scott Dean, a spokesman for BP, said it did not condone the dealer's price. Mr. Dean said the Georgia man was an independent dealer not employed by BP and that he purchases BP gasoline from a third-party distributor. ''We did not set the price of that station,'' Mr. Dean said. In several states, including Alabama and Illinois, attorneys general said they were closely monitoring gasoline prices for signs of gouging. While some consumers are chronically suspicious of the price-setting of gasoline stations, in normal times gasoline prices are set by a combination of supply of both crude oil and gasoline and the demand for gasoline. The price of crude oil generally accounts for more than half the cost of a gallon of gasoline, with the rest of the cost being taxes, refining cost and distribution and marketing. But most of those normal rules for how gasoline is priced have been thrown out the window by the hurricane damage, several gasoline market analysts said. ''There is a lot of mass confusion,'' said Mike Burdette, an economist at the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Department of Energy. ''Everyone is protecting themselves to make sure they can afford the next load.'' Mr. Klun is an independent dealer, owning his own station and land. But he gets Marathon gasoline through Parent Petroleum, which delivers gas to more than 200 Chicago area stations, including 70 Marathon outlets. Shocked by the high price he was being charged for his gasoline, he called Parent Petroleum on Wednesday to let officials there know that the Illinois attorney general had inquired about his station's prices. Then early Thursday he was notified by Parent that he would be receiving a 26-cents-a-gallon credit. ''We apologize for all the inconvenience caused,'' wrote Peter Mancini, president of Parent Petroleum, in a memo. Mr. Mancini, in an interview, said that on Aug. 30 he got the daily price quotes from Citgo, Mobil and Marathon. Marathon had gone up 45 cents, ''like 30 cents higher than anyone else that night.'' Mr. Mancini called Marathon to ask what was wrong. After a day of back and forth, the company came back with the rebate. Only eight or nine stations had customers that bought at the highest prices, he said. ''They should be contacting the Marathons of the world,'' he said, referring to the attorney general's office. ''It's sad that the public thinks dealers are the ones making huge money.'' Prices at the Pump"
"Jean Bowling found the cheapest bottle of red wine in the Whole Foods grocery store here, hoping it would offer a momentary reprieve from the chaos that has become her life. Back in New Orleans, she might be sharing the wine with a friend in her trendy Uptown neighborhood. But here she is staying in her mother's home, her husband and children in tow. So instead of drinking the wine, she is considering just using it to cook with. Lisa Bourgeois is also doing her best to adjust to her new surroundings. The concrete and trees of Baton Rouge are a far cry from her native Mandeville, a popular destination for yachting along Lake Pontchartrain that suffered severe hurricane damage. A friend has offered Mrs. Bourgeois a spare room as long as her family needs it. But when a relative called to offer money, she said, she was ''shocked,'' because she has never been one to need a handout. ''I understood why they offered,'' Mrs. Bourgeois said. ''But it still felt strange, since I've never been in the position of needing, to think about that before.'' Like many others who have fled Hurricane Katrina and sought refuge here, these women find themselves in a foreign environment, devoid of the luxuries they once enjoyed. Gone are the cocktail parties in Uptown New Orleans, the long afternoon sails. Those accustomed to playing host now find themselves as lingering guests. Their lives have turned upside down like the devastated regions they evacuated, and they have come to a city that is buckling under the weight of its new arrivals. So many people have come that Jeff LeDuff, the police chief here, has said that city officials will no longer be able to transport and place evacuees within the city and instead they will be sent to adjacent regions. Overnight, Baton Rouge has replaced New Orleans as the most populous city in the state. And with that title come all the challenges of a booming metropolis. The Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport usually handles 700,000 passengers a year. But city officials are predicting an increase to upward of three million passengers as a result of the closing of neighboring airports. Businesses forced out of the path of destruction in other cities are gobbling up office space here. Apartment rentals are in short supply: in any typical year, there are 4,000 vacancies; currently, there are none. The same trends are being seen with home sales. ''People are buying homes with suitcases of cash,'' said Drew Tessier, a spokesman for the city. The ripple effects of this boom are putting unexpected pressure on other parts of the business community. Banks are reporting long waits for withdrawals and new accounts. Loan officers are backlogged with requests for rental deposits. The city clerk is being forced to bring in additional administrators to handle new home purchases. Estimates of how long the refugees will be staying vary. Officials say it may be four to five months, although they warn that that timeframe could change at any moment. That is a long time for houseguests and for their hosts. Martha Jane Tassin, a City Council member, is used to living alone, but her occupancy rate has gone up considerably since Hurricane Katrina blew through the coastal regions of the state. Under her roof now are 15 relatives, 4 dogs and 2 cats. Things like ice, rarely given a thought before the family invasion, are now in short order. For the time being, Ms. Tassin and her guests have limited themselves to one cube for each glass of water. ''It's going to be a long haul,'' she said. ''Everyone is sacrificing in lots of ways.'' The refugees are sacrificing, too. And for many, it is hard to swallow their pride and accept help. Mary Frost describes her long journey from Waveland, Miss., as ''uncomfortable.'' When the congregation from a Baptist church ushered her through a soup line in North Louisiana, Ms. Frost said, she felt like an impostor, not in need of such charity. ''I think people tend to be proud, and it doesn't feel right sometimes to get help,'' she said. When she arrived in Baton Rouge, Ms. Frost said , her boyfriend grumbled at the thought of buying used clothes at a thrift store, although it was economically prudent. Arman Codianne, who also left Waveland, finds himself wanting somehow to repay the hospitality he has been offered. A masseur, Mr. Codianne is staying with friends of relatives. He said he keeps offering to give a massage to anyone who wants it, but so far there have been no takers. ''I only have $200 to my name,'' he said. ''So I have to give something else to say thanks since I'll be here for a while.'' As such, evacuees like Mrs. Bowling are trying to put the pieces of their former lives back together. And on the top of the list is education for her three children. While the children once enjoyed the best private schools New Orleans had to offer, Mrs. Bowling said, she was now scrambling to get them enrolled in Baton Rouge. ''I've tried to pull my strings here,'' she said, but nothing had come through yet. The transition forced upon the evacuees has been trying, but people like Mrs. Bowling are finding ways to be resourceful like never before. ''It's some sort of self-preservation,'' she said. ''I know if I start crying I won't stop.'' STORM AND CRISIS: LOUISIANA"
"The Chandeleur Islands, a narrow string of sandy barriers in the Gulf of Mexico about 70 miles east of New Orleans, were virtually destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, according to federal researchers who flew over the area yesterday. Abby Sallenger, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey, said researchers reported that the uninhabited islands had turned into marshy outcrops, denuded of sand. By the standards of Louisiana, where coastal barriers have been suffering serious erosion for decades, the Chandeleurs, which make up most of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge, had been relatively robust, with sand dunes of perhaps six to nine feet, Dr. Sallenger said. As such, they offered some storm protection for the Louisiana coast. But measurements with a radarlike instrument called lidar show that the sand ''is just gone,'' he said. Dr. Sallenger said scientists would not know for sure what happened on the islands until they do a more thorough study with wind records, mathematical models and other data. The islands may recover somewhat with the return of calm weather, Dr. Sallenger said. The marshy sediments that remain still hold some sand, which could potentially form new dunes."
"The Labor Day holiday offers the last chance for a summer fling, and there is every sign that millions of travelers will take to the highways and the skies this weekend. But soaring gasoline prices after Hurricane Katrina and fears over gasoline supplies are causing travelers to calculate how much the trip will cost by car, whether it is cheaper to fly and how easy it will be to fill up. A few travelers are canceling their trips, while others are reconsidering the vacations they plan to take this fall. That is bad news for innkeepers, hotel chains, rental car companies and airlines, for whom the fall is traditionally a slow season until Thanksgiving arrives. A drop in business among price-conscious travelers will spell trouble for an industry that was finally recovering from the plunge in travel after the September 2001 attacks. And it is an even bigger worry for the struggling airline industry, faced with the possibility of dwindling fuel supplies in weeks to come, coupled with the need to pass along the significantly higher cost of jet fuel. Labor Day weekend is primarily a driving holiday, albeit one that is less traveled than other big summer weekends. About 28.8 million travelers will be on the road this weekend, according to the AAA, while about 4 million people will fly. Both the number of air travelers and motorists are up slightly from 2004, said Mantill Williams, a spokesman for AAA. By contrast, 30 million drivers are on the roads during the Thanksgiving holiday period, the busiest time of the year for car travel, Mr. Williams said. There is a common concern among motorists this weekend: the spiraling cost of fuel. ''Everybody's thinking about gas,'' said John Frenaye, the director of business development at the Capital Travel Center, a travel agency based in Annapolis, Md. ''When's it going to stop?'' Faced with the cost of filling up the car, paying for a hotel room and meals for the weekend, he said, ''I wouldn't be surprised if people canceled their trips.'' Nancy Showers, the owner of the 11-room Inn at New Berlin, Pa., said three sets of guests had canceled reservations for tonight, including a couple from North Carolina who called off their trip because of high gas prices. ''Usually we're booked every weekend,'' Ms. Showers said. Marilyn Freeman, an investment adviser from Stamford, Conn., is reviewing her fall travel plans in light of local gasoline prices that rose from $2.89 to $3.89 a gallon this week. To afford her vacation and business travel, ''I've considered starting to walk to work,'' said Ms. Freeman, who lives a mile and a half from her office. But she and her husband still plan to drive to Pennsylvania for college football games this fall. The round-trip fare from White Plains, which has the nearest airport, to State College, Pa., would be $460 apiece, while they can get to Pennsylvania in their Lexus sport utility on one tank of gas for $40, she said. Cities not affected by the hurricane expect plenty of visitors this weekend. The nation's top destinations for Labor Day travel, in order, are Chicago, Las Vegas, New York, Washington and Denver, according to advance bookings on Travelocity.com, a Web site specializing in travel reservations. ''That tells me Katrina is having a minimal impact on Labor Day travel,'' said Amy Ziff, a Travelocity spokeswoman. Likewise, Hilton Hotels Corporation is reporting strong demand for hotel rooms this weekend. ''The higher gas prices don't appear to be affecting bookings,'' said Kendra Walker, a spokeswoman for Hilton, which owns Hilton, Doubletree, Embassy Suites Hotels and Hampton Inn, among others. ''If it's going to cost them $20 to go from Los Angeles to San Diego, for example, they're not likely to cancel their trip and disappoint their family. They're going to go.'' Some may rent a car to do so. But these travelers should be mindful of two things: finding gas for their vehicles -- spot shortages may develop in some areas in the Midwest and Northeast -- and the price they will pay if they do not refuel before returning their cars, said Rich Broome, vice president of corporate affairs for the Hertz Corporation. Hertz charges a fee of up to $6 a gallon at some locations for refueling, he said, making this week's high gasoline prices look appealing by comparison. Some motorists bought gas well in advance of their trips. Lela Carney, of Santa Cruz, Calif., filled up her Toyota Prius on Monday, just as Katrina struck and gasoline prices reached $3 a gallon. She plans to visit Sonoma County this weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday, but after that does not plan to drive more than she has to. ''Fortunately, I can bicycle to work,'' she said. Some travelers are rationing themselves. Lily Strasburg, 21, a waitress in San Francisco, pulled into a 76 gas station located at an entrance to the Bay Bridge on Thursday to get gas on her way home. The price of unleaded regular was $3.09 a gallon. She only pumped $9 worth. These days, she rarely fills her tank, she said, just one of the ways she copes with the recent price hikes. Ms. Strasburg has a family event to attend this weekend in Santa Rosa, about 60 miles north of San Francisco, but she may back out. ''I'm debating whether to go, because it will cost me $30 to get there and back with bridge tolls.'' One place vacationers will not head this weekend is New Orleans, which normally would be filled with holiday travelers. The city is closed, and hotels in surrounding suburbs are booked solid with evacuees and rescue workers. Moreover, there is no word when Louis Armstrong Airport will reopen to regular commercial traffic. Yesterday, officials at several airlines said they expected flights there to be canceled for at least a month. The airport typically has 157 flights a day at this time of year, according to Back Aviation Solutions, a consulting firm. The biggest carrier serving the airport is Southwest Airlines, which has about a third of daily flights. Another big carrier is Delta Air Lines, whose chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, was aboard a relief flight from Atlanta that brought cots, water and supplies for rescue teams. Until the airport reopens, some airlines are considering adding service to Baton Rouge, a much smaller airport with about 28 flights a day. Airports on the East Coast, meanwhile, are keeping a close watch on fuel supplies. About 80 percent of the jet fuel delivered to airports between Florida and Boston comes from Louisiana refineries whose production has been halted or sharply curtailed by Katrina. Earlier this week, the Air Transport Association, a trade group that represents the major airlines, warned that shortages could occur at a number of airports within the next two weeks unless jet fuel supplies are restored. One airport that topped off its tanks in advance was Washington Dulles, a hub for United Airlines and the home base for Independence Air, a low-fare airline. Dulles and nearby Reagan National have a two-week supply of fuel, which was replenished before the hurricane reached Louisiana, said Tara Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the airports. ''We're not having any difficulty as I speak to you now,'' she said yesterday, ''but a week and a half from now, there could be some difficulty.'' But Mark Napier will not be flying from Reno, Nev., to Biloxi, Miss., on the Labor Day weekend trip he had planned to visit his parents and sister. They have evacuated to Panama City Beach, Fla. Yesterday, he received a call from Continental Airlines, telling him there would be no service to Biloxi until at least Oct. 1. ''It's hard to watch your hometown and where you grew up destroyed like that,'' said Mr. Napier, 44, who left Mississippi in 1988. ''I don't even like the place that much, but it surprises me how much it bothers me.'' Labor Day Travel"
"THE TV news folk love hurricanes. You can see it in the bright lights of their eyes, as they muster crews to travel south, as CNN's Anderson Cooper lashes himself to yet another building, the better to show the viewers at home the terrible truth of the wind. If the wind is slow or uncooperative, then they look for flying awnings, or 70-foot-high BP signs sticking out of motel roofs. Great stuff. Lots of water is good, too, up to our ankles, up to our knees. With Hurricane Katrina, there was some ABC guy in New Orleans using himself as a human measuring stick. Tuesday night he was knee-high in water on Canal Street. Wednesday he was chest-high. Soon, if we are lucky, he will disappear altogether. In Hattiesburg, our Hurricane Katrina was a land-based Category 2 storm with sustained 100-mile-per-hour winds. Our trees were knocked silly, shingles and even whole roofs were lifted off buildings, stores were blown out as if bombed, old buildings collapsed, gas stations were mauled. But mostly what I see now, in the aftermath of the storm, is people driving around in their S.U.V.'s, going slowly, as if on parade, witnessing the drama. If New Orleans, post-storm, is a new third-world country, Hattiesburg is more like an old bombing range the Air Force recommissioned in the last 15 minutes. Hattiesburg is today home to 50,000 or more evacuees. I'm making up this number, but it can't be far off. We're right on the main routes north out of New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. People who are hopeful or tired or just don't know much about hurricanes think it's safe to stop here. It isn't, of course. We have our own dead -- not so many as the coast or New Orleans, but just as dead. Without power and water, Hattiesburg becomes a sweat palace, a 100,000-person sauna, and everyone who can be in his or her car is in his or her car, where the air, thank God, is still conditioned. At least as long as the gas holds out, which, from the look of things, isn't going to be all that long. By Thursday afternoon the lines at the pumps are beyond silly, past ludicrous, all the way to ridiculous. Yesterday you waited three hours if you were lucky. Today it's six hours, and a line of 200 cars circling up an off-ramp from Highway 59. And the word is that the government -- federal, state, city, who knows? -- is taking over the gas allocation tomorrow. But if they have the gas, the people are out touring the devastation -- four, five sometimes six to a car. Most beautiful among the sights are the great downed trees, bringing a stately majesty to our streets, something like what the sculptor Mark di Suvero might have done in his heyday, which I don't quite remember now. He is the guy who made art out of giant tree trunks and he would be happy here today. The avenues are littered with exquisitely poised trees -- tilted, angled, jilted, twisted, spun, splintered, bent over, transformed by the storm into great barricades, graceful arches, lovely bridges over roads. It's as if God got tired and tossed a God-sized handful of these 80-foot pine trees, pick-up-sticks fashion, on our town. The good news was that the storm came in the daylight, when you could at least see as your house was about to be crushed by falling timber (mine, fortunately, was relatively unscathed). Early Monday morning, when those ''outer bands'' that the TV announcers like to remark on hit us, the power was still on, so we had the TV to guide us, to hold our hand, to show us the infrared, convection, visible satellite imagery, radar and other views, all of which we took in somberly, all of which seemed to say that we were spectacularly badly placed for the hurricane's passage north. And here an admission. All the hurricanes I've been through, numbering a dozen by now, were a little underwhelming. Your average hurricane at this point inland -- roughly 70 miles from the Gulf of Mexico -- will uproot a few dozen trees, crash through a roof or two, sometimes crush a car or an unsuspecting gas station, and routinely knock down a handful of power lines. Later that day, the power will be back, the water will be back, the stores will open up, and everything will return to normal. This time it's different. The Gulf Coast is a wreck. It looks like that documentary film you always see about the power of the atom bomb, everything just blown away, houses reduced to debris, a rubble-land, buildings razed as if by one of the companies that do that for a living. And the Mississippi Gulf Coast casinos, which are, by ordinance, floating things, three-story barges heaped with gaudy neon, have been tossed like the fat cats they are up onto the shore, crushing everything in their path. One, the Grand Casino in Gulfport, with which I have a dark history, got its just desserts when it was thrown into the middle of Highway 90. There it sits, in the helicopter footage, like a big useless slab of suet, bringing its many benefits to the state. The nastiest remark I heard was from someone who, on hearing the bad luck of the casinos being destroyed, said that they were all no doubt insured to the gills, and that they would probably make money on this, too. Too, he said. He was a man after my own heart. Meanwhile, back in Hattiesburg, the heat is grotesque and there are people doing wonderful things for each other. People getting food out to the needy, people giving free ice to people who need ice, the manager at the Wendy's sending out free burgers to the police officers directing traffic. The post-hurricane quotidian is so far the opposite of New Orleans: the ridiculous conditions are bringing out the best, not the worst, in the natives. I say ''so far'' advisedly and with considerable hope. Today the word is we're looking at two to four weeks without power and who knows what will happen. I'm gearing up for a long camping trip. That's what it's like here now -- camping, enforced camping, required camping, the kind of camping from which you couldn't go home early if you wanted to.

"When Michael D. Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, returned in January from a tour of the tsunami devastation in Asia, he urgently gathered his aides to prepare for a similar catastrophe at home. ''New Orleans was the No.1 disaster we were talking about,'' recalled Eric L. Tolbert, then a top FEMA official. ''We were obsessed with New Orleans because of the risk.'' Disaster officials, who had drawn up dozens of plans and conducted preparedness drills for years, had long known that the low-lying city was especially vulnerable. But despite all the warnings, Hurricane Katrina overwhelmed the very government agencies that had rehearsed for such a calamity. On Thursday, as the flooded city descended into near-anarchy, frantic local officials blasted the federal and state emergency response as woefully sluggish and confused. ''We're in our fifth day and adequate help to quell the situation has not arrived yet,'' said Edwin P. Compass III, the New Orleans police superintendent. The response will be dissected for years. But on Thursday, disaster experts and frustrated officials said a crucial shortcoming may have been the failure to predict that the levees keeping Lake Pontchartrain out of the city would be breached, not just overflow. They also said that evacuation measures were inadequate, leaving far too many city residents behind to suffer severe hardships and, in some cases, join marauding gangs. Large numbers of National Guard troops should have been deployed on flooded streets early in the disaster to keep order, the critics said. And some questioned whether the federal government's intense focus on terrorism had distracted from planning practical steps to cope with a major natural disaster. Disaster experts acknowledged that the impact of Hurricane Katrina posed unprecedented difficulties. ''There are amazing challenges and obstacles,'' said Joe Becker, the top disaster response official at the American Red Cross. Under the circumstances, Mr. Becker said, the government response ''has been nothing short of heroic.'' But he added that the first, life-saving phase of hurricane response, which usually lasts a matter of hours, in this case was stretching over days. While some in New Orleans fault FEMA -- Terry Ebbert, homeland security director for New Orleans, called it a ''hamstrung'' bureaucracy -- others say any blame should be more widely spread. Local, state and federal officials, for example, have cooperated on disaster planning. In 2000, they studied the impact of a fictional ''Hurricane Zebra''; last year they drilled with ''Hurricane Pam.'' Neither exercise expected the levees to fail. In an interview Thursday on ''Good Morning America,'' President Bush said, ''I don't think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees.'' He added, ''Now we're having to deal with it, and will.'' Some lapses may have occurred because of budget cuts. For example, Mr. Tolbert, the former FEMA official, said that ''funding dried up'' for follow-up to the 2004 Hurricane Pam exercise, cutting off work on plans to shelter thousands of survivors. Brian Wolshon, an engineering professor at Louisiana State University who served as a consultant on the state's evacuation plan, said little attention was paid to moving out New Orleans's ''low-mobility'' population -- the elderly, the infirm and the poor without cars or other means of fleeing the city, about 100,000 people. At disaster planning meetings, he said, ''the answer was often silence.'' Inevitably, the involvement of dozens of agencies complicated the response. FEMA and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, were in charge of coordinating 14 federal agencies with state and local authorities. But Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans complained Wednesday on CNN that there were too many cooks involved. Unlike a terrorist attack or an earthquake, Hurricane Katrina gave considerable notice of its arrival. It was on Thursday, Aug. 25, that a tropical storm that had formed in the Bahamas reached hurricane strength and got its name. The same day, Katrina made landfall in Florida, dumping up to 18 inches of rain. It then moved slowly out over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, growing by the hour. Though its path remained uncertain, the Gulf Coast was clearly threatened, with New Orleans a possible target. Officials from the Pentagon, the National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA and the Homeland Security Department said they were taking steps to prepare for the hurricane's arrival. Army Corps personnel, in charge of maintaining the levees in New Orleans, started to secure the locks, floodgates and other equipment, said Greg Breerwood, deputy district engineer for project management at the Army Corps of Engineers. ''We knew if it was going to be a Category 5, some levees and some flood walls would be overtopped,'' he said. ''We never did think they would actually be breached.'' The uncertainty of the storm's course affected Pentagon planning. ''We did not have precision on where it would make landfall,'' said Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum, the head of the National Guard Bureau. ''It could have been anywhere from Texas all the way over to Florida.'' Some 10,000 National Guard troops were mobilized, 7,000 of them in Louisiana and Mississippi. But the Defense Department could not put soldiers and equipment directly in the possible path of the storm, General Blum said. On Saturday, at the urging of FEMA, Mr. Bush declared an emergency in Louisiana, allowing the agency to promise financial assistance to state and local governments and to move ready-to-eat meals, medicine, ice, tarpaulins, water and other supplies to the region. By Sunday, Katrina had become a Category 5 hurricane, with winds of 175 miles per hour. The president extended the emergency declaration to Mississippi and Alabama. Mayor Nagin, who had urged New Orleans residents to flee on Saturday, ordered a mandatory evacuation. It would have been up to local officials, a FEMA spokeswoman said, to hire buses to move people without transportation out of the city. Rodney Braxton, the chief lobbyist for New Orleans, said many of the city's poorest ''had nowhere to go outside the region and no way to get there.'' He added: ''And there wasn't enough police power to go to each house to say, 'You have to go, come with me.''' In a city with so many residents living in poverty, the hurricane came at the worst possible time: the end of the month, when those depending on public assistance are waiting for their next checks to be mailed on the first of the month. Without the checks, many residents didn't have money for gasoline, bus fare or lodging. City officials said they provided free transportation from pick-up points publicized on television, radio and by people shouting through megaphones on the streets. In addition to the Superdome, officials opened schools and the convention center as shelters. Mr. Braxton said he believed the city was ''aggressive enough'' in conducting the evacuation. ''We had everything we thought we needed in place,'' he said. ''I don't think anybody could ever plan for the magnitude that Katrina ended up being.'' But Susan Cutter, a geography professor at the University of South Carolina and an emergency preparedness expert, said Mayor Nagin should have ordered a mandatory evacuation on Thursday or Friday. ''Evacuation is a precaution,'' she said. ''I don't think they would have taken a political hit if they had ordered it, and it helped.'' While New Orleans residents fled the city or gathered in the Superdome, federal agencies positioned search and rescue teams and medical assistance teams from Tennessee to Texas, according to Michael Chertoff, secretary of homeland security. Before it made landfall on Monday, the storm turned slightly to the east, avoiding a direct hit on New Orleans. The winds had eased slightly to 140 miles per hour, reducing Katrina's strength to Category 4, and officials counted themselves lucky. But on Tuesday, when the levees breached, a desperate situation became catastrophic. There was no fast way to fix them, Mr. Breerwood of the Army Corps said, because delivery of heavy-duty equipment was hindered by the destruction. The National Guard was having similar troubles. While troops were stationed in the region, they could not move quickly into the New Orleans area. And in Mississippi, the zone of destruction was so widespread, it was difficult to cover it all quickly, officials said. ''It is not a function of more people, but how many people can you move on the road system that exists now in Louisiana and in Mississippi,'' said General Blum of the National Guard. ''How many people can you put through that funnel that a storm has taken four lane highways and turned them into goat trails?'' On Wednesday, Mr. Bush, having cut short his vacation, convened a federal task force. With looting spreading throughout New Orleans, Guard officials said they were doubling the call by this weekend, to 21,000 forces, one-third of them military police officers. On Thursday, General Blum said more than 32,000 Guard members would be deployed in the gulf region by Monday. Currently, the states' governors control their National Guard, with the Pentagon and other federal agencies like FEMA, coordinating operations with the state. The administration has resisted federalizing the relief operation, in large part because officials say it would severely limit the National Guard's ability to conduct law enforcement missions for which they are specifically trained. ''Federalizing the National Guard for purposes of law enforcement would be a last resort, not a first resort,'' said Paul McHale, assistant secretary of defense for homeland security, told reporters on Thursday. A 1878 law restricts active-duty military forces from performing domestic law enforcement duties. But in extreme emergencies, like some of the race riots and civil disorders in the 1960's, federal troops have been sent in to restore order. The administration has also balked at ordering active-duty military forces, such as the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., to intervene in a civilian law enforcement role to stop looting and restore order. Late Tuesday, the Pentagon dispatched five ships to the gulf, but four of the ships are coming from Norfolk, Va., four days' sailing time away. Some military analysts criticized the Pentagon's response. ''Is the problem that they are only just now beginning to understand how serious the damage was?'' said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a national security policy group in Washington. ''Did they not have a contingency for a disaster of this magnitude?'' The chaotic response came despite repeated efforts over many years to plan a coordinated defense if the worst should occur. As recently as July 2004, federal, state and local officials cooperated on the Hurricane Pam drill, which predicted 10 to 15 feet of water in parts of the city and the evacuation of one million people. Martha Madden, who was the Louisiana secretary of environmental quality from 1987-1988, said that the potential for disaster was always obvious and that ''FEMA has known this for 20 years.'' ''Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent, in studies, training and contingency plans, scenarios, all of that,'' said Ms. Madden, now a consultant in strategic planning. The Army Corps, she said, should have had arrangements in place with contractors who had emergency supplies at hand, like sandbags or concrete barriers, the way that environmental planners have contracts to handle oil spills. While his agency is facing harsh criticism, Patrick Rhode, FEMA's deputy director, defended its performance as ''probably one of the most efficient and effective responses in the country's history.'' He recalled that after Mr. Brown, his boss, returned from his tsunami tour, he asked if the United States was better prepared for a disaster than the ravaged countries he had visited. ''We felt relatively comfortable that this country could mobilize the response necessary,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: FEDERAL RESPONSE"
"These are the scenes of a dying city: an elderly woman dead in a wheelchair outside the convention center, a note on her lap bearing her name. A horrified family telling tales of pirates commandeering rescue boats at gunpoint. Corpses left rotting in broad daylight. Angry crowds chanting for the television cameras, ''We're dying!'' or simply ''Help!'' On the streets of this submerged town, the anxiety and deprivation that had built up over four days gave way on Thursday to misery, despair and anger as the refugees of Hurricane Katrina waited yet another day for their deliverance. While the authorities issued progress reports on the evacuation effort and reassured the rest of the nation that help was on the way, the stranded thousands here heard none of it. Left with little or no food, water, medical care or even police protection, they looked out in fear or lashed out in rage at a world that seemed to have forgotten them. ''They're not organized,'' said Curtis Green, 38, a cook who stood waiting in a throng of thousands outside the Superdome, waiting for buses to take them away. ''Nobody has any plans. We're depending upon them for food, water and shelter. Who's in charge?'' Outside the convention center, in a once-prosperous section of town, at least a half-dozen corpses lay slumped in lawn chairs or covered with makeshift shrouds. An estimated 25,000 people congregated there, many lamenting that the authorities had directed them there, then left them in the sweltering heat without food, water, medical care or security. A weeping young woman held out her dehydrated-looking child and pleaded for help. ''This is not about rich people or poor people,'' she said. ''This is about people.'' All over the city hung a sense of helplessness, of an anarchy that not even top officials could pin down with hard facts or figures. ''We have individuals who are getting raped,'' the city's police superintendent, Edwin P. Compass III, said in a brief interview about the scene at the convention center. ''We have individuals who are getting beaten.'' Asked about the numerous accounts of rapes, Joseph H. Matthews, a deputy fire chief and the director of the city's Office of Emergency Preparedness, said some were ''probably'' true. ''Nothing's been confirmed, but you can't discount these reports,'' Mr. Matthews said. The evacuation was proceeding slowly at the Superdome, where the largest group of refugees -- about 30,000 -- were being loaded onto buses, most of them for the 350-mile trip to the Astrodome in Houston. As they boarded, other refugees from around the city who had heard of the buses' arrival streamed into the arena. Kayresa Newman's baby was passing out in her arms as the dense, surging crowd at the Superdome flattened them against a chest-high steel fence. They were stuck in the sweating, frantic mass of people trying to edge toward the gate leading to buses evacuating the ovenlike arena with its overflowing toilets. ''I need to get this kid out of here,'' she said to the armed soldiers trying to control the crowd. Squeezed in behind her, barely able to move, Isabel Capo was sobbing. Wedged near her at the front of the wall of hungry, unbathed refugees, James Edwards was trying to tell the soldiers about his bad heart. Like passengers on a doomed ship, they were desperate to get out of the noxious, violence-ridden stadium. The sick were supposed to be getting priority. But the soldiers, overwhelmed by the enormity of the task of getting the people on the buses, were having trouble distinguishing degrees of need. So they were mostly letting people go to the buses first come, first served. Buses trickled in slowly through the day under armed guard. Thousands stood out in the open waiting for their chance, alternatively baking under a blazing sun and being soaked by a drizzling rain. Many had been feeling neglected and abused in the understaffed and undersupplied arena and the waiting only made them angrier. Over and over, people collapsed in the ankle-deep water as they got near the buses, some suffering from the lack of their usual medication and others stumbling from weakness. Early Thursday the atmosphere in the dome seemed to be veering toward anarchy. Shortly after midnight, the military said, a man attacked a patrolling National Guard soldier with a metal club in a darkened locker room. The man tried to take the soldier's M-16 rifle. They struggled and three gunshots echoed through the stadium, one bullet lodging in the soldier's leg. The man fled, but a heavily armed Special Response Team in black baseball caps tracked him down, and he was arrested. Military officers said the special team took steps to secure the area. But storm victims said the loud clack of the soldiers pumping live ammunition into their automatic rifles and then pointing the rifles at the crowd terrified them. Later in the morning, at 6:20, a fire broke out on a sofa in a corridor and spread to a heap of dirty clothing. Though the fire was small and fairly contained, it filled the dome with smoke and the soldiers ordered everyone outside. At least three people have died in the Superdome since the hurricane, military officials said. Two elderly people collapsed and died in the heat, and one man jumped or fell to his death. Major Ed Bush, a spokesman for the Louisiana National Guard, said he was relieved that the exodus had begun. ''Conditions in the dome are bad,'' he said. ''People were approaching the point where if something didn't happen they had just about had enough.'' Kevin Banks, 29, and his mother and daughter were glad they left the Superdome on Tuesday night and found an outlying spot where refugees had gathered. They got on a bus for Houston the next day, he said in an interview at the Astrodome. He said pirates had been seizing boats carrying refugees. ''They were taking AK's at the people on the boat,'' he said, ''telling them to get off the boat and flipping you and your children out.'' For others, the evacuation that had been billed as a direct trip from New Orleans to Houston turned out more like a Rube Goldberg invention as refugees, scooped from roofs or straggling in from sunken streets, were dropped at one staging point, only to be herded up and moved to another, then another. About a half-mile from downtown, under an Interstate 10 overpass in Jefferson Parish, thousands of evacuees were spread across an open field without food, water, sanitation or any sense of where they were headed next. Harry Lee, the Jefferson County sheriff whose jurisdiction is as closely connected to New Orleans as Queens is to Brooklyn, said that their arrival began Tuesday without any notification from the federal or state agencies involved. ''They left them at I-10 and the causeway and they didn't tell me anything,'' he said. The refugees' anger was understandable, he said. Since the hurricane arrived, he said, ''We're seeing the emotion of fear. Fear has turned into frustration and anxiety. Over the next three days anxiety turned to anger. They're looking for someone to help them, and I can't do it.'' Gary Antoine Sr., 54, and six neighbors spent the last four days on his apartment building roof in central New Orleans without food or water, trying to flag down helicopters. The water on the street was eight feet deep, he guessed, and they were going nowhere until a helicopter finally picked them up Thursday afternoon. Then they spent four hours waiting for the long lines to buses to thin out, munching on Salvation Army hotdogs in a blue plastic tent. They heard they might be going to Houston, but were not sure, and no one was providing them any information. ''It's a free-for-all,'' Mr. Antoine said. ''It don't really matter where we go, as long as we get processed as refugees and get out of this chaos.'' Donald Greenwald, 45, fled St. Bernard Parish east of New Orleans, one of the worst hit areas, Monday night, but he did not arrive at this embarkation point until Thursday afternoon. In between, he spent two nights at a school and another at a ferry terminal, trying to get himself and his 84-year-old mother to dry ground. Late in the afternoon they hitched a ride on an Army National Guard truck to the I-10 encampment. But as he surveyed the throngs he worried that he could not get his ailing mother through the crowd pushing its way toward the buses. ''This is a very unorganized situation,'' said Mr. Greenwald, who was wearing water-soaked sneakers and cutoff jeans. ''They've got to start worrying about people here, and not on the other side of the world.'' As a continuous line of Army Blackhawk helicopters and Coast Guard helicopters ferried in new loads of people, emergency medical teams cared for the ill, the dehydrated and the exhausted in triage tents along the highway. On Wednesday medics delivered a baby there. Susan Lamare, 42, her three children and her three nieces and nephews were plucked off their roof in southern New Orleans this morning. They had tried twice to board buses on Thursday but each time were shoved out of the way by the crowd. ''I thought I was escaping,'' Ms. Lamare said. ''I didn't know what I was getting into.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE EVACUATION"
"Refugees from New Orleans arrived Thursday at the Houston Astrodome, finding a roof, dry cots, air-conditioning and hot food. But after accepting 11, 500 refugees, a Red Cross spokeswoman said, the Astrodome was deemed full and people were being diverted to other shelters in the area Thursday night. Those who were able to be accommodated found some conditions familiar to those who fled the Superdome: raw tensions, long lines and some backed-up toilets, portending trouble ahead as thousands more were expected to come. And as much as the Astrodome was an improvement over the chaos and desperation of New Orleans, few wanted to be there or could bear the thought of weeks cooped up in an abandoned stadium. ''I'm ready to go home,'' said a distraught Deborah Taylor, 29, who was rescued from the roof of her New Orleans home by helicopter on Thursday morning, placed on a bus with her boyfriend and her 10-year-old son and 10 hours later was at the Astrodome. ''I don't care about the water. I cannot deal with this.'' Pleading for patience, officials in Houston conceded that they had not fully prepared for a disaster of this scale and potential duration and that they were improvising in a situation growing more difficult by the hour. ''Nobody came up with a plan for having this many refugees in our country,'' said Bill White, the mayor of Houston. ''We are being asked to meet needs that nobody envisioned even a few days ago.'' Officials expected to put up about 25,000 people at the Astrodome, but accepted only 11,500 inside , said Margaret O'Brien-Molina, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross. The strain was being felt across Houston, with two million people the fourth-largest city in the United States. Red Cross shelters were filling up faster than new ones could be opened, the city's hotel rooms were virtually sold out and officials were scrambling to find basic food and medical needs as well as classrooms for thousands of children. Medical triage stations were being set up at the Astrodome and at Ellington Field south of Houston, where the seriously ill and injured were landing on military transports. An estimated 75,000 storm refugees were already in Houston on Thursday with as many as 40,000 more on the way. State officials said Dallas and San Antonio had been told to prepare for at least 25,000 each. Six hundred people spent Wednesday night at Reunion Arena in Dallas, and officials there expected hundreds more. In Houston, officials said that one of their biggest problems was a lack of information from Louisiana, where civil authority throughout much of the storm-ravaged region had all but broken down. They did not know how many people were coming to Texas. ''It appears that the officials there have been overwhelmed by the magnitude of this disaster,'' said Robert Eckels, the chief executive of Harris County, which includes Houston. Outside the Astrodome, dazed travelers from the flood zone showed up looking for a place to stay. The official plan was to admit only people from the Superdome, but others were being allowed in Thursday. A group of 14 walked in after having driven all night in a catering truck they stole off the streets of New Orleans. ''The police stopped us and said, 'I know it's not yours,' but he let us go,'' said Glorida Collins, 26, who was holding her 6-month-old son, Nakee. ''There were people down there shooting to protect their own boats. It's a survival thing.'' Shortly after arriving at the Astrodome on Thursday with his mother and daughter, Kevin Banks, 29, and two friends headed outside for a look at their new surroundings, discovering a parking lot packed with the vehicles of the news media, volunteers and law enforcement. ''I don't even remember the days,'' Mr. Banks said. ''What is today?'' The crowd in the Superdome had been overwhelming, Mr. Banks said, making the atmosphere even that much more uncomfortable. ''It was hot and sweaty,'' Mr. Banks said. ''Literally, there was manure on the ground. I don't know if it was from horses, humans or whatever.'' The Astrodome, the nation's first fully enclosed stadium, which proud Texans once called the Eighth Wonder of the World, has long figured in the region's emergency plans, but it had never before been called on to cope with a disaster of this scope. Mr. Eckels said Houston hoped to avoid repeating the horrific conditions at the Superdome, but acknowledged that the Astrodome, or any other sports stadium, was not a suitable place for long-term living for thousands of people. ''We will not have the squalor they had in the Superdome,'' he said. Still, he added, ''This is a shelter from the storm, not a home.'' Inside the dome, the former home of the Houston Astros, hundreds of volunteers organized by the Red Cross had set up cots on the playing field and started serving meals to the stream of new residents. Everyone entering the dome was checked for drugs and weapons. Houston police officers and Harris County sheriff's deputies patrolled inside and out. A decontamination tent was set up near one entrance, but it was not put to immediate use. The recent arrivals seemed relieved to be off the road, away from the flood, in a cool place with water and hot food, at least for the first few thousand refugees. A group of boys tossed a football, and small children played with donated crayons and coloring books. ''Hey, I've got a roof, I've got food,'' said Calvin Parker, 48, who arrived by bus in the late afternoon. ''They gave me some clothes, and I got to take a shower. I'm really grateful, even though it's like 300 or 400 miles away from home, it's still a place to go.'' But many of the refugees, dirty and hungry, wandered about aimlessly. The walls of one corridor became an impromptu place for dozens of Post-it notes scribbled with the names of relatives, like after the World Trade Center attack, asking them to call if they were into the dome. Some carried cardboard placards above their heads. Others simply tried to make sense of what fate had dealt them. ''I have no idea where to go from here,'' said Joe Joseph, 38, who said that before the storm he had a good-paying job in a factory and an almost new Dodge pickup. ''Yesterday I felt flush. Today I got nothing.'' A number took advantage of the hot showers in the Astrodome's locker rooms, and stood in lines to avail themselves of charity as it flowed through the door: hundreds of Papa John's pizzas, used clothing donated by Houstonians, crates of diapers, crates of Bibles. Some stockpiled pizza and water under their cots. Lines formed to use a limited number of telephones for people trying to find relatives. Refugees clamored for clean T-shirts as they were handed out, mobbing volunteers from the American Red Cross. (An enterprising member of the Houston school board, Kevin Hoffman, who is running for re-election, donated some yellow campaign T-shirts.) Elsewhere in Houston, refugees turned away at the Astrodome packed into hotels and church shelters. At one shelter run by St. Peter Claver Church in the Settegast neighborhood, more than 300 people squeezed into one room. In Dallas, Fred Daniels, who lost his home in New Orleans, was washing up at Reunion Arena. ''I might go back at some point and see if there's anything I can get out of my house,'' he said. ''But we've lost everything. And it's a city that's doomed. I don't think we could go back.'' STORM AND CRISIS: EXODUS"
"Despair, privation and violent lawlessness grew so extreme in New Orleans on Thursday that the flooded city's mayor issued a ''desperate SOS'' and other local officials, describing the security situation as horrific, lambasted the federal government as responding too slowly to the disaster. Thousands of refugees from Hurricane Katrina boarded buses for Houston, but others quickly took their places at the filthy, teeming Superdome, which has been serving as the primary shelter. At the increasingly unsanitary convention center, crowds swelled to about 25,000 and desperate refugees clamored for food, water and attention while dead bodies, slumped in wheelchairs or wrapped in sheets, lay in their midst. ''Some people there have not eaten or drunk water for three or four days, which is inexcusable,'' acknowledged Joseph W. Matthews, the director of the city's Office of Emergency Preparedness. ''We need additional troops, food, water,'' Mr. Matthews begged, ''and we need personnel, law enforcement. This has turned into a situation where the city is being run by thugs.'' Three days after the hurricane hit, bringing widespread destruction to the Gulf Coast and ruinous floods to low-lying New Orleans, the White House said President Bush would tour the region on Friday. Citing the magnitude of the disaster, federal officials defended their response so far and pledged that more help was coming. The Army Corps of Engineers continued work to close a levee breach that allowed water from Lake Pontchartrain to pour into New Orleans. The effects of the disaster spilled out over the country. In Houston, the city began to grapple with the logistics of taking tens of thousands of refugees into the Astrodome. American Red Cross officials said late Thursday night that the Astrodome was full after accepting more than 11,000 refugees and that evacuees were being sent to other shelters in the Houston area. Elsewhere, San Antonio and Dallas each braced for the arrival of 25,000 more, and Baton Rouge overnight replaced New Orleans as the most populous city in Louisiana and was bursting at the seams. The devastation in the Gulf Coast also continued to roil oil markets, sending gasoline prices soaring in many areas of the country. In North Carolina, Gov. Michael F. Easley called on citizens to conserve fuel while two big pipelines that supply most of the state's gasoline were brought back on line. Throughout the stricken region, scores of frantic people, without telephone service, asked for help contacting friends or relatives whose fates they did not know. Some ended up finding them dead. Others had emotional reunions. Newspapers offered toll-free numbers or Web message boards for the searches. Meanwhile, the situation in New Orleans continued to deteriorate. Angry crowds chanted cries for help, and some among them rushed chaotically at helicopters bringing in food. Although Mayor C. Ray Nagin speculated that thousands might have died, officials said they still did not have a clear idea of the precise toll. ''We're just a bunch of rats,'' said Earle Young, 31, a cook who stood waiting in a throng of perhaps 10,000 outside the Superdome, waiting in the blazing sun for buses to take them away from the city. ''That's how they've been treating us.'' Chaos and gunfire hampered efforts to evacuate the Superdome, and, Superintendent P. Edward Compass III of the New Orleans Police Department said, armed thugs have taken control of the secondary makeshift shelter at the convention center. Superintendent Compass said that the thugs repelled eight squads of 11 officers each he had sent to secure the place and that rapes and assaults were occurring unimpeded in the neighboring streets as criminals ''preyed upon'' passers-by, including stranded tourists. Mr. Compass said the federal government had taken too long to send in the thousands of troops -- as well as the supplies, fuel, vehicles, water and food -- needed to stabilize his now ''very, very tenuous'' city. Col. Terry Ebbert, director of homeland security for New Orleans, concurred and he was particularly pungent in his criticism. Asserting that the whole recovery operation had been ''carried on the backs of the little guys for four goddamn days,'' he said ''the rest of the goddamn nation can't get us any resources for security.'' ''We are like little birds with our mouths open and you don't have to be very smart to know where to drop the worm,'' Colonel Ebbert said. ''It's criminal within the confines of the United States that within one hour of the hurricane they weren't force-feeding us. It's like FEMA has never been to a hurricane.'' FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Federal officials took pains to defend their efforts, maintaining that supplies were pouring into the area even before the hurricane struck, that thousands of National Guard members had arrived to help secure the city and that thousands more would join them in coming days. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said some 300 National Guard members from Arkansas were flying into New Orleans with the express task of reclaiming the city. ''They have M-16's and they are locked and loaded,'' she said. Speaking at a news conference in Washington, Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, said that the Superdome had ''crowd control issues'' but that it was secure. He referred to what he called ''isolated incidents of criminality'' in the city. Mr. Chertoff said Hurricane Katrina had presented a ''double challenge'' because it was really two disasters in one: the storm and then the flooding. ''For those who wonder why it is that it is difficult to get these supplies and these medical teams into place, the answer is they are battling an ongoing dynamic problem with the water,'' he said. On Thursday, the Army Corps of Engineers was battling the water problem by finishing a metal wall across the mouth of the 17th Street Canal, the source of most of the flooding. Once finished, the wall was expected to staunch the flow from Lake Pontchartrain into the canal, which would allow engineers to repair a breach in the levee and to start pumping water from the city. The federal government's other priority was to evacuate New Orleans, Mr. Chertoff said. To that end, some 200 buses had left the Superdome for the Astrodome in Houston by midday, he said, adding that another 200 buses were expected to start loading passengers later Thursday and that Louisiana was providing an additional 500 school buses. On the receiving end in Houston, though, the Astrodome looked at times like a squatters' camp in a war-torn country. The refugees from Louisiana, many dirty and hungry, wandered about aimlessly, checking bulletin boards for information about their relatives, queuing up for supplies and pay phones, mobbing Red Cross volunteers to obtain free T-shirts. Many found some conditions similar to those that they left behind at the Superdome, like clogged toilets and foul restrooms. But in Houston, there were hot showers, crates of Bibles and stacks of pizzas, while in New Orleans, many refugees scrounged for diapers, water and basic survival. The Senate convened a special session at 10 p.m. Thursday to pass the an emergency supplemental spending bill providing $10.5 billion for relief efforts. Senator Thad Cochran, the Mississippi Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he had just returned from his home state. ''The whole coastal area of the state has been destroyed, virtually destroyed,'' he said. ''It was quiet. It was eerie. It was horrible to behold.'' House leaders intended to hold a special session Friday to approve the measure. Even as administration officials pledged vast resources to the region, however, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, told a local newspaper, The Daily Herald, that he was skeptical about using billions in federal money to rebuild New Orleans, given its vulnerability. ''It doesn't make sense to me,'' Mr. Hastert said. ''And it's a question that certainly we should ask.'' He later sought to clarify his comments, saying in a statement: ''I am not advocating that the city be abandoned or relocated. My comments about rebuilding the city were intended to reflect my sincere concern with how the city is rebuilt to ensure the future protection of its citizens.'' Shea Penland, director of the Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of New Orleans, had stayed in his Garden District home through the storm and its immediate aftermath. But on Thursday his generator was running out of fuel, and he was tiring. ''People have only so much staying power with no infrastructure,'' Dr. Penland said. ''I am boarding up my house today and will hopefully be in Baton Rouge or the north shore tonight.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"A woman in a wheelchair, her face and body covered by a plaid blanket, dead, and left next to a wall of the New Orleans convention center like a discarded supermarket cart. There were many other appalling images from Hurricane Katrina on Thursday, but that one was a turning point: after three days of flood scenes, television shifted from recording a devastating natural disaster to exposing human failures. All morning, cable news networks showed scene after scene of victims, most of them black, stranded without adequate food, water or shelter, helpless and enraged. Outrage was also in the voices of television reporters on the ground, working without satellite trucks or car batteries and trying to describe the scenes of misery and chaos. Even the network anchors dispensed with neutrality to register their dismay. Brian Williams anchored a special one-hour edition of ''The NBC Nightly News'' in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, La., telling viewers that his news division had determined it was not safe to be in New Orleans. Those on the scene concurred. ''There is nobody in charge,'' said Chris Lawrence of CNN, describing the despair and lawlessness in and outside the convention center. ''It's a complete free-for-all.'' It was as those images of mounting desperation and disorder began dominating the screen that Washington suddenly seemed to snap to attention. The mounting indignation on the ground spilled over into a televised appearance by Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security. As Mr. Chertoff tried to reassure viewers that the federal authorities had matters under control, CNN and Fox News split the screen and had him speak alongside images of stranded refugees, looters, and a bare-chested man, knee-deep in water, battering a store window with a baseball bat. Normally, hurricane stories are mesmerizing because they give us a sense of control. The queasy thrill of looming disaster is usually mediated by famous anchormen ritually rigged out in waders and slickers, reporting over gale winds. Even the montage of familiarly strange images -- the whirls of a satellite map, shattered houses, felled trees, the sirens of hastening fire trucks, neighbor helping neighbor and officials numbingly reciting the emergency procedures -- tamps down fear. We've seen it before, and we know how it ends. But after three days, Hurricane Katrina still looked nothing like what Americans are used to seeing. The morning began with reports of people shooting at rescue helicopters. In New Orleans, cameras recorded dead bodies in the street, old people and children left unattended and pitiful groups of refugees wading through contaminated water, clutching plastic garbage bags. Hoda Kotb, an NBC reporter, sounded bewildered as she described a sea of stranded victims, including a woman with a 10-day-old baby. ''It's a scene out of another country,'' she said. At times, the scenes on television were so woeful they looked as if they could have been filmed in a former Soviet republic or Haiti. And that was how television correspondents put it. ''This is not Iraq, this is not Somalia,'' said Martin Savidge of NBC. ''This is home.'' Even some of the coverage was unusually primitive. In a nation that put live cameras on the space shuttle and into combat in Iraq, film crews were unusually hamstrung. The news channels had to work around power failures, disrupted cellphone service and lack of fuel to maintain contact with correspondents and producers. A lot of the images were fragmented and confusing, underscoring the raw magnitude of the disaster. ''We were expecting a naval armada,'' said Shepard Smith, a Fox News anchor reporting from Louisiana. ''It hasn't happened.'' The image of helplessness was one the White House worked hard to defuse, vowing to restore law and order and politely declining offers of aid from overseas as unnecessary. The networks broke into their regular programming to broadcast President Bush's reassurances to the nation; he was flanked by his father and former President Bill Clinton. Later, the two former presidents spoke in a CNN interview with Suzanne Malveaux. Mr. Clinton could not suppress a smile as he reported that the ambassador from Sri Lanka had offered to coordinate the tsunami countries to raise money for the Katrina victims. By late afternoon, there were images of helicopters landing and convoys of military trucks and volunteers unfolding green cots in the Houston Astrodome. But emotions and frustration were still running high. On CNN, the normally unflappable Wolf Blitzer was not mollified: ''So much is not being done for these people.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE TV WATCH -- THE NEWS MEDIA"
"The scenes of floating corpses, scavengers fighting for food and desperate throngs seeking any way out of New Orleans have been tragic enough. But for many African-American leaders, there is a growing outrage that many of those still stuck at the center of this tragedy were people who for generations had been pushed to the margins of society. The victims, they note, were largely black and poor, those who toiled in the background of the tourist havens, living in tumbledown neighborhoods that were long known to be vulnerable to disaster if the levees failed. Without so much as a car or bus fare to escape ahead of time, they found themselves left behind by a failure to plan for their rescue should the dreaded day ever arrive. ''If you know that terror is approaching in terms of hurricanes, and you've already seen the damage they've done in Florida and elsewhere, what in God's name were you thinking?'' said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. ''I think a lot of it has to do with race and class. The people affected were largely poor people. Poor, black people.'' In the days since neighborhoods and towns along the Gulf Coast were wiped out by the winds and water, there has been a growing sense that race and class are the unspoken markers of who got out and who got stuck. Just as in developing countries where the failures of rural development policies become glaringly clear at times of natural disasters like floods or drought, many national leaders said, some of the United States' poorest cities have been left vulnerable by federal policies. ''No one would have checked on a lot of the black people in these parishes while the sun shined,'' said Mayor Milton D. Tutwiler of Winstonville, Miss. ''So am I surprised that no one has come to help us now? No.'' The subject is roiling black-oriented Web sites and message boards, and many black officials say it is a prime subject of conversation around the country. Some African-Americans have described the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina as ''our tsunami,'' while noting that there has yet to be a response equal to that which followed the Asian tragedy. Roosevelt F. Dorn, the mayor of Inglewood, Calif., and the president of the National Association of Black Mayors, said relief and rescue officials needed to act faster. ''I have a list of black mayors in Mississippi and Alabama who are crying out for help,'' Mr. Dorn said. ''Their cities are gone and they are in despair. And no one has answered their cries.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson said cities had been dismissed by the Bush administration because Mr. Bush received few urban votes. ''Many black people feel that their race, their property conditions and their voting patterns have been a factor in the response,'' Mr. Jackson said, after meeting with Louisiana officials yesterday. ''I'm not saying that myself, but what's self-evident is that you have many poor people without a way out.'' In New Orleans, the disaster's impact underscores the intersection of race and class in a city where fully two-thirds of its residents are black and more than a quarter of the city lives in poverty. In the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood, which was inundated by the floodwaters, more than 98 percent of the residents are black and more than a third live in poverty. Spencer R. Crew, president and chief executive officer of the national Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, said the aftermath of the hurricane would force people to confront inequality. ''Most cities have a hidden or not always talked about poor population, black and white, and most of the time we look past them,'' Dr. Crew said. ''This is a moment in time when we can't look past them. Their plight is coming to the forefront now. They were the ones less able to hop in a car and less able to drive off.'' That disparity has been criticized as a ''disgrace'' by Charles B. Rangel, the senior Democratic congressman from New York City, who said it was made all the worse by the failure of government officials to have planned. ''I assume the president's going to say he got bad intelligence, Mr. Rangel said, adding that the danger to the levees was clear. ''I think that wherever you see poverty, whether it's in the white rural community or the black urban community, you see that the resources have been sucked up into the war and tax cuts for the rich,'' he said. Outside Brooklyn Law School yesterday, a man selling recordings of famous African-Americans was upset at the failure to have prepared for the worst. The man, who said his name was Muhammad Ali, drew a damning conclusion about the failure to protect New Orleans. ''Blacks ain't worth it,'' he said. ''New Orleans is a hopeless case.'' Among the messages and essays circulating in cyberspace that lament the lost lives and missed opportunities is one by Mark Naison, a white professor of African-American Studies at Fordham University in the Bronx. ''Is this what the pioneers of the civil rights movement fought to achieve, a society where many black people are as trapped and isolated by their poverty as they were by segregation laws?'' Mr. Naison wrote. ''If Sept. 11 showed the power of a nation united in response to a devastating attack, Hurricane Katrina reveals the fault lines of a region and a nation, rent by profound social divisions.'' That sentiment was shared by members of other minority groups who understand the bizarre equality of poverty. ''We tend to think of natural disasters as somehow even-handed, as somehow random,'' said Martín Espada, an English professor at the University of Massachusetts and poet of a decidedly leftist political bent who is Puerto Rican. ''Yet it has always been thus: poor people are in danger. That is what it means to be poor. It's dangerous to be poor. It's dangerous to be black. It's dangerous to be Latino.'' This Sunday there will be prayers. In pews from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast, the faithful will come together and pray for those who lived and those who died. They will seek to understand something that has yet to be fully comprehended. Some may talk of a divine hand behind all of this. But others have already noted the absence of a human one. ''Everything is God's will,'' said Charles Steele Jr., the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta. ''But there's a certain amount of common sense that God gives to individuals to prepare for certain things.'' That means, Mr. Steele said, not waiting until the eve of crisis. ''Most of the people that live in the neighborhoods that were most vulnerable are black and poor,'' he said. ''So it comes down to a lack of sensitivity on the part of people in Washington that you need to help poor folks. It's as simple as that.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE VICTIMS"
"Americans are opening their wallets, homes and hearts to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina in an outpouring expected to rival the response to the Asian tsunami and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, with donations and pledges from individuals and businesses already nearing $100 million by midday yesterday. The American Red Cross, which is leading the relief effort, had received $71 million by the end of Wednesday, more than half the $130 million it has promised to raise and two-thirds of the $109 million collected for the four hurricanes that hit Florida last year combined. The group's Help Now Web site had 150,000 hits, the most for one day in its history, on Wednesday, and has been deluged at its local offices with offers of volunteers, many of whom are being turned away for lack of training. ''It eclipses everything right now,'' said Ryland Dodge, a Red Cross spokesman. Television announced plans for several celebrity-studded telethons -- tonight on NBC, Tuesday on all major broadcast networks simultaneously and Sept. 10 on MTV -- while Jerry Lewis's Labor Day extravaganza for muscular dystrophy has promised $1 million for hurricane victims. Corporations opened their coffers, led by $10 million from UnitedHealth Group's foundation, and many matched money with material: Kellogg sent seven truckloads of NutriGrain bars, crackers and cookies south, U-Haul offered 30 days of free storage to affected families and Nissan said it would lend 50 full-size trucks for a month. The chief executive of Delta Airlines flew from Atlanta to New Orleans on Wednesday in a 757 stuffed with 20,000 pounds of cots, blankets, food, generators and toilet paper, and returned with 150 stranded employees and passengers. In Duluth, Minn., the mayor yesterday asked each of the 87,000 residents -- and those in surrounding towns -- to give $10 each, in hopes of raising $1 million in a week. In Pasadena, Calif., Red Cross volunteers had collected $155,963 from 1,500 cars by noon in a daylong ''drive-by fund-raiser'' at the Rose Bowl, where one man brought a water-cooler bottle filled with pennies he had saved over 15 years. In Parkland, Fla., students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have ordered 4,000 strands of Mardi Gras beads they plan to sell for $2 each starting today in hopes of igniting a new fad to rival the ubiquitous yellow rubber ''Livestrong'' bracelets. David Grad, the school's student government adviser and athletic director, said, ''In light of the devastation, let's stand behind the philosophy of partying and use the concept because we can't have any partying now.'' President Bush, who appointed his father and former President Bill Clinton yesterday to lead fund-raising efforts for the hurricane as they did in the aftermath of the tsunami, said in his speech to the nation Wednesday, ''At this stage in the recovery efforts, it's important for those who want to contribute to contribute cash.'' But many people said that the vastness of the devastation, the fact that many of the victims seemed so desperately poor, and personal connections to New Orleans compelled them to go beyond the instinctive act of writing a check. Memories of honeymoons in the French Quarter, revelry at Mardi Gras parades and even debauched evenings downing the city's signature rum-and-lime-juice cocktail, the Hurricane, have made Hurricane Katrina touch Americans more deeply. ''I've been to New Orleans, I know people who are living there -- it seems more personal,'' said Susie Meredith, 32, a law student in Grosse Pointe, Mich., who posted a message on www.katrinahelp.com offering to make long-distance telephone calls or run errands for displaced people. ''It's Americans. It's me.'' Thousands of families -- from millionaires with mansions in Marin County, Calif., to a machine operator willing to have people pitch tents in his backyard in rural North Carolina -- have posted messages on the Internet inviting refugees to stay with them or move permanently to their towns. Many have offered to drive toward the disaster zone to pick up refugees; Gaea Walters, 28, a systems engineer in Monroe, La., was headed last night to a shelter at the local civic center in search of a three-member family to fill her extra bedroom and bathroom for the foreseeable future. Ms. Walters said she was once unemployed and on government assistance. ''Now I'm in a position where I can help somebody, and I'm just dying to be able to,'' she said. On www.nola.com, the Web site for The Times-Picayune, the New Orleans daily, employers offered the newly jobless the next line on their résumés: carpenters and roofers are wanted in Montana, nurses in Virginia, skilled machinists in St. Petersburg, Fla., and a nanny on Staten Island. On craigslist.com, people in Kansas and Texas offered to stable abandoned horses; a certified rescue diver in Florida offered to dive for bodies in the flooded streets of New Orleans; a pilot offered to help with his small plane; and several people offered frequent-flier miles. A company based in Indianapolis that sells equipment to destroy medical and biological waste, WR2, is ready to adopt a family, promising a $50,000-a-year job, an apartment, new clothes, groceries and a car. ''If 1,000 companies in Indiana alone do this, then 4,000 people can regain hope,'' said Laurie Farris, executive administrator of the company, where 3 of the 53 employees are New Orleans natives. ''If, nationally, 50,000 companies do this, then 200,000 people can begin their life again, and we would then be making a major impact at addressing this problem.'' The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper that tracks charitable giving, said contributions exploded late Wednesday and early yesterday, putting the hurricane on pace to equal or exceed the amounts raised for the tsunami and the Sept. 11 attacks. About a third of the total has come from corporations, which gave 26 percent of the $2.7 billion after the terrorist attacks and 37 percent of the $1.5 billion raised for tsunami relief. Already Chevron, which has extensive operations in the Gulf Coast, has pledged $5 million in cash; Dow Chemical $3 million, including $1 million in products and technology; Wal-Mart and Exxon $2 million each. Mattel announced it would send $100,000 to the Red Cross -- plus thousands of toys to hurricane refugees in temporary shelters.

"A 750-gallon fuel tank was all that stood between J. Douglas Thornton and a deadly panic inside the Superdome. With only two hours' worth of gasoline left, and with water rapidly threatening to overwhelm the fuel tank and the emergency generator it powered, Mr. Thornton, who has managed the Superdome for the last eight years, knew that the consequences of a total blackout could be catastrophic. The National Guardsmen and New Orleans officers who tried to maintain some semblance of order in the Superdome as 24,000 evacuees from Hurricane Katrina were brought in had warned Mr. Thornton that if the lights blew out, a chaotic stampede could ensue. With just an hour of spare power remaining, soldiers peeled a hole out of a sheet-metal wall to allow the insertion of a hose linked to a commandeered fuel truck and used dozens of sandbags -- intended to help close the levees that had broken earlier that morning -- to create a makeshift dam around the generator. Mr. Thornton spent four nights -- Aug. 28 to 31 -- at the Superdome with about 35 employees and their 250 relatives. He recounted the harrowing situation, and the scene of misery inside the 72,000-seat stadium, in an interview here on Wednesday. His home in New Orleans was destroyed, but he said work had kept him too busy to worry about it. He manages six other state-owned sites in Louisiana, including the River Center in Baton Rouge and Lamar-Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales, both now shelters for evacuees. After spending four sleepless nights in the Superdome, Mr. Thornton, 46, fled Thursday morning, as the first hungry and dirty refugees were taken away in buses. ''I had one day to decompress and think about that, and I cried,'' he said. ''You're not human if you don't shed a tear.'' Mr. Thornton arrived at the dome around noon on Aug. 28, hours after Mayor C. Ray Nagin asked people to gather there if they had no way to evacuate the city. As 10,000 people streamed into the stadium, Mr. Thornton tried to calm them. That evening, the stadium staff and National Guard used the loudspeakers, which still worked, to warn them that power might go out but that they would be safe from the waters and be given enough food and water. ''Sunday was not a bad day,'' he said. ''It wasn't bad until we lost power.'' That occurred at 6:15 a.m. Monday, Aug. 29. Generators kicked on, but most nooks and crevices in the sprawling complex were cast into darkness. ''We went from full power to minimum power,'' Mr. Thornton said. Throughout the day, as the hurricane's destruction became apparent, Mr. Thornton tried to keep the situation manageable as evacuees continued to pour in. ''People were actually wading up to the dome in waist-deep water,'' he said. ''The National Guard were not turning them away, they were bringing them in by the truckloads.'' Inside the stadium, a few signs of despair emerged. A man jumped or was pushed off a pedestrian bridge, falling to his death. Evacuees kept arriving on buses, high-water vehicles and helicopters. The 41,000 meals ready to eat that were available Sunday afternoon were gone in a day; the military continued to bring more food and water in, pallet after pallet. On Tuesday morning, during a briefing with National Guard officers, Mr. Thornton broke out in a sweat. Water from Lake Pontchartrain was filling the city. The emergency generator behind the Superdome was just 30 to 36 inches above street level. ''If the generator power goes out, it's pitch dark and you've got 20,000 people in that building that cannot see,'' he said. ''We were worried about a panic situation.'' It was 10:30 a.m., the generator had been running for over 24 hours and would be depleted by noon. Col. Douglas Mouton, who oversaw National Guard forces in the stadium, sent two engineers and two mechanics to find a way to get fresh fuel into the tank. The engineers jury-rigged a rubber hose to be watertight, inserted it through a hole in the wall protecting the generator, and attached it to a 2,500-gallon fuel tank. There were only 1,000 gallons left. Meanwhile, Mr. Thornton said, guardsmen unloaded sandbags from a helicopter and 17 New Orleans police cadets ''dammed up'' the generator, which was in a pool of ankle-deep water. At the height of the flooding, there was only six inches to spare. Wednesday was the worst day. That morning, water pressure started dropping -- first in the upper levels, then level by level until all the building was without running water or toilets that could flush. As the plumbing collapsed, officials inside the Superdome were told repeatedly that 400 buses were being readied to carry people away. ''It just kept being delayed,'' Mr. Thornton said. Meanwhile, he was told, the population inside the dome reached 24,000. On Thursday morning, a fire burst out near a kitchen on an upper level of the dome. ''The general population wanted out of there,'' Mr. Thornton said. ''They started pushing and shoving to get out of the main doors. The National Guard, fearing for people's safety, didn't want to keep them compressed in that building and allowed the perimeter to grow.'' Mr. Thornton and his staff were told to evacuate their offices at once. He escaped on a private helicopter. Mr. Thornton returned to the Superdome on Monday. Seventy percent of the roof was ruined. Jagged sheets of rubber debris -- the outer layer protecting the roof -- had torn off. Water seeped through the two-inch-thick polyurethane foam layer underneath and even past the sheet-metal coating that shields the structure's critical steel frame, which is intact. The football field was ruined, and ceiling tiles and drywall were soaked through with sewage. He worries about the other facilities he manages. He knows that he will probably never again see some of his employees. ''We knew we were at the center of a national tragedy, and that the dome had been severely damaged, with a lot of questions about its future,'' he said. ''For those of us who have spent so much time in that building -- so many memories -- it's just heartbreaking.'' STORM AND CRISIS: SUPERDOME"
"Mayor C. Ray Nagin has ordered her out, for her own good. But Michelle Loranger does not want to leave her flood-battered city. Sitting beside two of her neighbors on the front steps of a tidy house on Desire Street, in the working-class Bywater neighborhood, Ms. Loranger said Wednesday that she would not voluntarily leave New Orleans. Her home, on high ground near the Mississippi River, survived the flood with only moderate damage, and she has plenty of food and water, she said. ''They can't throw me out of my house,'' Ms. Loranger said. ''I own property here, and I have dogs and stuff.'' Like many other residents in the city's dry zones near the river, Ms. Loranger appeared to be healthy and said she had taken reasonable precautions against the water-and insect-borne diseases that city officials say will soon be rampant here. She avoids the city's poisoned water and has cleaned debris from around her house. Ms. Loranger said she did not understand how police officers, federal agents or National Guard troops could force her out. ''There's no right for them to try to make me leave my own home,'' she said. ''They shouldn't be harassing us for staying. Isn't this still the United States of America?'' Neighbors seconded Ms. Loranger's opinion, saying they had banded together during Hurricane Katrina and the floods that followed and should be allowed to stay. Other residents appeared resigned to leaving. ''They're going to have to drag me out kicking, screaming and fighting all the way,'' Melvin Johnson, who is living in a dry house on St. Claude Avenue in the same neighborhood, said Wednesday. Mr. Johnson said he could not abandon his two dogs, and like some other residents, he hoped to find a job as the city's cleanup progressed. ''There's going to be work in this town,'' he said. ''I need it. I've lost everything I own.'' But by late afternoon on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson said he had arranged to take his dogs with him and would leave the city. ''I don't want to leave, but it's best that I leave,'' he said, citing the heavy presence of soldiers and National Guard troops, who he said were becoming jittery. STORM AND CRISIS: STAYING PUT"
"As government officials and relief organizations in the South scrambled to harbor evacuees from areas hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina, the oldest, most traditional rescue groups most people know came to life -- families. From neighboring Texas to New York and California, they have put together powerful networks, taking in and caring for their own. In quickly assembled households, sons and daughters took responsibility for out-of-work parents, parents sought school records for children needing to enroll in different states, or set up bank accounts for displaced adult relatives. As morning unfolds in Sean Brocks's cramped, three-bedroom apartment in West Dallas these days, 17 bleary-eyed adults, teenagers and children take turns at the small kitchen table for breakfast dished up by a hurricane evacuee and extended family member, Frederick King. Mr. King and nine members of his family, along with their cocker spaniel, Sheeba, have slept on the floor and a couch and a chair in the apartment for more than a week. Almost every day another member of his extended family arrives, each with another harrowing tale of escape. Last Thursday it was his sister, Ilean King, a heart technician, who rode out the storm at Memorial Hospital and stayed to care for patients for four more days before getting out on a fishing boat with her 11-year-old nephew. Weak from hunger and dehydration, the two made their way to an Air Force transport plane that flew them to Texas, where Ms. King was admitted to a hospital. ''I went from helping people to almost dying myself,'' she said. Then Ms. Brocks's second cousin Koyreinon Brocks, 17, and her 8-month-old baby arrived, after being rescued from an interstate in New Orleans where they had lived on Gatorade, bottled water and crackers for three days. Now they all wait together, watching CNN and hoping for word from the more than two dozen relatives last seen in New Orleans. ''I can't think straight,'' said Ms. King. ''Last night I slept with my head on the kitchen table.'' When the noise of 17 people gets too much for Mr. King, 32, he seeks a little peace on the staircase. ''I was telling a friend that I just keep thinking I'm going to wake up from this dream,'' he said. ''And he told me to wake up fast because we have no where to go.'' New Orleans West The first of Cassandra Epuna's relatives to trickle in from New Orleans went straight from the Los Angeles airport to another ''New Orleans'' -- Ms. Epuna's Cajun and creole restaurant in Hermosa Beach, Calif. Ms. Epuna stopped frying beignets to wrap her arms tightly around the arrival, her 48-year-old cousin, Barbara Griffin. ''You just don't know what I've been through,'' said Ms. Griffin, who flew in from temporary housing in a Houston hotel. She will stay with an older sister and her family in Redondo Beach. Ms. Epuna 46, with a four-bedroom house in Palos Verdes that she shares with her husband and her 15-year-old daughter, is ready to put up three of the eight or so more relatives standing by in Texas. ''As long as I have food, I don't care,'' she said. Ms. Epuna, who left New Orleans as a teenager, said she expected some difficulties. ''These are depressed people,'' she said, ''and to know they've lost everything they've had, you'll have to deal with mood swings.'' Ms. Griffin, over a bowl of steaming gumbo, told of swimming in dirty water, of hearing water when she goes to sleep and of feeling dirty even after she showers. ''When your hygiene gets like that, it's shameful,'' she said, now in a clean T-shirt, shorts and tennis shoes. She broke down and could not finish. ''I know I'll need some days to myself to think this over and face reality,'' she said. ''But I don't want to be around many too many people.'' Ms. Epuna has still not heard from her 10 other relatives, though she knows for sure of one aunt who made it out O.K. She knows how to help her feel welcome -- she will put her to work at the restaurant. ''She cooks awesome,'' Ms. Epuna said. An Unexpected Reunion Marci and Scott Greenberg were close to emptying the nest in their two-story four-bedroom house in Winter Park, Fla., near Orlando, when Hurricane Katrina united three generations under one roof. First to arrive were Ms. Greenberg's sister, Shellie Jacobson, and her husband, Terry, from Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. Then, as conditions worsened, Ms. Greenberg and Ms. Jacobson evacuated their 96-year-old grandmother, Rose Mansberg, from an assisted living center in Baton Rouge. Ms. Mansberg is sleeping in a bedroom downstairs and the Jacobsons have taken over the second floor. On Friday night, the family sat down for a Shabbat dinner, a reminder of the weekly meals they shared when they all lived in New Orleans. Ms. Greenberg , who said the arrival of her sister and brother-in-law had awakened her joy of cooking, proudly noted that she made the brisket and noodle kugel. But the reality of the situation is sinking in. Mr. Jacobson, a partner in an accounting firm he helped found, wrote his first résumé in 29 years last Tuesday. Later that day, he lined up an interview at an Orlando firm that hires temporary accountants. Then he bought slacks, a shirt, a tie and some shoes. After nearly three decades in his own practice, he was so nervous that he arrived for his interview an hour and a half early. He accepted an offer to start work this week, helping a local firm prepare tax returns. He hopes he will be able to go back to his own practice in a few months but is filled with fears. ""What if my practice isn't there and my clients don't come back?'' he said ''You think, 'Oh my gosh, I've worked all these years, I'm 50, and it's almost like starting over again.''' STORM AND CRISIS: FAMILIES"
"In a stunning turnaround for some of the most besieged victims of Hurricane Katrina, the Astrodome population dwindled to about 3,000 on Wednesday from an estimated 15,000 over the weekend, with many people seizing on local job opportunities and inexpensive housing. Because of a building boom over the last few years, there is a glut of affordable housing in Houston and its metropolitan area, which includes about 4.5 million people. Hotels are also offering a 14-day stay at no charge to storm victims, with reimbursements to come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Add the outpouring of offers of shelter across the country and an acknowledgment by the government that the original estimates may have been high, and it appears that the Astrodome might be empty soon. Frank E. Gutierrez, the emergency management coordinator for Harris County, which covers Houston, said that Joe Leonard, the area commander for the Department of Homeland Security, had made it a goal to clear the shelter complex by Sept. 18. ''Everyone was asking him, 'What if we don't make it?''' Mr. Gutierrez said, ''And he said, 'Then I'll need to work harder.''' Even though many of those in the Astrodome seem to be bracing for a long stay -- and the dome is gaining the trappings of normal life, with its own post office, Internet cafe and medical center -- it looks increasingly like a temporary society. And many of the evacuees are opting to stay in Houston or nearby towns. Evacuees in the dome rejected an offer this week from FEMA to transfer 4,000 people to cruise ships in the harbor of Galveston. ''I'm taking my chances in Houston, where we've already been able to accomplish a few things,'' said Linda Jeffers, 55, who is on the Survivors Leadership Group, an organization of evacuees living in the Astrodome. The group persuaded the American Red Cross this week to create a play area for children and asked officials to lobby communications companies not to turn off evacuees' cellphones. Mayor Bill White of Houston and Judge Robert Eckels of Harris County, who are leading the operations in Houston, announced that ''over 150,000 people have come to our community seeking the basic necessities of life'' and that they had established the Houston Katrina Relief Fund, with business leaders on the board to raise money. Asked if he had a goal in mind, Mayor White said: ''Yes. As much as we can.'' Bed counts by the Red Cross at other Houston shelters showed far fewer people than just days ago, with 1,800 at Reliant Arena, 2,000 at Reliant Center and 1,366 at the George R. Brown Convention Center. Earlier figures were estimates and perhaps overstated, some officials said. Including the Astrodome, about 8,000 evacuees were in Houston's largest shelters on Wednesday, down from a high of 24,000, city officials said. At least 1,300 people have moved into homes and apartments since Friday, and others have left with friends and relatives or on their own. A city plan to provide 10,000 rental units to evacuees, a program that could last a year, drew more than 200 apartment operators. Houston intends to distribute vouchers and to be reimbursed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and FEMA. City officials said landlords would waive credit checks and security deposits. ''I'm grateful to have a change,'' said Hope Joseph, 29, who moved out of the Astrodome on Tuesday night to a donated apartment in Wharton, a town south of Houston, together with her three children, ages 4, 6 and 9, and her mother, Lola. ''It's very quiet here, but I'm hoping for a fresh start in life,'' said Ms. Joseph, a former cake decorator at a Winn-Dixie supermarket in New Orleans, in a phone interview from Wharton. Carmen Scarlett, the owner of a counseling service who will temporarily pay part of the $450 rent, met Ms. Joseph after traveling to Houston to assist evacuees. At the Astrodome, small signs of comfort abound, like piles of donated clothing, land-line phones by SBC and a low-power FM radio station set to begin broadcasting on Wednesday, with as many as 10,000 radios distributed. There is also plenty of free food, including hot sandwiches from Chick-Fil-A, served by workers from Aramark, the food services company at the Astrodome. FEMA plans to distribute $2,000 debit cards to each adult displaced by Katrina, sparking considerable discussion in the dome about where to place automatic teller machines. Members of the Survivors Leadership Group suggested a location outside the dome in well-lighted areas. ''There's still some agitation inside here, but it feels like it's calming down a bit,'' said Charles Adams, 47, a former cook at Dickie Brennan's Steakhouse in New Orleans. ''It's still the old, 'You're not getting nothing unless you demand it.''' The impression of normalcy at the Astrodome, however, was betrayed by reminders of how unstable life remains for many evacuees. Signs in the medical center alerted people about an onset of dysentery, apparently caused by norovirus, known for causing sicknesses on cruise ships. Even though phones are available in the dome, Glenn Levy, a 16-year-old evacuee, described strong demand for a functioning cellphone. He said that he charges people three cigarettes for three minutes on his cell and had garnered as many as 50 Kool and Camel cigarettes a day. ''My minutes are not free,'' said Mr. Levy, who said he did not know the whereabouts of his father and mother, a sister and two brothers, though he had reached one sister in New Orleans. ''I'm trying not to think they died.'' STORM AND CRISIS: HOUSTON"
"Peter, a yellow cockatiel, came through the door of the Houston animal shelter from New Orleans perched on his owner's finger. With pets barred from the bus trip, Lola, a green parrot, made it hidden inside her owner's bra. And the Great Dane? Well, no one is quite sure about him. The Houston S.P.C.A. has opened its doors to almost 900 animals in recent days, including cats, dogs, parrots, iguanas, a pig and, even temporarily, a pet chick named Lucy, all belonging to hurricane survivors from Louisiana who are in homes and shelters in Houston that do not allow pets. ''It's become our disaster by default,'' said Patricia E. Mercer, the president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals here. In addition to untold numbers of pets killed, animals made homeless by the hurricane are wandering hungry and confused throughout the Gulf Coast. Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, said, ''In New Orleans alone, we think there are 50,000 pets.'' Jane Garrison, who is working with a Humane Society rescue team in New Orleans, said her best rescue was on Wednesday, when she heard a dog's cries and looked up to see a Labrador mix marooned on the second-story awning of a house that was completely crumbled. ''We went up by ladder and threw a leash around her neck,'' Ms. Garrison said. ''She jumped down into my partner's arms and immediately started licking her.'' The Houston S.P.C.A. sent a staff member along with six members of Florida's Broward County chapter to New Orleans to pick up homeless animals. ''Hundreds of people, if not thousands around the country, are working to save animals,'' Ms. Mercer said. Louisiana State University has 300 animals, she said, and 500 are being housed in Gonzales, La. Jacque Meyer, executive director of the Greater Birmingham Humane Society who is in Jackson, Miss., to help, said 30 dogs from the Gulfport, Miss., region whose owners were killed were rounded up on Tuesday. Some groups, like the North Shore Animal League on Long Island, have helped by taking animals previously held in shelters in the hurricane areas to make room for more animals, Ms. Meyer said. The effort to find animals can be slow and sometimes unpredictable, said Dino Vlachos, an animal rescuer from Atlanta who is in New Orleans. ''We just completed a rescue off the French Quarter where we were told there were 62 cats,'' Mr. Vlachos said Wednesday. ''But when we got there we found 62 birds and two goats.'' He estimates that they have picked up 200 dogs and 250 cats since Monday. ''But we need help,'' he said. To join the effort, volunteers have to register with the Humane Society at 1-800-HUMANE (1-800-486-2631). Mr. Pacelle said: ''The clock is ticking. We've had 2,000 calls from people who have left their pets behind. We're too late for some, but we may be just in time for others.'' Mr. Pacelle said the Humane Society was ''not getting the help we need from local, state and the federal government.'' ''There are policemen and firemen out there who want to help,'' he said, ''but the order on high is to help people, not pets. Three days from now, there will be massive die offs.'' Initially, the society's efforts were directed at picking up animals at the Houston Astrodome, and 400 owned animals at the Houston shelter now, Ms. Mercer said, were picked up by volunteers who met rescue buses at the Astrodome, Reliant Park and the George R. Brown Convention Center. The center has taken in animals from evacuees who found the shelter on their own. Patricia Simmons, 47, a nurse from New Orleans, was one of them. Ms. Simmons stood in the lobby of the shelter on Monday holding a leash without a dog attached to it. She and her roommate, Deneen Taylor, had just bid a bittersweet goodbye to their dogs, Tiffany, 11m a Rottweiler-Doberman mix, and Cocoa, 1, a chow, because there was no room for them at Ms. Taylor's family home in Houston. Nettie Hock was also at the S.P.C.A. with her mother, also named Nettie Hock, and her brother, Raymond. The family had come to visit Tanya, their 3-year-old bright-eyed Pekingese who was soon to be given a foster home by Michael Stanley, a lawyer from Sugar Land; his wife, Terrice; and their three children. The Stanleys met the family while they were volunteering at the Astrodome and were struck by how traumatized the elderly Mrs. Hock was without her beloved dog. ''She was sitting there in suspended animation,'' Mr. Stanley whispered, shaking his head. Ms. Mercer said the shelter was close to its capacity of 800 animals. Three off-site overflow centers are open, and the group is working with others around the country to find space. Although none of the pets who have owners will be put up for adoption, the shelter hopes to find foster homes for the animals where they can be cared for until their owners are able to take them back. In the meantime, accounts trickle in of how pets and their owners escaped the wrath of the storm. A woman who came to claim her chow told Ms. Mercer, ''We swam out together, and she didn't give up on me, and I'm not giving up on her.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ANIMALS"
"With the waters inside this city growing increasingly fetid and thousands of people still holding out, New Orleans police officers began on Wednesday evening to force residents to leave, including those living in dry and undamaged homes. It was not clear how widespread the forced evacuations were. But earlier in the day the city's police superintendent said that while his department would concentrate first on removing those who wanted to leave, the hazards posed by fires, waterborne diseases and natural-gas leaks had left the city with no choice but to use force on those who resisted. In at least one neighborhood, Bywater, a working-class area east of the French Quarter, police officers and federal agents on Wednesday night began to press hard for residents to evacuate. At two homes, police officers and emergency service workers refused to leave until the two men living there agreed to go with them, even though both men appeared healthy and said they had adequate supplies. Until now, city and state officials have implored residents to leave, but no one has been forcibly removed. The announced change in policy -- after an evacuation order by Mayor C. Ray Nagin on Tuesday -- came even as the floodwater receded slightly and residents in some sections took small steps toward recovery, cleaning debris from their streets and boarding up abandoned houses. Some said they would fight the evacuations, potentially producing ugly confrontations. An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people remained inside New Orleans more than a week after Hurricane Katrina hit, many in neighborhoods that are on high ground near the Mississippi River. But the number of dead still remained a looming and disturbing question. In the first indication of how many deaths Louisiana alone might expect, Robert Johannessen, a spokesman for the State Department of Health and Hospitals, said on Wednesday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had ordered 25,000 body bags. The official death toll remained at under 100. In Washington, the House and Senate announced a joint investigation into the government's response to the crisis. ""Americans deserve answers,'' said a statement by the two top-ranking Republicans, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader. ''We must do all we can to learn from this tragedy, improve the system and protect all of our citizens.'' President Bush made plans to send Congress a request for $51.8 billion for relief efforts, the second such request since the storm devastated the Gulf Coast. The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said the money would include $50 billion for FEMA, $1.4 billion for the Department of Defense and $400 million for the Army Corps of Engineers. The request follows a $10.5 billion package that Mr. Bush signed on Friday and is intended to address the immediate needs of survivors. The government continued its efforts to help evacuees. At the Astrodome in Houston, where an estimated 15,000 New Orleans evacuees found shelter over the weekend, the number had dwindled to only about 3,000 on Wednesday as people were rapidly placed in apartments, volunteers' homes and hotels that had been promised reimbursement by FEMA. Michael D. Brown, the FEMA director, said his agency would begin issuing debit cards, worth at least $2,000 each, to allow hurricane victims to buy supplies for immediate needs. More than 319,000 people have already applied for federal disaster relief. ''The concept is to get them some cash in hand,'' Mr. Brown said, ''which allows them, empowers them, to make their own decisions about what they need to have to restart their lives.'' As New Orleans officials grappled with how to make residents leave, new government tests showed the danger of remaining. In the first official confirmation of contaminants in the water covering the city, federal officials said on Wednesday that they had found levels of E. coli bacteria and lead 10 times higher than is considered safe. Those were the only substances identified as potential health threats in tests of water conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency at laboratories in Houston and Lafayette, La. Officials emphasized that as testing continued more substances were likely to be found at harmful levels, especially from water taken near industrial sites. ''Human contact with the floodwater should be avoided as much as possible,'' the environmental agency's administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, said. A spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said state and local officials had reported three deaths in Mississippi and one in Texas from exposure to Vibrio vulnificus, a choleralike bacterium found in salt water, which poses special risks for people with chronic liver problems. With the overall death toll uncertain, Mr. Brown, the FEMA director, said in Baton Rouge that the formal house-to-house search for bodies had begun at midmorning. He said the temporary mortuary set up in St. Gabriel, La., was prepared to receive 500 to 1,000 bodies a day, with refrigeration trucks on site to hold the corpses. ''They will be processed as rapidly as possible,'' Mr. Brown said. As it worked to remove the water inundating the city, the Corps of Engineers said that one additional pumping station, No. 6, at the head of the 17th Street Canal, had started up, and that about 10 percent of the city's total pumping capacity was in operation. But the corps added that it was dealing with a new problem: how to prevent corpses from being sucked to the grates at the pump inlets. ''We're expending every effort to try to ensure that we protect the integrity of remains as we get this water out of the city,'' said John S. Rickey, chief of public affairs for the corps. ''We're taking this very personally. This is a very deep emotional aspect of our work down there.'' As the forcible removal of New Orleans residents also threatened to become an emotional issue, the city's superintendent of police, P. Edwin Compass III, said at a news conference on Wednesday morning that such evacuations would not begin until the police had helped the thousands of people who wanted leave. ''Once all the voluntary evacuations have taken place,'' Mr. Compass said, ''then we'll concentrate our efforts and our forces to mandatorily evacuating individuals.'' But on Wednesday night, a city police officer and a dozen heavily armed immigration agents broke into a house in Bywater without knocking or announcing their presence, saying they were looking for a looter. The house was clean and neat and the only person inside, Anthony Paul, lived there, according to his state-issued identification. Although Mr. Paul appeared to be in good health and had plenty of food and water, a psychologist with an emergency services team that was called to the house said she would not leave until Mr. Paul agreed to evacuate. The psychologist said that Mr. Paul was mentally stable, but that she wanted him to leave for his own safety. ''If I'm leaving, you guys are leaving,'' said the psychologist, who identified herself only as Rain. At one point Mr. Paul said, ''You're going to have to kill me to get me out of this house.'' But after nearly an hour, he agreed to leave and packed a single backpack. ''I didn't want to leave right now,'' he said as he prepared to board an ambulance. ''If I had a choice, yeah, I would have rode it out.'' The psychologist said that she viewed the evacuation as voluntary and that Mr. Paul would eventually appreciate that he had made the right choice. ''This is why I wake up in the morning,'' she said. Among the authorities, though, some confusion lingered on Wednesday about how a widespread evacuation by force would work, and how much support it would get at the federal and state level. Mayor Nagin told the police and the military on Tuesday to remove all residents for their own safety, and on Wednesday, Mr. Compass said state laws gave the mayor the authority to declare martial law and order the evacuations. ''There's a martial law declaration in place that gives us legal authority for mandatory evacuations,'' Mr. Compass said. ''We'll use the minimum amount of force necessary.'' But because the New Orleans Police Department has only about 1,000 working officers, the city is largely in the hands of National Guard troops and active-duty soldiers. State officials said Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco could tell the Guard to carry out the forced removals, but they stopped short of a commitment to do so. In Washington, Lt. Gen. Joseph R. Inge, deputy commander of the United States Northern Command, said regular troops ''would not be used'' in any forced evacuation. The state disaster law does not supersede either the state or federal Constitutions, said Kenneth M. Murchison, a law professor at Louisiana State University. But even so, Mr. Nagin's decision could be a smart strategy that does not violate fundamental rights, Professor Murchison said. ''What I suspect is that if they do forcible evacuations, the authorities will tell the residents that they must leave and that they will arrest them if they don't,'' Professor Murchison said. ''I would suspect that once they are moved to a location outside of New Orleans, the authorities will release them. It would then be up to the district attorney someday to decide whether to prosecute them or not. But in the meantime, the authorities sure aren't going to let anyone back in.'' Professor Murchison said that anyone even seeking to challenge the forcible evacuations on constitutional grounds would have to travel to Baton Rouge, where the federal judges from the Eastern District of Louisiana, based in New Orleans, have relocated. While many New Orleans residents said they would not go gently, others appeared disheveled, weak and ready to evacuate. Sitting under an umbrella in a filthy parking lot at the eastern edge of Bywater, Anthony Washington said on Wednesday morning that he worried he would not be able to reach his family if he left the city. But after a reporter offered him the chance to call his sister and explain where he was, he said he would leave. By midafternoon Mr. Washington had boarded a bus for the city's convention center, where evacuees were being taken. ''I don't have nothing here,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"In the history of humankind, there has rarely been a disaster like the New Orleans flood without a theodicy to go along with it. The word ''theodicy,'' coined in the 18th century by the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, derives from Greek roots invoking the ''justice of the gods.'' A theodicy is an attempt to show that such justice exists, to prove that we really do live in what Leibniz insisted was the ''best of all possible worlds.'' So theodicies have been plentiful after earthquakes, floods and droughts. Explanations are readily offered: disasters are the wages of sin, they herald an apocalyptic age, they cleanse the earth of evil. Theodicies aim to demonstrate that devastation does not really disrupt or overturn our understanding of the moral and social order. Instead, disorder provides evidence of order. The theodicy is that order. It explains forces that seem to lie beyond human powers, evils that lie beyond human cause. Theodicies are not casual matters, and in the weeks after Katrina, they are bound to evolve, even in secular culture, even when they may not resemble the ones that Leibniz had in mind. So they need to be better understood. The classic theodicies in the West are biblical. The flood of Noah's time, for example, is a reflection of the divine will, cleansing the earth of humanity's evil. A more powerful theodicy later evolved out of the trials of the ancient Israelites, in which destruction and exile were treated not as random accidents of history, but as forms of retribution for violating the Mosaic law and its ethical consequences. Suffering could become proof of divine attention and not its opposite. Scholars like Norman Cohn have shown how in medieval Europe the worst human trauma could be interpreted as proof of imminent apocalypse and redemption, inspiring millennial expectations and movements. Meanwhile, the theodicy of divine retribution still thrives today and was invoked by some fundamentalist believers after Katrina. But between medieval Europe and contemporary America something profound changed in the way natural disasters are interpreted and the kinds of theodicies they inspire. And one of the turning points, as many scholars have argued, was the 1755 earthquake in Lisbon. It destroyed perhaps a third of the city's population, with deaths in the tens of thousands. It overturned the confidence of European royalty and seemed to drive a wedge between the earthly and divine realms. For the growing forces of the Enlightenment, it also seemed to overturn the very idea that a theodicy could account for the disaster. Voltaire, who had once seen nature as benevolent, was whipped into a rationalist fury by the experience. Leibniz, he believed, had been refuted by nature. Voltaire wrote a ''Poem on the Disaster of Lisbon'' in which the quake's victims are called ''Tormented atoms on a heap of muck/ That death devours and that fate trips up.'' His character Candide watches the earthquake from a distance, seeing it as morally blind, killing the good and preserving the wicked. In a sense, the earthquake actually ended up strengthening the hand of the Enlightenment, as if a replacement theodicy had fallen into place. Kant wrote about the quake. Scientific investigation took place. The response of Portugal's prime minister to the disaster was practical, not religious. ''We will bury the dead,'' he said, ''and take care of the living.'' Recently, the philosopher Susan Neiman argued in ''Evil in Modern Thought'' that the Lisbon earthquake also destroyed an ancient idea that nature could itself be evil. After Lisbon, she argued, moral evil was distinguished from natural disaster. Earthquakes and floods could no longer be fitted into traditional religious theodicies. But this did not mean, of course, that theodicies faded away. Ms. Neiman argued that for philosophers theology had been replaced by history. The fates of peoples and nations reflected other forces, and disruptions were given other forms of explanation. Hegel saw history as an evolutionary series of transformations in which destruction was as inevitable as birth. Marx believed other kinds of economic and human laws accounted for destruction and evolution. This mostly left natural disasters for the growing realm of science: if they couldn't be prevented, at least their origins could be understood. Now though, with the prospect of thousands of dead becoming plausible with reports from New Orleans, other forms of theodicy also taking shape. Much debate is taking place about the scale of human tragedy, about procedures and planning and responsibility. And none of that should be ignored. But it is remarkable how this natural disaster has almost imperceptibly come to seem the result of human agency, as if failures in planning were almost evidence of cause, as if forces of nature were subject to human oversight. The hurricane has been humanized. I don't want to push this too far, of course; human actions, as the Portuguese prime minister knew, are crucial. But this is still an important change in our views of the natural world. In a way, it inflates human knowledge. It confidently extends scientific and political power into the realm of nature. It doesn't really explain catastrophe, but it attempts to explain why we are forced to experience it: because of human failings. There is a theodicy at work here, in the ways in which the reaction to natural catastrophe so readily becomes political. Nature becomes something to be managed or mismanaged; it lies within the political order, not outside it. Theodicy, if successful, does not overturn belief but confirms it. So, for some commentators, the flood and its aftermath provided confirmation of their previous doubts about the Bush adminstration. Actually, in some respects, this theodicy has gone even beyond the political: just as a religious theodicy might have shown natural catastrophe to be the result of human misdeed, many of the early commentators about the flood did the same, creating a kind of scientific/moral theodicy in which human sin is still a dominant factor. Last week, for example, Germany's minister of the environment, Jürgen Trittin, said: ''The American president has closed his eyes to the economic and human damage that natural catastrophes such as Katrina -- in other words, disasters caused by a lack of climate protection measures -- can visit on his country.'' All of these explanations are subject to examination and debate of course, but in the heart of a secular age, they are also something else. They are theodicies. And in the face of nature's awesome and horrific powers, the prospect of political retribution is as prevalent as the promise of divine retribution once was. CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"
"Even if it was not clear to anyone else in the government, the Marines had figured they would be needed when Hurricane Katrina struck. ''Before the hurricane, I already told my guys to get ready,'' said Lt. Col. Kent S. Ralston, whose amtracks from the Fourth Assault Amphibian Battalion, manned mostly by reservists, were soon grinding across highways from bases in Tampa and Jacksonville, Fla.; Norfolk, Va.; and Gulfport, Miss. Now amtracks -- amphibious assault vehicles, which look like the spawn of a tugboat and a tank -- are sloshing through water 18 feet deep in a New Orleans residential area along Lake Pontchartrain east of the city center. Aboard, in full battle gear, are infantry from Company B, First Battalion, Eighth Marines, flown in from Camp Lejeune, N.C. Just last fall, they were in the forefront of bloody fighting in Falluja. With the damage already done and the bulk of the area evacuated, it is not clear what effect the marines can have on the swath of destruction wrought by the hurricane. The amtrack commanded by Master Sgt. Eric White patrolled for more than eight hours under a grueling sun the other day, crisscrossing middle-class residential streets on the eastern edge of the city and occasionally lurching over abandoned cars now submerged. But the only person the crew encountered was a white-bearded, obstinate Elmore Hays, in a pedal boat, who rebuffed calls to leave. Still, the marines have rescued about 500 stranded people since last Thursday. With about 1,700 of them on the ground here and more on the way, Maj. Gen. Douglas V. O'Dell Jr., commander of the relief task force, said they would now be concentrating much of their efforts in St. Bernard Parish -- in the storm's direct path and 90 percent inundated -- and the neighboring Arabi district. In addition to search and rescue, they will provide food and water, as well as limited medical evacuation, and work to recover bodies. ''The tempo of this moment is beginning to increase greatly,'' General O'Dell said in an interview late Wednesday afternoon between continual planning meetings. The nucleus of the task force is the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. In the shorthand jargon that peppers military talk, its executive officer, Lt. Col. Dan Kelly, said of the events of early last week, ''We had S.A.'': situational awareness. ''Right after the hurricane, we briefed the staff,'' Colonel Kelly said. '''Get the packs ready, get stuff together.''' The huge logistical effort has so far brought 18,000 meals ready to eat and nearly 60,000 quarts of water with the marines. National guardsmen, as well as regular Army troops from the 82nd Airborne and First Cavalry Divisions, many of them veterans of Iraq, have also been deployed. This base some 10 miles south of New Orleans -- ordered evacuated on Aug. 27, two days before the hurricane swept ashore, according to a sign taped to a door -- is now a bustle of activity, with troops of all kinds. The airfield looks like a Woodstock of helicopters: craft of various sizes buzz about. Discussing the deployment, General O'Dell and other officers spoke of the Marines' ability to mix and match various units, including those of the Reserves, to form a task force tailored to a particular problem. In this case, amphibious vehicle detachments -- among them a Gulfport unit that went into action almost immediately in Mississippi -- were crucial because of their ability to swim or crawl over obstacles. (The vehicles were actually designed for hurricane rescue in the 1930's, Colonel Ralston noted, when they were called Roebling Alligators.) General O'Dell, stationed in New Orleans in his usual role as commander of the Fourth Marine Division, said he was told a day before the storm to begin planning but had already begun the night before that. ''I wanted to facilitate a very rapid response,'' the general said. ''I wish it had been quicker. The movement of large amounts of cargo takes time and does not happen at light speed.'' Colonel Kelly, of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit -- a land-air strike force deployed aboard ships -- said it had sent a 10-man team by last Thursday to begin setting up a headquarters, which grew to 80 marines by Saturday. Two ships, the Shreveport and the Whidbey Island, were loaded with about 300 marines and heavy equipment like trucks, forklifts and bulldozers. A battalion of 700 marines from Camp Lejeune marched off transport planes at tiny Stennis International Airport in Bay St. Louis, Miss., on Sunday afternoon and began making its way west. Another battalion of regulars, from Camp Pendleton, Calif., was dispatched along with reservists from the 14th Field Artillery Regiment. Late Monday afternoon, amtracks and the Company B marines from Camp Lejeune pulled into the parking lot of a NASA facility east of New Orleans. Half or more of the company had engaged in the fighting at Falluja; one young marine proudly displayed a bullet hole in the back of his Kevlar vest. They bivouacked on the concrete floor, and, as they slept, some tossed and moaned with nightmares. STORM AND CRISIS: TROOPS"
"In the downtown business district here, on a dry stretch of Union Street, past the Omni Bank automated teller machine, across from a parking garage offering ''early bird'' rates: a corpse. Its feet jut from a damp blue tarp. Its knees rise in rigor mortis. Six National Guardsmen walked up to it on Tuesday afternoon and two blessed themselves with the sign of the cross. One soldier took a parting snapshot like some visiting conventioneer, and they walked away. New Orleans, September 2005. Hours passed, the dusk of curfew crept, the body remained. A Louisiana state trooper around the corner knew all about it: murder victim, bludgeoned, one of several in that area. The police marked it with traffic cones maybe four days ago, he said, and then he joked that if you wanted to kill someone here, this was a good time. Night came, then this morning, then noon, and another sun beat down on a dead son of the Crescent City. That a corpse lies on Union Street may not shock; in the wake of last week's hurricane, there are surely hundreds, probably thousands. What is remarkable is that on a downtown street in a major American city, a corpse can decompose for days, like carrion, and that is acceptable. Welcome to New Orleans in the post-apocalypse, half baked and half deluged: pestilent, eerie, unnaturally quiet. Scraggly residents emerge from waterlogged wood to say strange things, and then return into the rot. Cars drive the wrong way on the Interstate and no one cares. Fires burn, dogs scavenge, and old signs from les bons temps have been replaced with hand-scrawled threats that looters will be shot dead. The incomprehensible has become so routine here that it tends to lull you into acceptance. On Sunday, for example, several soldiers on Jefferson Highway had guns aimed at the heads of several prostrate men suspected of breaking into an electronics store. A car pulled right up to this tense scene and the driver leaned out his window to ask a soldier a question: ''Hey, how do you get to the interstate?'' Maybe the slow acquiescence to the ghastly here -- not in Baghdad, not in Rwanda, here -- is rooted in the intensive news coverage of the hurricane's aftermath: floating bodies and obliterated towns equal old news. Maybe the concerns of the living far outweigh the dignity of a corpse on Union Street. Or maybe the nation is numb with post-traumatic shock. Wandering New Orleans this week, away from news conferences and search-and-rescue squads, has granted haunting glimpses of the past, present and future, with the rare comfort found in, say, the white sheet that flaps, not in surrender but as a vow, at the corner of Poydras Street and St. Charles Avenue. ''We Shall Survive,'' it says, as though wishing past the battalions of bulldozers that will one day come to knock down water-corrupted neighborhoods and rearrange the Louisiana mud for the infrastructure of an altogether different New Orleans. Here, then, the New Orleans of today, where open fire hydrants gush the last thing needed on these streets; where one of the many gag-inducing smells -- that of rancid meat -- is better than MapQuest in pinpointing the presence of a market; and where images of irony beg to be noticed. The Mardi Gras beads imbedded in mud by a soldier's boot print. The ''take-away'' signs outside restaurants taken away. The corner kiosk shouting the Aug. 28 headline of New Orleans's Times-Picayune: ''Katrina Takes Aim.'' Rush hour in downtown now means pickups carrying gun-carrying men in sunglasses, S.U.V.'s loaded with out-of-town reporters hungry for action, and the occasional tank. About the only ones commuting by bus are dull-eyed suspects shuffling two-by-two from the bus-and-train terminal, which is now a makeshift jail. Maybe some of them had helped to kick in the portal to the Williams Super Market in the once-desirable Garden District. And who could blame them if all they wanted was food in those first desperate days? The interlopers took the water, beer, cigarettes and snack food. They did not take the wine or the New Orleans postcards. On the other side of downtown across Canal Street in the French Quarter, the most raucous and most unreal of American avenues is now little more than an empty alley with balconies. The absence of sweetly blown jazz, of someone cooing ''ma chère,'' of men sporting convention nametags and emitting forced guffaws -- the absence of us -- assaults the senses more than any smell. Past the famous Cafe du Monde, where a slight breeze twirls the overhead fans for no one, past the statue of Joan of Arc gleaming gold, a man emerges from nothing on Royal Street. He is asked, ''Where's St. Bernard Avenue?'' ''Where's the ice?'' he asks in return, eyes narrowed in menace. ''Where's the ice? St. Bernard's is that way, but where's the ice?'' In Bywater and the surrounding neighborhoods, the severely damaged streets bear the names of saints who could not protect them. Whatever nature spared, human nature stepped up to provide a kind of democracy in destruction. At the Whitney National Bank on St. Claude Avenue, diamond-like bits of glass spill from the crushed door, offering a view of the complementary coffee table. A large woman named Phoebe Au -- ''Pronounced 'Awe,''' she says -- materializes to report that men had smashed it in with a truck. She fades into the neighborhood's broken brick, and a thin woman named Toni Miller materializes to correct the record. ''They used sledgehammers,'' she said. Farther down St. Claude Avenue, where tanks rumble past a smoldering building, the roads are cluttered with vandalized city buses. The city parked them on the riverbank for the hurricane, after which some hoods took them for fare-free joy rides through lawless streets, and then discarded them. On Clouet Street, where a days-old fire continues to burn where a warehouse once stood, a man on a bicycle wheels up through the smoke to introduce himself as Strangebone. The nights without power or water have been tough, especially since the police took away the gun he was carrying -- ''They beat me and threatened to kill me,'' he says -- but there are benefits to this new world. ''You're able to see the stars,'' he says. ''It's wonderful.'' Today, law enforcement troops began lending muscle to Mayor C. Ray Nagin's vow to evacuate by force any residents too attached to their pieces of the toxic metropolis. They searched the streets for the likes of Strangebone, and that woman whose name sounds like Awe. Meanwhile, back downtown, the shadows of another evening crept like spilled black water over someone's corpse. STORM AND CRISIS: STREET SCENE"
"Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco told the White House it would have to wait for her decision on its proposal. Then she told them her answer was no. After huddling with her advisers late into the night last Friday and again Saturday morning, she rejected a White House proposal to consolidate the National Guard and active duty troops in the Hurricane Katrina disaster zone under a single commander appointed by the Bush administration. ''If I had seen a greater purpose, if I had felt it would make an immediate difference, it would have been a no-brainer, but by Friday, we had everything in control,'' she said in an interview in a trailer behind the state's emergency operations center. And, so, Ms. Blanco, 62, a football coach's wife and former schoolteacher and homemaker -- as unlikely a governor as any -- defied a request from the president of the United States. Whether her decision was best for her state remains to be seen, but the episode is revealing about Ms. Blanco's personality and leadership style, her advisers said. The public has glimpsed different versions of the governor over the past week and a half. After the devastation became clear, she appeared haggard and shell-shocked before television cameras while blinking back tears and calling for prayers. Later in the week, she warned looters that National Guard soldiers were on their way with ''M-16's, and they are locked and loaded.'' As a public speaker, Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, is hardly dynamic, appearing more like a friendly den mother than a seasoned politician. But beneath that exterior, which political observers say helps explain her connection with voters, is a toughness that is often underestimated, whether it is on the campaign trail or in a duck hunt, her friends and advisers said. ''We used to call it a velvet brick,'' said Lawrence St. Blanc, a longtime friend who heads the state's Public Service Commission. ''She's so smooth and nice and, wham, she'd slam that thing down.'' Her tenacity, however, can sometimes work against her, several observers of state politics said. Before the hurricane, one of Ms. Blanco's biggest challenges of the past year was pushing for a major increase in the cigarette tax to finance a $2,000 pay raise for teachers. The measure lost badly in the State Legislature and some critics faulted her for being intransigent. ''She swung for the fences but struck out,'' said John Maginnis, the publisher of a weekly political newsletter in Louisiana. ''While she has a lot of resolve, sometimes she can be stubborn or inflexible.'' The hurricane would present a formidable political challenge for any governor, but especially for Ms. Blanco, said Kirby Goidel, director of the Public Policy Research Lab at Louisiana State University. The governor narrowly won the Democratic primary, largely because two other candidates split the African-American vote, and she barely squeaked by her opponent, Congressman Bobby Jindal, in the general election. She seemed to win over some Louisianans when, in a debate, she became emotional when she spoke of losing her 19-year-old son, Ben, in a construction accident. ''She seemed to be a safe choice, the person that would be successful, but not radically different from the past,'' Mr. Goidel said. ''Now she has to make major strides.'' Ms. Blanco is from Grand Coteau, a tiny rural town in which children were more likely to speak French Cajun on the playground than English. She celebrated her Cajun roots in television advertisements when she ran for lieutenant governor, with Zydeco music blaring in the background and family members dancing on the porch. After graduating from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, she taught elementary school before quitting to raise her six children. Her husband, Raymond, coached football at the university and later became an administrator there. ''She was an excellent coach's wife,'' said Mr. Blanco. ''She was a great recruiter. We would bring players in. She would cook.'' To help make ends meet, Ms. Blanco made Christmas crafts for local shops out of the family's home. The couple eventually started a political polling business from their living room, making the calls themselves and keeping track of the results by hand. Mr. Blanco, however, was more of the political aficionado in the family, getting heavily into local politics. Ms. Blanco worked as an administrator for the United States Census in the state before suddenly deciding to run for an open seat in the State House of Representatives. ''She stood up on the side of the bed and said, 'I think I'm going to run for the local seat,''' her husband said. ''My stomach dropped.'' She won the seat in 1985 despite spending only $22,000. She served five years in the state house, and then won election to the State Public Service Commission. She was elected lieutenant governor in 1995 and re-elected in 1999. So far, she has received mixed marks for her handling of the crisis. What she requested from the federal government and when is not entirely clear. And some have faulted her for not doing more to prepare for obvious contingencies, like communications failures and the need for food and water at the Superdome. Former Gov. Buddy Roemer, a Democrat who became a Republican while in office, described Ms. Blanco's performance as ''very mixed.'' ''She has her share of the blame,'' he said, but he also faulted himself and previous governors for not doing more to educate the public on hurricanes. He has called for the resignation of the heads of FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. Ms. Blanco has been measured in her criticism of federal officials, keeping her remarks tempered compared with some of the emotional outbursts of other local officials. She insisted that she asked for help early on in several conversations with President Bush. ''I said, 'Send me everything you have,''' she said. By two days after the storm, she said, she was outraged because promised buses from FEMA had not arrived. ''It was like, they're coming, they're coming, they're coming,'' she said, her voice rising. ''On Wednesday night, I was convinced there was no such thing as a FEMA bus.'' Indeed, Ms. Blanco was on the phone herself, calling churches, private companies and others around the state, trying to get buses to evacuate people, said Sam Jones, a member of her executive staff. Because she rejected the White House's proposal, she is in control of the National Guard soldiers in Louisiana, while the president has authority over the active duty troops. She said the proposal to unify the troops under federal command amounted to bureaucratic reshuffling, when what she really needed was more resources to save lives. A White House official, who insisted on anonymity because negotiations with the state were continuing, described the plan as more power sharing than taking power from the state. For now, Ms. Blanco said, she was taking solace in small victories. On Monday, she visited a shelter here with Mr. Bush and met a woman there who had lost track of her 14-year-old son in the evacuation. On Monday evening, after her staff had found the boy in Alexandria, she personally accompanied him back to the Baton Rouge shelter to be reunited with his mother. STORM AND CRISIS: THE LOUISIANA GOVERNOR Correction: September 10, 2005, Saturday Because of an editing error, a profile on Thursday of Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, the governor of Louisiana, misidentified her birthplace in some copies. It was Coteau, La., not Grand Coteau."
"Late Monday night, with a whoosh and a thunderous rumble, the first pumps kicked in at Pumping Station 6, New Orleans's largest, and began draining water out of this sunken city and into Lake Pontchartrain. How engineers got them going is a story of adversity, ingenuity, perseverance and luck -- and the eureka moment when one of them realized he had seen a functioning stoplight, a sign that an electrical grid was functioning and could be tapped for power to run the pumps. A crucial player on the ground for the Army Corps of Engineers, which is driving the drainage effort, is Chief Warrant Officer Thomas Black. A wiry 44-year-old engineer who wears army camouflage fatigues and a regulation black beret over close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair, he says his approach is not to tell other people how to do their jobs: local workers know the idiosyncrasies of their systems better than a visitor ever can. Last Friday, with fetid water covering 80 percent of New Orleans, Mr. Black first met with representatives of the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board; of Entergy, the local electric and gas company; and of Atmos Energy, which supplies gas to parts of the city. They discussed where portable generators might be placed -- a tricky business, since they must be very close to large natural-gas lines. But when members of the group took a helicopter tour on Saturday, they realized that the standard way of doing things would be very difficult; there simply was not enough dry land near gas lines to get power flowing in less than a week. In interviews here on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Black said members of the group came back from the flight with ''droopy faces.'' All of their options were unappealing. Since Hurricane Katrina cut its destructive swath through the South, the Corps of Engineers has come under attack for the levee breaches that sent water pouring into the city and for taking part in planning that left New Orleans vulnerable to powerful storms. But the corps is also an essential part of repairing the damage that Hurricane Katrina wreaked -- and there is no higher priority than getting the stations working again, because little else can move forward before the 30 billion gallons of water is drained from the city, said Col. Richard P. Wagenaar, the commander and district engineer for the New Orleans District of the corps. ''It's all about the water,'' he said. Mr. Black is part of the Army's 249th Prime Power Battalion, which has its headquarters in Fort Belvoir, Va., and provides electric power for military operations and assists the Corps of Engineers in providing disaster relief. He has traveled the world for the battalion, including 16 months in Iraq after the American-led invasion. New Orleans presents a different kind of challenge. Rebuilding the breached levees has been an enormous undertaking. Many pumps are still submerged and will need to be completely dried out before they can be restarted. Even pumps that stayed high and dry could not be started because there was no power to feed them. After the first flight on Saturday dashed their hopes for a simple solution, things seemed bleak. Until somebody -- Mr. Black does not recall who -- remembered seeing the stoplight. It was in Jefferson Parish, just west of New Orleans. What it meant was that a power substation called Southport might be putting out electricity. If so, the next question was whether power lines were still intact enough to link the power plant to the pumps. In a second flight, the engineers determined that they were. Last Saturday night, Shelby Grosz from Entergy ran a check on the substation and then called Mr. Black excitedly. ''It's hot!'' he said. Over the next two days, workers climbed into electrical towers, some reachable only by boat, to make repairs. By Labor Day they had stitched together a direct link from the substation to Pumping Station 6, in effect turning part of the power grid into a giant extension cord. Inside the pumping station, oily, rank water covered the floor a foot deep or more in many places. But the Rube Goldberg concatenation of power lines was complete by 10 p.m., and the lights came on. The supervisor, Renauldo Robertson, left the control room and splashed across the floor to the first of the biggest pumps, which have 3,000-horsepower motors. Mr. Black followed. ''There were wiggly things swimming in the water around our feet,'' he recalled with a laugh. Mr. Robertson started four pumps that night, though two developed problems and had to be shut down. Mr. Black returned to Baton Rouge, where the emergency operations center is based, and did not get to sleep until 3:30 a.m. Tuesday. That afternoon, the helicopter took him back to New Orleans, to a part of Interstate 610 just at the point that it dipped eerily into the floodwaters, and where air boats would take him to the pumping station. But the boats were in use, and so an Entergy employee gave him a ride in the bed of his pickup truck, making his way through the deserted streets of Jefferson Parish. Getting into the pumping station's control room, a lived-in place cooled with a fan and currently stocked with cots and the military packages of meals ready to eat, now involves walking on boards placed on a ladder laid flat between staircases down to a walkway that is inundated. ''Don't fall in the water,'' Mr. Robertson warned, though the smell is warning enough. In the cavernous pump room, some of the machines date back more than 60 years, elegant pumps with a bold, futuristic beauty that recalls a time when industrial design and art were one. Mr. Black and Mr. Robertson have developed a quick friendship. But while Mr. Black is a technophile and a tinkerer, Mr. Robertson blends technology with intuition. When a worker came in to tell him one of the motors was running hot, he ordered him to go back and test the temperature, literally by hand. ''Put your hand on it and count to 5,'' he said. ''If you can hold it that long, it's fine.'' Mr. Robertson, 50, had ridden out the storm in Pumping Station 1, which is downtown. ''It was ugly,'' he said; the water poured in, and he and the rest of the crew had to climb 30 feet to the plant's narrow catwalks for safety, where they spent the first sleepless night in the heat and the dark, their arms hooked over the railings so they would not fall into the swirling waters. ''I've never been in a situation where I felt I wouldn't live to see tomorrow,'' he said. They were not rescued until last Wednesday morning. With his wife relocated to be with a daughter, in Ville Platte, Mr. Robertson went back to Plant 6. ''I really do miss them, but this is very important,'' he said. ''We're going to keep fighting, pumping this water -- I told my staff the biggest job in New Orleans is getting Station 6 pumping right now.'' ''You're kicking butt,'' Mr. Black told him. ''If we don't pump this water out, we lose this city,'' Mr. Robertson said. The work is a series of stops and starts, steps forward and back. Mr. Robertson had started three of the plant's smaller pumps along with the two largest; he took one of the two largest pumps out of service to address a leak in the gearbox, which needed to be refilled with lubricant. It had to be cleaned and dried. The motors to raise the sluice gates were not working, which meant that the water being pumped out had to escape from narrow openings around the gates. That, in turn, caused the motors to work harder than they should and overheat. On the spot, workers created a tool that would attach to a hand drillto turn the mechanism. At best, only 6 of the 15 pumps at Station 6 will be working in the near term, because the older ones do not operate on the standard 60-hertz current that flows through the nation's power grid. They require their own generator, which will not be working for some time to come. But it is something. On the high side of the canal, the water churned furiously. At night, the pumping station is a noisy, brilliantly lit outpost in the middle of a dark and silent ghost city. About 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Black left it and caught a ride to the New Orleans offices of the Corps of Engineers, where a late-night meeting was going on to discuss the issues still swirling around: the overall ''dewatering'' process; the need to get a diesel generator to a bridge across the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal so the bridge can be raised and allow equipment through on barges. Mr. Black, clearly exhausted, sat down to take part in the discussion. The meeting broke up well after midnight. Even when the pumping begins in earnest, there is a staggering amount of work to be done in New Orleans alone. Colonel Wagenaar discussed the fact that there is ugliness to come, as well. Debris is likely to crowd at the enormous intake tubes for the pumping plants, including human remains. Though gratings at the mouth of the intake pipes will prevent any bodies from being pulled into the works, that will inevitably add to the lingering horror of the hurricane that seems to never end. STORM AND CRISIS: PUMPING"
"The New Orleans Saints, whose season was thrown into chaos by Hurricane Katrina, will play their relocated home opener at Giants Stadium on Monday, Sept. 19, the N.F.L. announced Monday. The game will begin at 7:30 p.m. and be televised, with the Washington-Dallas game kicking off as scheduled at 9 p.m. The Saints-Giants game was originally scheduled to be played in New Orleans on Sept. 18 in what would have been the Saints' home opener, but the devastation caused by the hurricane has put the Saints on the road for the entire season. The team is training in San Antonio and does not know where the rest of its home games will be played, although it prefers to play at Louisiana State's Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge. The Jets have a home game at Giants Stadium on Sunday, Sept. 18, and the MetroStars have an M.L.S. game there on Saturday, Sept. 17. Saints Coach Jim Haslett was apparently annoyed that his team lost a home game from its schedule and was no happier that it was rescheduled for a Monday night. ''I really don't know why they're doing it,'' Haslett said while rolling his eyes, according to The Associated Press. The addition of what will be, in essence, an extra home game for the Giants does not please the other National Football Conference East teams, either. ''I'd be smart not to comment on that,'' Dallas Coach Bill Parcells said, according to The A.P. The Giants are expected to announce this week how tickets will be distributed. The Saints-Giants game will be shown on ABC until 9 p.m., then switched to ESPN in all markets except New York, Louisiana and other hurricane-affected areas. ABC will show the Washington-Dallas game at 9 p.m. While the Saints scrambled to restore some order to their season, Eli and Peyton Manning, the quarterbacks who grew up in New Orleans, accompanied a plane full of supplies to Baton Rouge on Saturday. Back with the Giants on Monday, Eli Manning spoke of what he had seen and heard. One man in a shelter told Manning that he heard a levee break at 3 or 4 in the morning, then the flood came, just two minutes later, filling the house and sending the man scurrying to his roof. His wife was still in the water, the man told Manning, and the man grasped for her. ''The next thing he knows, he's just holding her shirt; she's gone,'' Manning said Monday at Giants Stadium. ''He laid there for two days, just waiting to die, pretty much, and giving up. Finally someone came by and convinced him to get on a raft and saved him.'' Manning, the Giants' starting quarterback, had watched the horror in his hometown unfold on television last week. He compulsively looked for places close to his family's home in the Garden District; he recognized spots where he used to play as a child. The visit Saturday was as close as the Mannings could get to New Orleans, where they grew up. Their father, Archie, was a quarterback for the Saints. The enormity of the disaster was brought home in terrible detail during Manning's eight hours in Baton Rouge, in the difference he detected between the people who had been brought to the shelter with their families and those who still did not know where their children were. Manning's parents, Archie and Olivia, left town last Saturday and were staying in Oxford, Miss. Their home, they were told, was not flooded, although they do not know when they will be able to return. The images on television haunted Manning. ''You recognize areas,'' he said. ''St. Bernard, that whole area got hit real hard. Every Fourth of July, that's where I was playing baseball. It's hard to see places you recognize and people walking on the street with nothing.'' Manning will turn to more prosaic concerns Tuesday. He will have his first full practice since spraining his right elbow more than two weeks ago and will begin preparing for the Giants' season opener Sunday against Arizona. Manning threw 75 passes on Sunday to test his arm, and he said everything felt fine. So he and Coach Tom Coughlin are all but certain that he will start Sunday. ''He's excited and we are, too -- anxious to get going, really,'' Coughlin said. ''I think he has put himself in a position where he feels real good about where he's at.'' The throwing session was a relief for Manning, giving him one less thing to worry about. ''That's important for everything, not to be hesitant,'' he said. '''Is this one going to hurt? Can I make this throw?' I'll be confident I won't have to worry about my arm.'' Manning has begun the process of returning his focus to football. In the last few days, he said, he has tried to turn off the television, steering clear of the nonstop news coverage from New Orleans. He has had some relief because he knows his family is safe. ''You hear, 'Are they going to rebuild?''' Manning said. ''I would hope they will rebuild it. I think it's an unbelievable city. It's going to take time. It's going to take more time than people realize, with what damage has been done to New Orleans.'' PRO FOOTBALL"

Jeff Sandoz, dressed in black SWAT team fatigues with an assault shotgun nearby, took a break on Monday afternoon for a cheeseburger, his first hot meal in a week, in the breezeway at the shuttered Harrah's casino on the edge of the French Quarter. Rescuing people from rooftops and attics and chasing looters since Hurricane Katrina flooded the city, the discomforts have piled up, Sergeant Sandoz acknowledged. His shoulder was bruised on Wednesday when his police cruiser was rammed by someone running a stop sign on one of New Orleans's nearly deserted streets. He has been catching about three hours of sleep a night, curled up in the back seat of his patrol car, and showering with a garden hose. He did not want to talk about the blisters or funguses and rashes that have erupted -- after days of wading in polluted water in wet boots and dirty socks -- on the feet of most everyone in the eight-man tactical unit he commands. The last week has been a series of nonstop rescue missions, shootouts in the night and forays into foul-smelling shelters in response to gunshots and reports of rape for Sergeant Sandoz and the others on the New Orleans police force. And like most everyone else in New Orleans, police officers have been traumatized by the loss of homes and family members. Morale on the police force is in tatters. About 500 officers -- a third of the force and far more than previously estimated -- have dropped out of the daily lineup. Some of them may still be in houses cut off by the storm or may have simply gone off to help their families and will eventually return. But most of the missing officers have either told their superiors that they were quitting or simply walked off the job. Two officers have shot themselves to death. Sergeant Sandoz and his urban commandos, one of the city's toughest, most elite units, have absorbed much of the violence in stride. Unlike some other officers who have succumbed to the pressure, the sergeant said he was not going anywhere except into the streets to do his job. ''You just suck it up and drive on,'' he said. ''I'll be here as long as they need me. I'm not running away from anything.'' Still, he reserved judgment, as did many others, of the officers who have abandoned the force or collapsed. Sergeant Sandoz and his commandos have been tested by the long hours and the nagging inconveniences, like shortages of gasoline for their cars and other supplies. They expressed concerns, like many others, about the security of their jobs in a city that is taking steps to shut down for repairs. They wonder whether they will be paid for the overtime that they are logging under near-battlefield conditions. Trying to lift spirits, the Police Department is giving every officer a five-day vacation over the next two weeks as the military steps in to replace them. Those who want to go to Las Vegas are being given plane tickets and hotel rooms for them and their families. Their breaks are beginning with physical examinations in Baton Rouge, the state capital, 75 miles north of New Orleans, inoculations against water-borne disease and other necessary medical treatment. After their breaks, the officers will start receiving psychological counseling. Many officers said Monday that they are grateful for the breather but that they had no interest in going to Las Vegas. ''There's nothing in Las Vegas for me,'' said Officer Darryl Scheuermann, 41, a SWAT team member. ''I'm going to see my family. I miss my wife and my dogs.'' In one week, some officers have seen more violence than in a lifetime. Officer Brian French ducked sniper bullets while ferrying 50 women and children to a shelter in a commandeered rental truck. Lt. Julie Wilson watched a fellow officer and friend being shot by looters attacking a convenience store. Lt. Billy Ceravalo and Lt. Brian Weiss lost their police station in the flooding. The floodwater also swamped a nearby hospital. Responding to a call for help, the officers raced to the hospital and began helping patients using hand operated breathing devices. They managed to keep several critically ill patients alive for hours until help arrived. Some officers stayed in their homes as the hurricane swept over New Orleans and were forced to climb onto roofs with their families as floodwaters rose. Their pleas for help poured in over emergency radios. ''We were hearing officers on the roofs of their houses begging for someone to help them,'' Lieutenant Wilson said. One officer, she said, ''told me he was trapped in water up to his chest.'' ''I tried to get somebody out to him,'' she continued, but ''we haven't heard from him since. I don't know if he is alive or dead.'' Lieutenant Wilson's 11-year-old son, Daniel, was shipped off to neighbors. But for most of the week she had no idea where he was and worried that he feared for her as well. Now, the promise of a vacation in Las Vegas does not make her feel better. ''It's a really nice gesture,'' she said. ''But I just want to be able to get one night's sleep without hearing helicopters. I don't think I need five days off from this, just a couple of nights.'' Officer French, 25, a native of Ohio, joined the New Orleans Police Department because he wanted a chance to do ''real police work.'' Although he has heard city and state officials criticize the federal government as not coming fast enough, Officer French also questioned why local officers were not mustered sooner for special duty. ''They told us not to come in on Sunday, the day of the storm, to come in the next day to save money on their budget,'' he said. But he never made it to work on Monday, at least not to the station house. Officer French moved his family into a hotel. The hotel flooded, and looters attacked a nearby gasoline station. He went out into the storm, grabbed two of the looters and handcuffed them to a railing at the hotel. But, he eventually let them go. He kept his family in the hotel for several days. But they began running out of water, and one evening shooting broke out. For several days, Officer French rescued survivors from flooded homes. One he saved was Officer Willie Gaunt, who has since resigned. The city's police superintendent, P. Edwin Compass III, hustled to position boats and cars before the hurricane and afterward directed rescues and charged after looters. ''We had no food,'' Mr. Compass told reporters on Monday. ''We had no water. We ran out of ammunition. We had no vehicles. We were fighting in waist-deep water.'' Mr. Compass has been accused of poorly planning for the hurricane. But he and other city officials said they were simply overwhelmed by a crisis that no municipality could handle. The disaster was compounded, they said, when federal officials in Washington ignored their cries for help for several days. Immediately after the hurricane, he said, ''we had to use so much of our manpower to fight'' criminals that some rescues were delayed. On Monday afternoon at Harrah's casino, as armored cars, fuel trucks, police cars and ambulances covered the casino's ramp and spilled into the street, Officer Russell Philibert, 38, turned to Sergeant Sandoz's unit for help. He needed a bulletproof vest. His was lost when he escaped in shorts and sneakers as water gushed into his house. Shortly before he fled his house, he had received a radio message from another officer who lived nearby and was trapped in his attic by floodwaters in the middle of the storm. With the wind howling, he broke a window in that officer's house and dragged him to safety. Officer Philibert said his unit had now taken shelter in a Wal-Mart. The SWAT team has moved into an elementary school on high ground, where some officers can sleep on cafeteria tables and kindergarteners' nap pads. Even the urban commandos acknowledged the strain of what they had seen. ''I might have trouble sleeping, thinking about all the horrific stuff,'' said Officer Robert Haar, 35. ''But I'm so exhausted I just pass out.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE POLICE Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"Like so many other people here, Pedro, a landscaper from Chiapas, Mexico, is desperately trying to get out of Biloxi. He wants to take his wife, Anna, who is eight months pregnant, someplace cleaner and safer, wherever that might be. But aside from being low on gas like everyone else, Pedro, who would not give his last name because he is undocumented, is nervous about traveling in a city swarming with police officers and National Guard troops. Bran Dize, a prep cook from Spanish Town, Jamaica, near Kingston, worries that Hurricane Katrina may suddenly have made him an illegal immigrant because, he said, his guest worker visa requires him to work at a casino -- the Beau Rivage -- that, for all practical purposes, no longer exists. Hurricane Katrina has left its victims feeling vulnerable and uncertain, but for many noncitizens trapped here, the anxiety is especially acute because they worry that they will jeopardize their legal status if they try to leave. There are worries, too, about those who may not have survived the storm. The Mexican government has opened two mobile consulates in the affected areas, one in Mobile, Ala., and the other in Baton Rouge, La., to begin looking for tens of thousands of their citizens reported missing. The authorities in Mexico estimated that 145,000 Mexicans live in the area. At a tense meeting on Friday with immigration officials from the Jamaican government, a group of about 40 Jamaican guest workers from the Grand Casino, the Beau Rivage and the Casino Magic fired a battery of tough questions. ''Will we get paid for the remaining three months left in our contracts?'' one woman asked from the back of the crowd gathered at the Fairview apartments here. ''We don't have plane tickets back to Jamaica,'' another said. ''Who will pay for these?'' Solid answers were in short supply. ''I'm looking into this right now, but you have to be patient,'' said Barbara Dacosia, who oversees the 950 or so Jamaicans who work in casinos along the Gulf Coast in a nine-month guest worker program. ''We're going to do some practical things, and we're going to do some tropical things, and that means we're going to pray.'' Much like these immigrants, the city of Biloxi, defined over the past century by its transient culture of summer vacationers, sailors and gamblers, is at a standstill. Boats have been washed ashore. The number of visitors has dropped to zero from 10 million a year. The floating casinos have sunk. And movement is difficult. ''We tried to get gas, but when we got to the counter with our container, the man waved his hand and said no,'' Pedro, the Mexican landscaper, said in Spanish. ''We couldn't say anything because we thought he might get mad and call the police.'' José, also a Chiapas native who did not want to give his last name because he is undocumented, said that the only people he knew outside of Biloxi lived in Denver. But aside from having less than $20 left, he said he was also unsure whether he could make it that far without getting caught by the immigration authorities. Like the many immigrants who came to the area as cheap labor to help rebuild Biloxi after Hurricane Ivan, José arrived in the area in September 2004 looking for contract work. ''If I get a chance to get out of here, I'm going,'' he said. ''This is all I know.'' Ian Nelson, a Jamaican guest worker who for the last six months had been a housekeeper for the Grand Casino, said he would also rather not stay in the country. But as the only source of income for his parents in Jamaica, Mr. Nelson said he hoped the casino would find work for him in another state. ''I doubt they are going to help us,'' he said, ''because no one from the company has even checked to see if their workers who are stranded here are O.K.'' About 344 Jamaican guest workers were in Biloxi, based at the three casinos in the city, said Ms. Dacosia, the chief liaison for the Jamaican Central Labor Organization. It is not clear whether they will be returned home without pay or placed in other jobs, she said. Mr. Nelson said he had never felt more trapped in his life. ''I have come and gone under the work program for the past four years and never had troubles with the program,'' he said. ''But I paid for my own plane ticket and now I am here and I don't know if I will get the work and money that I was promised.'' STORM AND CRISIS: IMMIGRANTS"
"Jazmyn Anderson yawned and flexed her tiny, rail-thin arms. Weighing 1 pound 41/2 ounces, she is one of the tiniest and frailest of Hurricane Katrina's survivors, airlifted here to Woman's Hospital of Baton Rouge last week from a New Orleans hospital as part of a chaotic evacuation of newborns. The hospital was the clearinghouse for 121 babies rescued from hospitals in Orleans and Jefferson Parishes last week. Nearly all of the babies were newborns and most, like Jazmyn, were premature. Many have since been discharged or transferred elsewhere, but 37 remained at Woman's Hospital on Monday afternoon, most of them in a neonatal intensive care unit that hummed with the sound of ventilators and cardiac and respiratory monitors. The unit usually has about 60 premature babies at any one time; on Monday, doctors and nurses were caring for 95 babies. As of Monday afternoon, the hospital had not established contact with parents of about 10 of the 37 infants, but officials said they were hopeful that all of the babies would eventually be reunited with their families. Jazmyn Anderson was born 11 weeks premature on Aug. 27 at University Hospital in New Orleans, two days before the hurricane hit. She arrived here on Aug. 30; her mother is at a shelter nearby. She is so tiny her head fits into the palm of a nurse's hand. Inside an incubator, she breathed on her own, but an intravenous tube that delivered nutrients was attached to her belly button. Dr. Steven B. Spedale, the chief neonatologist at Woman's Hospital, said that he felt grateful for the chance to look after the babies but that the evacuation had not gone smoothly. ''The biggest frustration I've had is getting the babies here,'' Dr. Spedale said. ''When the levees broke, hospitals that thought they had weathered the hurricane suddenly had to deal with flooding, and the evacuations had to kick in. That's what really triggered the onslaught of patients.'' University Hospital in New Orleans, part of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, ended up having the largest number of babies that required evacuation, but it took more than a day to determine that because of disorganization and the lack of telephone and electrical service, Dr. Spedale said. The State Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness had designated Woman's Hospital to coordinate the evacuation of infants, and the State Department of Health and Hospitals had authorized Dr. Spedale to get whatever resources he required. Even so, the employees of Woman's Hospital had to navigate a maze of bureaucracy, contacting the State Wildlife and Fisheries Department, the Louisiana National Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers to secure transportation for the infants. In a series of telephone calls with Dr. Spedale, Dr. Brian Barkemeyer, the chief neonatologist at University Hospital, described the conditions. ''He had no electricity, no ability to do laboratory work, no ability to do X-rays, which is very important for premature babies because we have to verify that IV catheters and endotracheal tubes are placed correctly,'' Dr. Spedale said. The episode ended midmorning on Thursday, when Dr. Barkemeyer told Dr. Spedale that two helicopters had arrived but that he was not sure whether the Coast Guard, the Army or a private ambulance agency had sent them. He could say only that they were ''big green helicopters,'' so Dr. Spedale assumed they were from the Army. ''The military was evacuating all patients to the airport and there adult patients were getting triaged and placed on military transport planes and getting flown out,'' Dr. Spedale said. ''We did not want that to happen to the babies because they would not have been equipped at the airport to care for them.'' The 29 babies evacuated from University Hospital were taken to Woman's Hospital by helicopter and ambulance. Despite the disorder, Dr. Spedale said he was not aware of any deaths of infants or pregnant women associated with the evacuations. ''We've had mothers who were evacuated deliver prematurely,'' he said, ''but we have not yet seen babies with infections related to the conditions the mothers were in.'' STORM AND CRISIS: HOSPITALS"
"The Bush administration has been stung by criticism of its handling of Hurricane Katrina by anguished Louisiana officials and by nervous Republicans from across the country, but it has one stalwart defender right in the heart of the devastated region -- Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi. From the earliest moments of the crisis, Mr. Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has praised President Bush and a federal response to the storm that even the president later called ''not acceptable.'' At one point last week, when Mr. Barbour's glowing assessment was challenged by an interviewer on CNN, he asked ''if this is an interview or an argument.'' Mr. Barbour's praise of the federal efforts has put him at odds with some other Mississippi officials who have bemoaned the slow response in their areas and has put him at risk of sounding like a Pollyanna to Mississippians still struggling in the storm's aftermath. But the strategy is unsurprising for a canny political strategist like Mr. Barbour -- a former political director in the Reagan White House, chairman of the Republican Party, and powerful Washington lobbyist -- who won the governorship two years ago by in part emphasizing the strength of his close ties to President Bush. While some officials here have found his statements jarring, others said they could pay off if Mr. Barbour is able to parlay his good relationship with the Bush administration into more federal aid for his state. And they noted that the political dynamic here is very different from what is happening next door in Louisiana, where Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, a Democrat, was outspokenly critical of the federal response to the storm, and soon found her administration openly sniping with the White House over who was to blame for the ensuing disaster and who should lead the recovery. So while the frostiness between the president and Ms. Blanco cast a shadow over his trip to Louisiana on Monday morning, warmth and good feelings were on display when he met in the afternoon with Mr. Barbour in Poplarville and told a crowd that ''we're here for the long term.'' As they met, the Navy and Marines set up camp in Biloxi. Mr. Barbour appeared on television programs on Sunday morning, spreading his message that the federal effort was going well in his state. He told ''Face the Nation'' on CBS that ''the federal government has been fabulous in our state'' and ''Meet the Press'' on NBC that ''the federal government has been good partners to us.'' Some local officials have described a far different response. Mayor Johnny L. DuPree of Hattiesburg, a Democrat, complained over the weekend to The Hattiesburg American that it had taken days for federal help to arrive. ''I started trying to get federal help in here on Monday, and six days after this town has struggled to get enough water and ice for its people, we finally hear from the feds,'' the newspaper quoted Mr. DuPree as saying. State Senator Gloria Chisholm Williamson, Democrat of Philadelphia, said she believed that the criticism by Louisiana officials was instrumental in having the federal government step up its response. ''When they started getting criticized,'' Ms. Williamson said, ''all of a sudden we got the troops coming in, which is what we needed to begin with. I'm sorry that Governor Barbour is such a loyalist to his Republican president that he appeared to be putting that before the concerns of the people.'' The storm and its aftermath will shape the legacy of Mr. Barbour, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2008. And they will pose a big challenge for the governor, a proponent of small government, as he confronts a catastrophe that will require a big government response, whether in rebuilding areas now in ruins, finding housing and schools for the thousands left homeless or filling the sizable gap in state revenues caused by the devastation of coastal casinos and wide swaths of farmland. Prof. Marty Wiseman, the director of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University, said he would give Mr. Barbour generally high marks for his response so far. But Professor Wiseman said some Mississippians were questioning the governor's upbeat assessment of the federal response. ''That's the one eyebrow-raising factor that I've heard people mention,'' Professor Wiseman said. ''You've got to wonder if Haley's not trying to keep the table set for future cooperation.'' Mr. Barbour said his praise of the federal government was not a political calculation. ''I get all these questions all the time about, you know, there's not enough water in X or there's not enough ice in Y, and almost always there is something to that,'' Mr. Barbour said at a news conference here on Monday. ''But that's why you've just got to manage this deal and keep trying to wrestle this bear down to the ground, and that's what we're doing. ''The federal government, most all the time, has been first to say, 'We want to get you, we're pushing this toward you.' Have there been times where we didn't get as much as we wanted of this or that? Yes, sir. There have been. But, boy, it's been overwhelming, the millions of M.R.E.'s, ice, water that we've received.'' Mr. Barbour added: ''We haven't looked at it as, I'm going to be whiny, and I'll get more, or, I'm going to act like Tarzan, and I'll get more. We've been saying, what do you need to do to get the job done?'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR"
"After the wind, after the flood, after countless bodies are fished from muddy bayous or lifted off street corners or carried down from roofs or attics, the road ends here. At a warehouse next to the modest city hall in this ragged town just past where the sprawl of Baton Rouge gives way to farmland, refrigerated trucks on Sunday began the task of bringing what is expected to be thousands of bodies to the temporary mortuary set up to process victims of Hurricane Katrina. All day long on Monday, trucks bearing equipment and supplies and sometimes victims clattered down the narrow street just over the railroad tracks to what is called the Disaster Portable Mortuary Unit. There a staff of 100 workers -- morticians, forensic pathologists, anthropologists, medical examiners, coroners, fingerprint technicians, radiologists, dental technicians and others -- will identify bodies and prepare them for burial. No one knows how long it will take or how many bodies to expect. Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans warned on the NBC program ''Today'' that ''it wouldn't be unreasonable to have 10,000'' dead in the city. Capt. Marlon Defillo, spokesman for the New Orleans police, said city officials did not expect to have even a rough estimate of the number of dead until the end of this week. By then recovery teams will have conducted block-by-block searches of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern part of the city, he said. ''It's not going to be low,'' Captain Defillo said. So far only 23 bodies have been brought to the mortuary, and the official death toll for Louisiana stands at 71. Officials said the low count was due mostly to the arduous recovery process and the desire for accuracy. But some also said there was no way to make any kind of reliable projection, so the estimate of 10,000 deaths could turn out to be way off base. Whatever the number, nearly all bodies will come here, where officials say they are committed to what seems an almost impossibly contradictory mission -- handling with dispatch the victims in a death toll that could rival that of any natural disaster in American history and treating each body with the knowledge that it was someone's father, someone's mother, someone's child. ''Our goal is to do everything we can under the circumstances to treat each body with as much dignity and respect as we possibly can,'' said Bob Johannessen, a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, which is managing the mortuary operation with the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''We're trying to treat them all as individuals.'' Mobile units in New Orleans began collecting bodies from streets and flooded areas on Monday and going house to house in some neighborhoods to look for the dead. Until now, bodies had been left to rot in the streets while rescuers focused on searching for survivors. Some corpses were tied to road signs and electricity poles so they would not float away, but many have decomposed beyond recognition. Mr. Johannessen said bodies would first be taken to collection sites where preliminary information would be gathered to help identify them, including where they were found and any documentation or personal effects found with them. They will then be put in body bags, loaded onto refrigerated trucks and sent to this town of 5,300 just south of Baton Rouge, home to two prisons. The mortuary facility is about the size of football field and had been used by businesses to store merchandise. It can process about 140 bodies a day and is set up to accommodate 1,000 bodies, but it can be upgraded to handle ''in excess of 5,000,'' Mr. Johannessen said. He said he expected that the facility would be able to handle whatever need arose. Mr. Johannessen said bodies taken to the center, many of which have been decomposing in toxic water for a week, would first be decontaminated so they can be handled safely. Then officials will begin gathering forensic data, including dental X-rays, photographs, fingerprints and DNA samples, in an effort to identify bodies. Medical records, including information like pacemaker serial numbers or evidence of artificial hips or knees, will be compiled into a profile of each victim and stored in a database made accessible to families looking for missing people. Relatives will not be allowed to visit the bodies at the mortuary, Mr. Johannessen said. The state is looking for burial space, and victims not immediately identified will be buried there. Officials said families could later move bodies to family plots. Local residents, who were not told about the facility in advance, had mixed reactions to its presence. Chief Keith Ambeau of the police department acknowledged that some residents had expressed fears about health, odors and the stigma of a giant mortuary operating, perhaps for months, next to a residential area. ''It's human nature to have some concerns about bringing in dead bodies,'' Chief Ambeau said. ''People are going to worry about disease, contamination. But I've been saying all morning, my office is right here. I'm not going to put myself in danger. I think for the most part people are compassionate here. Their hearts go out to those people. New Orleans is only 75 miles away. Those are our brothers, our sisters, our loved ones.'' But at a house just a few hundred yards from the mortuary, three residents shuddered at the thought, with one woman expressing concerns about safety and property values. And echoing the issues of class and race brought up by the tragedy, she asked why it was put in her neighborhood, its residents largely, but not entirely, black and lower income. The per capita income in the town is $8,952, compared with $16,912 for the state and $21,587 for the nation. ''You look around this neighborhood for yourself,'' said the woman, who is black and did not want to be identified. ''You look at what color lives here. What their economic situation is. There's plenty of empty land in Louisiana. Why put it here?'' A few houses closer to the site, Paula Chong, who has two grown children and lives with a baby granddaughter, said she would prefer the mortuary to be elsewhere but believed it would be safe. ''We just need to turn to God,'' Ms. Chong said. ''All I ask is that they be careful and do everything in accordance with the law.'' Besides, she said, in the extended family that is south Louisiana, it is a facility that she may need, too. Counting her missing cousins, Ms. Chong said: ''I've got, what, 4, 5, 9 or 10 still missing? Lots of my cousins. So why would I complain when I still have family of my own missing?'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE DEAD Correction: September 8, 2005, Thursday A front-page article on Tuesday about a mortuary set up in St. Gabriel, La., for victims of Hurricane Katrina referred incorrectly in some copies to the only long-term treatment facility for Hansen's disease, or leprosy, in the continental United States. It is in Baton Rouge, not St. Gabriel."
"As a Navy helicopter flew over her house on Monday morning, Garnette Williams yelled, ''Come down, come down,'' but her voice was drowned by the chop of rotor blades. Ms. Williams, 42, her boyfriend, Carl Lewis, 52, and a family friend, Nick West, 51, decided it was finally time to leave, a week after Hurricane Katrina devastated this city. They stopped anyone they could find on the deserted Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard, in the Uptown area, to signal that they wanted out. ''We tried to stick it out, but now we've got no food, no water,'' said Mr. West, who is self-employed. ''We're starting to rot.'' While engineers began to pump water from New Orleans, the nearly abandoned city continued to empty Monday. The National Guard, the New Orleans police and other law enforcement officials began scouting door to door, encouraging the remaining people to leave but not yet ordering them to do so. By afternoon, some 1,150 people had been evacuated in the previous 24 hours, compared with 3,000 the day before, according to the Louisiana National Guard. Col. Terry Ebbert, director of the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security, said in an interview on Sunday night that he believed that fewer than 1,000 law-abiding citizens remained and that he hoped the city could essentially be emptied by Tuesday. But the New Orleans police said Monday that about 10,000 people remained in the city. W.J. Riley, the assistant superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, said Monday that there were about 4,000 National Guard troops, regular Army soldiers and police officers and sheriffs from around Louisiana and elsewhere in the country on the city's streets. Mr. Riley described the central business district as being ''locked down.'' Soldiers and police officers have taken up positions on street corners, he said, and police cars and military vehicles are cruising the streets. On Monday morning, Lt. Key McGuire of the Cochran, Ga., Police Department, stopped to offer water and medicine to the three stranded on Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard. Then National Guard troops from Oklahoma arrived and pointed toward a checkpoint where Ms. Williams, Mr. Lewis and Mr. West could catch a ride to the Convention Center for evacuation. They grabbed a couple of bags and began walking down the litter-filled street. Before they left, Ronnie Johnson, 37, rode by on a bicycle and asked for baby formula for his son, Ronnie Jr., who was born Aug. 27, two days before the hurricane hit. A flooded car and a tangle of mishaps had kept the family in town, but Mr. Johnson thought the need to leave their home on Josephine Street was getting urgent. ''All our food has maggots,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''It's unsanitary. I told my wife to go on ahead while I checked on my brother. But she's afraid we'll get separated and I won't see her for five or six months.'' Sgt. Dan Anderson of the New Orleans police said he was seeking to evacuate the elderly and the trapped and also looking to scavenge tires from a large Dodge truck. The department needed gasoline and tires, he said, explaining, ''We're getting a lot of flats.'' Norman Carter, 36, a contractor who spoke with Sergeant Anderson on an Uptown street, said he was reluctant to leave for fear that his family's home would be looted. ''My dad told me to stay and watch the house,'' Mr. Carter said. ''That's the bottom line. I'm not leaving until they assure me everyone is out of New Orleans and my parents' home will be safe.'' More than 400 troops from the Oklahoma National Guard began to fan out through a sector of about three miles by two miles that included the Garden District, to help willing residents leave. Fifty-six people were helped from a parking garage near St. Charles and Josephine on Sunday night, while another 85 gathered for evacuation at St. Charles and Napoleon, according to Maj. David Parker, executive officer of the First Battalion of the 279th Infantry of the Oklahoma National Guard. Residents were being allowed to take their pets, Major Parker said, because the authorities did not want the city to fill with roaming packs of abandoned dogs. ''They are going to get mean and hungry,'' Major Parker said. A more difficult task will come later, he said, when rescue of the living changes to a search for the dead and mandatory evacuations begin. ''We'll get guidelines on whether to use sheer force or coercion of some kind,'' he said, adding that the guardsmen would be aware that residents had suffered a devastating interruption in their lives. Several bodies could still be seen lying in or near Uptown streets. The authorities have said their primary mission is to rescue the living and that they do not yet have enough morgue space to begin collecting the dead. At least one woman, Elvira Smith, 65, known as Vera, was given an improvised burial on Saturday after she was killed on Tuesday by a hit-and-run driver, according to her companion, Max Keene. ''Here Lies Vera, God Help Us,'' said a spray-painted tarp covering an above-ground crypt made of paving stones at the corner of Jackson Avenue and Magazine Street. A neighbor, Patrick McCarthy, and a stranger, John Lee, helped bury Ms. Smith, and several people gathered Saturday for an impromptu prayer service. Ms. Smith was a kind-hearted woman who loved dogs, ''big wigs and shopped too much,'' Mr. McCarthy, 57, a retired air-conditioning and refrigerator mechanic, said Monday. The bodies left on the streets were emblematic of the hurricane relief effort, Mr. McCarthy said angrily, adding, ''If you need a metaphor of failure, this is as good as any.'' At least one bar in the French Quarter, Johnny White's Sports Bar and Grill, was open for business on Monday. A customer there, James LaLande, said he planned to stay unless he was forced to evacuate. He said that much of the last week had been terrifying, especially at night when abandoned dogs howled for food and water. ''All night you hear dogs barking,'' he said. ''It keeps you awake because it breaks your heart.'' Near the intersection of St. Charles and Napoleon, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sought to rescue about 150 pets left behind during the evacuation of Memorial Hospital. Three people and their dogs were also rescued from the hospital parking garage, police said. In the same area, a woman in her 90's reluctantly agreed to leave her home, whose first floor was flooded, but grew upset because police officers did not shut a second-story window after they rescued her. ''Her first floor was gone and she was worried about rain getting in the second story,'' said Capt. Eddie Hosli of the New Orleans police. ''Her whole life was in there. That's what makes it so sad.'' STORM AND CRISIS: CITY SEARCH"
"As criticism raged over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush returned to the region yesterday, and Army engineers patched up two levees that had been breached by the storm and cautiously began pumping water out of New Orleans. Mr. Bush comforted victims in Poplarville, Miss., and Baton Rouge, La., but he found himself ensnared in a dispute with Louisiana's Democratic governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who learned of Mr. Bush's trip from news reports. ''There's a lot of work to be done,'' Mr. Bush told a group of mostly black victims at a makeshift shelter, the Bethany World Prayer Center, in Baton Rouge. He said that Americans' response to the disaster had been ''amazing'' and that ''this country is going to be committed to doing what it takes to help people get back on their feet.'' The president's trip, an effort to calm the region and part of a major White House campaign to stem the political damage from the hurricane, came as rescue teams in New Orleans searched for thousands of residents who remained in the city, many having ignored pleas to evacuate. The city's No.2 police official, W.J. Riley, said his officers were trying to convince people that staying behind was pointless because ''this city has been destroyed, completely destroyed.'' As has been true for days, the death toll was assumed to be disastrously high, but estimates remained little more than guesses -- perhaps educated, perhaps not. Officially, the Louisiana toll climbed to 71. The mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, said the figure might well reach 10,000. But there was some positive news yesterday. Army engineers said that after having dumped hundreds of bags filled with cement, sand and pieces of ruined roadways, they had closed the breach in the levee at the London Avenue Canal. Late yesterday afternoon, state officials said that another crucial levee, on the 17th Street Canal, had also been patched up. With those barriers at least temporarily restored, engineers began draining the flooded streets and sending the water back into Lake Pontchartrain, but carefully, using portable pumps set up at near the lake on the 17th Street canal. Gregory E. Breerwood, a city engineer, said, ''We intend to take it slowly so we don't overtax the pumps themselves, because they have not been in service for a while.'' West of the city, in Metairie, residents were permitted to return, if only for a day, to salvage what they could from their flooded houses. In Baton Rouge, Governor Blanco greeted Mr. Bush as he arrived, but only after her press secretary called to alert her at 6 a.m. as she waited on a plane to take off from Baton Rouge for Houston. The press secretary, Denise Bottcher, said in an interview that she had first learned that Mr. Bush would be in Baton Rouge from news reports late Sunday and early yesterday, even though CNN had been reporting the president's trip to an unspecified location in Louisiana as early as Saturday. ''We're so busy, I can't sit down to watch TV,'' Ms. Bottcher said, adding. ''Why should I get that news from CNN?'' Ms. Bottcher said she then called the White House yesterday morning, ''and they extended an invitation.'' Dana Perino, a White House spokeswoman, said the White House reached out to Ms. Blanco's office on Sunday and made contact with her yesterday morning. Ms. Blanco and Mr. Bush have been at odds over the deployment of the National Guard in Louisiana, and both sides pointed fingers. On Friday night, Ms. Blanco refused to sign an agreement proposed by the White House to share control of National Guard forces in the state with federal authorities. ''She would lose control when she had been in control from the very beginning,'' Ms. Bottcher said on Sunday. The Times-Picayune, Louisiana's largest newspaper, published an open letter to Mr. Bush on Sunday that called for the firing of every official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''We're angry, Mr. President, and we'll be angry long after our beloved city and surrounding parishes have been pumped dry,'' said the newspaper, which endorsed Mr. Bush for president in 2000 but made no endorsement in 2004. At the Bethany World Prayer Center in Baton Rouge, the president's first stop of the day yesterday, some evacuees from the hurricane ran up to meet with Mr. Bush, but many hung back and looked on. One of them, Mildred Brown, who had been at the shelter since Tuesday, told The Associated Press: ''I'm not star-struck; I need answers. I'm not interested in hand-shaking. I'm not interested in photo ops. This is going to take a lot of money.'' One evacuee from New Orleans, Richard Landres, a lumberyard worker, was more positive about Mr. Bush. ''I think he's doing what he can do,'' Mr. Landres said, according to a White House pool report. Mr. Bush was flanked as he spoke by Mayor Kip Holden of Baton Rouge and T.D. Jakes, a conservative African-American television evangelist with a megachurch in Dallas who has been courted by the White House as a partner in reaching out to the black vote. ''I want to thank my friend T.D. Jakes for rallying the armies of compassion to help somebody like the mayor,'' Mr. Bush said. Later in Baton Rouge, Mr. Bush spoke for an hour and a half with Ms. Blanco and members of Louisiana's Congressional delegation in a meeting that Ms. Bottcher described as ''very positive'' and that other participants called blunt. The elected officials said Mr. Bush mostly listened. Representative Bobby Jindal, a Republican who represents New Orleans, said afterward that while the tone of the meeting was polite, ''there was a lot of frustration.'' ''It was not hostile,'' Mr. Jindal said. ''It was honest.'' The trip was Mr. Bush's third survey of the region in the past week. He was in New Orleans and Biloxi, Miss., on Friday, and he flew over the area in Air Force One as he returned from an extended vacation on Wednesday. Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush did not go to New Orleans yesterday because he had visited it on Friday. On that visit, however, he did not go to the Superdome or the convention center, where tens of thousands of largely poor and black victims had been desperate for food and water for days, and some older evacuees had died in their wheelchairs. Mr. Bush did speak at the New Orleans airport and visit the repair work under way at the 17th Street Canal, where he met with workers, some of whom had lost their homes. Mr. McClellan also said Mr. Bush steered clear of New Orleans yesterday because he did not want to disrupt continuing relief efforts. ''Today, he wanted to visit citizens of New Orleans who have been evacuated and are in need of continued assistance, as well as volunteers who are helping them,'' Mr. McClellan said in an e-mail message. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Bush spoke at a community college to residents of Poplarville, a small town about 40 miles inland that was badly hit by tornadoes accompanying the hurricane, then took a walking tour of a suburban street. Branches and trees littered the sides of roads, and electricity was still out, with water coming back slowly, but the damage was nothing like the destruction Mr. Bush saw on Friday in Biloxi. ''Out of this despair is going to come a vibrant coast,'' Mr. Bush told the crowd at the Pearl River Community College. ''I understand if you're saying to yourself, 'Well, it's hard for me to realize what George W. is saying because I've seen the rubble and I know what has happened to my neighbors.' But I'd like to come back down here in about two years and walk your streets and see how vital this part of the world is going to be.'' Some residents said Mr. Bush's visit to Poplarville had lifted their spirits. ''He said the worst was going to be over,'' said Dawn Stuit, 48, a real estate agent, who had spoken to the president on the street and said that he had kissed her cheek. She said she was feeling better yesterday because her electricity would be restored soon. ''I think the president visiting had something to do with the power coming back on,'' she said. Other residents viewed the president's visit with anger. ''If it takes them a week to figure out that people need food and water, maybe they need to step back and fire themselves,'' said Robert Duke, 43, waiting in a gas line in Poplarville. ''Some of them need to go to jail over this.'' In New Orleans, the city took a few slow steps on the arduous journey toward recovery. Power was even restored in some neighborhoods. Mayor Nagin, who had raged against the federal government days ago for what he called its slow response to the crisis, struck a more positive tone, despite his estimate of the large number of dead. ''We're making great progress now,'' he said on the ''Today'' program on NBC. ''The momentum has picked up. I'm starting to see some critical tasks being completed.'' After days of looting and reports of murders and rapes, the New Orleans police and military troops asserted control. ''We continue in lockdown,'' said Mr. Riley, assistant police superintendent. ''I feel the city is very secure,'' he said. ''Chaos is moving to being organized chaos. It's better now.'' A major issue, he said, is clearing the city of remaining residents to prepare for the cleanup. ''Our officers are telling people there's absolutely no reason to stay,'' Mr. Riley said. ''There are no homes to go to, there's no hotels.'' Social services officials in Louisiana said yesterday that about 114,000 people had taken refuge in shelters stretching from West Virginia to Utah. The largest number, 54,000, remained in Louisiana, but almost as many were in Texas. Officials also said that in the last three days they had received 90,000 applications for food stamps from hurricane victims. Typically, they said, they process 1,300 applications a day. Long-term problems facing people along the Gulf of Mexico were raised by former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. As in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, they were asked by President Bush to help raise money for evacuees. ''Recovery is going to take years,'' former President Bush said in Houston as he and Mr. Clinton announced the creation of a new fund. Mr. Clinton touched on the need to find jobs for people who had left their homes. ''One of the things we have to ask is: What could we do to give incentives for people to get jobs where they have to relocate,'' he said. ''A lot of these people will be out of their homes a year or more.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT"
"Before Hurricane Katrina, people around here took pride in living at what they called the end of the world: far from New Orleans in miles and in spirit, at the bottom of a narrow peninsula that juts into the Gulf of Mexico as if in dare. The only main road, Route 23, meandered past marinas and oil refineries, little shops and the occasional church, in small, distinct towns: Happy Jack and Sunrise, Buras and Boothville, and then pretty much just Venice, where people who worked long shifts -- seven days on, seven days off -- hopped helicopters to oil platforms somewhere out in the gulf. The local boast about being at the end of the world no longer smacks of hyperbole, now that the hurricane has wiped the smile off the face of Happy Jack and all its neighbors. These towns remain mostly submerged, deserted and dead quiet, though the destruction easily conjures a hurricane's furious howls. Few if any houses survived; those not still under water were flattened in place or thrown acres away. Hundreds of pleasure boats, fishing vessels and small ships were indiscriminately dry-docked, tossed onto embankments, into swamps, even onto the state highway. Oil refinery tanks crumpled into balls; bits and pieces of homes scattered like confetti; downed telephone wires snaked off into uselessness; and virtually no living thing was around, save for stranded livestock, crying seagulls and a few dogs looking for masters. There is no visible National Guard presence, no smaller version of the hectic recovery taking place farther north. This is partly because the hurricane essentially severed the area from the rest of Louisiana; the view by helicopter, the only way to get here other than by boat, shows impassable Route 23 submerged then dry, submerged then dry. Another reason, the law enforcement officials here say, is that two days before last Monday's hurricane, they went door-to-door, telling people it was time to go. Most people obliged, they say, fleeing to a high school in Belle Chasse, to a relative's home in Folsom, to safe places in Alabama and Mississippi. Residents here know that when it comes to hurricane season, defiance can be fatal. Now, sheriff's deputies from the local parish of Plaquemines are looking for people, alive or dead, on the levee banks and in the darkness of all those upturned boats. ''We still have people out here hiding from us,'' Deputy Sheriff Timmy Arceneaux said Monday. ''But when they get tired of no food and water, they'll be found.'' From the sky, it is hard to imagine anyone still living in Lower Plaquemines: amid the black, oil-slick waters lapping against the doors of the Family Dollar store or near the Buras water tower with steel legs buckled beneath it, or among those small yellow atolls -- the rooftops of school buses that will not be transporting children anytime soon. Setting ground in Venice only reinforces the twinned senses of devastation and isolation. The hurricane hit with such force that it dragged large fishing vessels across Route 23, scarring the pavement, and twisting two pumps in front of a gasoline station's skeleton into grotesque bows. Broken gas lines churn the water with bubbles. A few stacked sandbags suggest an aborted attempt at shoring up. The air reeks of diesel fuel and the sea and dead things. A few miles north, in the town of Empire, there was movement, human movement: sheriff's deputies from Plaquemines Parish, surveying the damage, chasing ghosts of people reluctant to leave and steeling themselves to look for the dead in those upturned boats. At that moment, they were marveling at the clump of boats, including two massive fishing vessels, the Sea Hawk and the Sea Falcon, now plopped smack in the center of Route 23. ''Someone was camping out here,'' Deputy Sheriff Arceneaux said, standing in the clump's large shadow. ''We found some beer and potato chips.'' He started walking north on a deserted stretch of Route 23 called the Empire Bridge, accompanied by his oil rigger of a son, Ryan, and Lt. Steve Zegura. They pointed out how the hurricane had twisted the bridge, bending it west toward the bay. They noticed this because the Lower Plaquemines area is, was, their home. Deputy Sheriff Arceneaux, a weathered 44, used to live in a trailer at the northern end of the bridge. It is destroyed, he said, along with the neighboring One-Stop convenience store. He pointed straight ahead, where the highway slid back again underwater. That green house in the middle of the submerged road is owned by his cousin, he said, and it used to be 200 yards to the east. He looked around at what had been his town and pointed out pieces of the community's jigsaw puzzle that had been moved and shoved to form a different puzzle altogether. The Delta Marina used to be east of Route 23, and now it was west. The severely damaged civic hall over there -- ''They had weddings and dances and all kinds of stuff'' -- used to be on Highway 11, only Highway 11 is now nowhere to be seen. ''And this,'' he said, nodding toward what looked like a lake, ''this was a trailer park.'' He stopped talking, and then there was no sound other than the howl of either a dog or a coyote. It served as a reminder that animals outnumbered humans here. Lieutenant Zegura, 44, squat, and wearing rubber boots that he called ''Cajun Reeboks,'' started talking. How he was born and raised with Timmy Arceneaux. How Timmy was with him when he was shot 10 years ago in Sunrise. How word had come to the Zegura family that the hurricane may have killed a nephew of his in Slidell. How an Empire man -- Charlie Martin, wasn't it? -- died; some Mexican fishermen found his body floating near their boat, and they laid it out on dry land. And how another local man survived the hurricane clinging hands and feet to a telephone pole. More silence on a highway without traffic, in a town without the hum of motorboats, the lazy buzz of Labor Day, the sound of children. Not to worry, the three local men said. Lower Plaquemines will rise again. ''Next year we'll be fishing,'' Lieutenant Zegura said. His lifelong friend, Timmy Arceneaux, agreed. ''Redfish,'' he said. ''Flounder. Speckled trout.'' Then again it got quiet. STORM AND CRISIS: LAND OF WATER"
"Their 4-year-old daughter, Laurel, had complained of missing only two things, Leslie and Jaime Mixon said, since the family evacuated their Louisiana home two days before the storm hit: a playmate and the contents of her dress-up chest, especially a Cinderella costume and a cardboard sword. The tow-headed little girl found both here this weekend at the home of Shannon O'Lear, her husband, Alex McKinney, and their own 4-year-old daughter, Hayes, who were offering shelter to one of the refugee families pouring into American cities and small towns in a diaspora that rivals any this nation has ever seen. The Mixons had come to this woodsy acreage, with its meandering creek and menagerie of cats, dogs and horses, to inspect a newly renovated two-bedroom basement apartment, with a separate entrance, that Ms. O'Lear and Mr. McKinney had posted online, one of thousands of impromptu invitations from families, primarily Southerners, for total strangers to live rent-free in their homes. Similar offers popped up last week on Internet sites like Craigslist and MoveOn.org, which reports that 142,522 refugees have been invited to strangers' homes. Neither the Red Cross nor the Federal Emergency Management Agency was willing to endorse the grass-roots effort or distribute the listings, fearing liability if guests turned out to be predatory or had medical or emotional problems unknown to their hosts. But generosity trumped caution. From a Memphis family came the warning that their household included an ''unpredictable'' teenage son but reassurance that there were plenty of retail jobs nearby. A family from Allen, Tex., told prospective guests that they were far from public transportation but could offer daily rides to the train. In Stone Mountain, Ga., a young couple who had made contact with a family of five said there would be no problem welcoming them even though they included an elderly woman with dementia and incontinence. The Mixons had expected to squeeze in with relatives who had a pair of tiny houses in this town outside Atlanta, and they agonized over whether to accept the hospitality of Mr. McKinney and Ms. O'Lear ''when so many people are worse off.'' But within moments of the Mixons' arrival, Laurel and Hayes were fast friends, playing dress-up, jumping rope and, curled up in the same overstuffed chair, watching cartoons. Ms. O'Lear even offered to home-school Laurel, as she did Hayes, to allow the Mixons to avoid the search for a temporary prekindergarten. ''There's no turning this down, if only for Laurel,'' said Jaime Mixon, her hesitation quickly evaporating. Ms. O'Lear, 38, had ignored relatives and neighbors who told her she was taking a crazy risk in giving strangers an apartment she could rent for $800 a month. All she wanted in reassurance was a driver's license, establishing that a guest family indeed came from the flood zone. ''I don't think criminals drove all the way to Atlanta so they could rob us,'' she said, noting the sad reality that for the most part, only those who could afford cars had gotten out in time. ''Anyway, we've always done things against the grain.'' The Mixons, from Metairie, a New Orleans suburb, had been staying here with one of Mrs. Mixon's brothers, Steve Overmeir. Her elderly parents, Ruby and Fred, who had also fled Metairie, were living nearby with another brother, John, and his wife and daughter. Soon to arrive were the remaining three Mixon siblings: Kathy, along with her grown son, both currently boarding with nine other relatives in Chattanooga, Tenn., in a house where remnants of the storm had knocked out power; Ann, with her grown daughter and fiancé, crammed in with scores of friends and relatives in Eunice, La.; and Kerry, who is driving a camper down from her home in Washington to accommodate the overflow. Mrs. Mixon, the baby of the clan at 37, figured that if her family moved out of Steve's three-bedroom bungalow that he shared with a roommate, perhaps with Ann's daughter and fiancé in tow, her parents could move there and Ann, hobbled from recent back surgery, could take their place at John's single-story three-bedroom house, since she could not climb stairs. There were two ways to accomplish that: accept the offer of Ms. O'Lear and Mr. McKinney or live in Kerry's R.V. Mrs. Mixon considered and reconsidered. How could she ''in good conscience'' accept a free apartment with cable television, vases of freshly picked zinnias in every room and a kitchen stocked with coffee and grits when others were needier? She even had a house to go home to someday, or so it seemed from satellite photos on the Internet. That is not to say the Mixons had nothing to worry about. They have been granted a four-month grace period on their mortgage, but will owe the back payments in one lump sum by the first of the year. A duplex rental property is uninhabitable, leaving them with no income and another mortgage to pay. Mr. Mixon hopes his business, selling diving equipment to crews working the oil rigs, will survive; otherwise, he may have to return to offshore diving, the dangerous occupation he gave up when Laurel was born. Mrs. Mixon and her mother shared this information with Ms. O'Lear while others of the two families toured the apartment, complete but for a showerhead. The visitors admired the perennial garden and the family cars, powered by recycled cooking oil. Hayes and Laurel paraded in and out, dressed as a witch and a devil and then as ballerinas. Midway through the dance recital, Ms. O'Lear disappeared upstairs to take a telephone call from Assunta Jackson of New Orleans. A few days before, the Jackson family -- a middle-aged couple and their two grown children, two dogs with them -- had expressed interest in the apartment and had made an appointment to see it. But they had never shown up -- perhaps, Ms. O'Lear speculated, because they are African-American and leery of living with a white family here in Forsyth County, where it is ''unusual to see a black person.'' So Ms. O'Lear was thrilled to hear Mrs. Jackson's voice, but only for an instant. Mrs. Jackson explained that her father, left behind in a New Orleans veterans' hospital, had died there of dehydration. Her mother, by his side as he lay unattended, had been evacuated to a hospital in Arkansas, but Mrs. Jackson had no idea where. Overcome by grief and anger -- ''The government killed my daddy,'' she wailed -- Mrs. Jackson said she was headed home, hoping to bury her father and find her mother. Now it was Ms. O'Lear who was sobbing, clinging to her husband as the family of refugees swallowed her in their embrace. At 9 a.m., these families had been strangers. Had it not been for their children, they most likely would have stayed that way, parting company in an hour or two. Instead, it was midafternoon. Laurel and Hayes had abandoned ballet for karate. And another family, which none of them had ever met but all of them cried for, was bound for New Orleans, 600 miles away, on a tragic errand. There was no need to discuss details. In the next week or so, depending on whether they made a trip to Metairie to secure their home and gather possessions, the Mixons expected to move in. Laurel could watch a ''Brother Bear'' video with Hayes instead of scenes of destruction on television, and there were many costumes for the girls to share. Both families would gather at Steve Overmeir's house for a dinner of ''drunken salmon,'' grilled in a marinade of Crown Royal whiskey. It was time for the Mixons to pile back into their van and find a Red Cross office that might be issuing checks, a discount store for toiletries and a church of their liking. Laurel wept behind the tinted windows. Hayes waved. Both mothers reassured their children that they would see each other soon. ''This woman is awesome,'' Mrs. Mixon said as she hugged Ms. O'Lear like a sister. The praise brought fresh tears to Ms. O'Lear's eyes, but also a quick demurral. ''I'm just a person,'' she said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE DISPLACED"
"And so they found refuge here, beside the red brick walls of the Texas death house. Many called it heaven. With emergency shelters stretched tight from New Orleans to Houston, eight buses carrying more than 300 survivors of the flood ended up here in the proud ''prison city'' of Texas, 80 miles north of Houston, where every third or fourth resident lives behind bars, in seven prisons that confine 9,000 to 15,000 inmates. The First Baptist Church, which backs up on Huntsville's oldest prison unit, including the nation's busiest execution chamber, was ready with cots, showers, fresh clothes and hot food. And prison trusties in white uniforms to clean and cook. ''They're very thankful that we're here to help,'' said Shannon Smith, 33, who is serving 10 years for aggravated assault for beating his wife while he was a drug addict. Some evacuees said they felt blessed and had no fear of the inmates. ''We went to the Astrodome first and they didn't let us in -- thank you, Jesus,'' said Rose West, 67, who was rescued from a housing project but is missing members of her family. The setting might be unusual, but with thousands of makeshift accommodations being pressed into service across the state and country, hardly extraordinary. On Tuesday, several thousand evacuees are scheduled to be taken aboard cruise ships in Galveston and housed in relative luxury, although the swimming pools, spas and casinos, which require special staffing, will be closed, officials said. ''These folks will have food and a damn small room a block from downtown, and I'm sure they'd also like some work,'' said A.R. Schwartz, a former Democratic state senator from Galveston, who helped coordinate the use of the cruise ships, the Ecstasy and the Sensation of Carnival Cruise Lines. ''It might be time for a Roosevelt-style public works program.'' On the way to Galveston, they will pass through a palm-fringed district with ornate mansions that are some of the few structures to survive the Great Storm of 1900. Only the body count in New Orleans will determine whether Hurricane Katrina surpasses that storm, which killed 6,000 to 12,000 people, as the deadliest natural disaster in United States history. The numbers being officially housed in shelters are vastly overshadowed by those being put up by hotels, relatives and friends, churches and private organizations. About a quarter-million evacuees have ended up in Texas, officials have said, though some are already being flown to other states. It was hitting home, too, Mayor Bill White of Houston said. ''My in-laws -- my wife was born in Louisiana -- and they have a network of people here and all up and down the city, and they have folks in their house, and that's happening all over the place,'' Mr. White said. In Huntsville, 14 prison trusties helped the Red Cross and church volunteers. The trusties are minimum-security offenders allowed out under guard supervision to help with community projects. ''I have no problem with that,'' said Jaqulyn Francis, 49, robbed by the flood of her job serving food in the workers' cafeteria of the Hotel Intercontinental in New Orleans, as well as her home and everything she owned. ''It's a blessing for them to volunteer.'' Her grown son was missing, too. Mike Carlson, an investigator for the Walker County district attorney's office and a deacon at First Baptist, said he thought little of seeing offenders in the shelter. ''This is Huntsville,'' Mr. Carlson said. The trusties are forbidden to interact with the evacuees. With 70,000 male felons released every year steps from the church, pastors try to greet them all and offer help. The clergy also ministers to the families of death row inmates. Many evacuees said they were overwhelmed by their welcome in Huntsville, starting when Pastor David Valentine boarded each of the arriving buses at 1 a.m. Friday to announce: ''I guess you've been in hell. Welcome to heaven.'' The pastor, who said the bus was reeking when it arrived, told his guests that Huntsville was ''the safest place you'll ever be.'' The journey was an ordeal, many said. Kathy Hunter, 44, said she walked across a Mississippi River bridge with her luggage to reach the Superdome and when she finally boarded a bus with her bags, was ordered off because it was too crowded. She was put on another bus, with her bags and wallet still on the first bus. She said she never saw her things again. ''Can you write this down?'' she asked. ''Kathy Hunter wants her son to contact her at the First Baptist Church in Huntsville.'' His name, she said, is Warren Bell. She said a stranger stopped her on the street in Huntsville the other day, asked whether she was from New Orleans and gave her $20. Latora Faggin, 28, with four boys ages 3 to 11, said that a police officer took her two older sons horseback riding and to a McDonald's and that an officer was taking them swimming on Monday afternoon. Other people said they had been taken to the hallowed Texas institution of a Friday night high school football game. Ms. Faggin said police officers in New Orleans told her she could not take her bag, which had all her money -- $48 and some quarters -- on the bus to Houston. The Astrodome was too crowded, she said, and they were diverted to a shelter in Conroe, north of the city. ''They were only able to take four more but there were 12 of us,'' she said, ''so they brought us here.'' Now, Ms. Faggin said, her family was so happy that they were determined to stay in Huntsville. ''That makes two of us,'' said Kevin Williams, 42, who overheard her. He said he had been separated from his wife, Evelyn, and 13-year-old daughter, Kachanda, at the Superdome when the women and children were evacuated first. ''She didn't want to leave me, but I said, 'baby, you go; wherever you go I'll find you.''' Mr. Williams said he left on a later bus that took them, with no food, to Dallas. There, he said, his luck changed. A stranger named Raul Gardner presented him and two companions with a paid-for Alamo rental car, which they drove to Houston. The other two dropped him off at the Reliant Center near the Astrodome where, he said, a volunteer named Steve found an Internet posting saying that his wife and daughter had been taken to Huntsville. Steve drove him there, and gave him $100. Mr. Williams found his family at the shelter. ''The people in Texas, their heart is as big as the Lone Star State,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: TEXAS Correction: September 9, 2005, Friday A picture caption in some copies on Tuesday with an article about hurricane victims who found refuge in Huntsville, Tex., referred incorrectly to the Rev. Melvin Macat, who was at a shelter at the Mount Zion Baptist Church. He is the church pastor, not a storm evacuee."
"As Hurricane Katrina hit this coastal town with its full fury, C.B. Hales Jr., the director of BellSouth's facilities in the region, received a plea from one of the managers riding out the storm with him: Come upstairs immediately, the brick wall protecting the main generator was giving way. Mr. Hales and eight colleagues, who had been hunkered down in the basement of the communications center, ran to the rooftop room. With winds of 130 miles an hour turning shingles, tin and wood into missiles, they furiously patched the wall with plastic tarps, plywood and a cardboard science project made by one worker's son. ''We grabbed what we could to protect the engine,'' Mr. Hales said, standing on the sun-baked roof several days later as workers stacked bricks and the generator roared. ''If that generator failed, we'd have been toast.'' With electricity out across much of the six counties in Mississippi that Mr. Hales' team covers, the generator now powers BellSouth's splintered telecommunications system in the coastal region. It keeps the computers, phones and other critical equipment at the central switching office here operating. While crucial, the generator is just one piece of the complex puzzle that BellSouth needs to solve before it can fully restore its communications network. It took three days for BellSouth, the main telecommunications company serving the storm-devastated region, to restore the crucial fiber lines that carry phone calls and data in and out of the area. Until then, Mr. Hales, his workers and residents nearby had little communication with the outside world. ''When we're not communicating, they're not communicating,'' said Roy Craig, an engineer who helped Mr. Hales save the generator. After the storm passed on Wednesday, 1.75 million BellSouth customers had either spotty service or none, the company said. Of that total, 750,000 were in the most damaged areas along the Mississippi coast and southern Louisiana, most of them without any access to communications. [As of Monday, about 650,000 customers out of that original group had service restored, leaving 1.1 million still suffering. Only about 120,000 of the 590,000 BellSouth customers in the six-county Gulf Coast District had working service, the company said.] The company said it expected repairs to take as much as six months in the most damaged areas. Over all, BellSouth expects to spend at least $600 million to repair its network and restore service across the affected states. But Jeff Batcher, a company spokesman, warned that the estimate was made ''without the opportunity to survey all the damage,'' suggesting the cost could rise further. Service in the coastal region is particularly spotty, in part because some of the fiber lines so carefully spliced together were severed again by the removal of fallen trees and the repairing of power lines. The generators powering communications equipment have been running out of fuel, and BellSouth, like so many other companies, has struggled to find more for its generators and its trucks. Company executives said that government officials even commandeered one of the company's tankers that was ferrying fuel to Mississippi. Then there are the logistics of coordinating BellSouth employees. Hundreds of employees are homeless; about 200 are still unaccounted for. The company has set up a tent city on the outskirts of Gulfport that dozens of employees and their families now call home. BellSouth has established five more like it -- three in Louisiana and two in Mississippi. Mr. Hales, whose home near the beach was destroyed, and several other managers are sleeping on air mattresses in their offices. Even those whose homes still function are waiting in endless lines to get gas so they can report to work. BellSouth, whose nine-state territory stretches from Florida in the east to Louisiana in the west and north to Kentucky, is no stranger to hurricanes. It has contingency plans and emergency response teams on standby. Many employees, including Mr. Hales, are veterans of hurricanes stretching back to Camille, which hit in 1969. But Katrina was the worst ever. The company has had to abandon many of its operations in New Orleans and the immediate area, probably for months. Conditions along the Mississippi coast, while ruinous, are at least tenable. The police kept potential looters at bay in the initial chaos and the streets have dried out, so essential work can be done. Hundreds of BellSouth two-worker teams have fanned out across the region to assess the damage. A couple of switching stations near the border with Louisiana were destroyed. Other offices are standing, but the equipment was ruined. Machines that have since dried are likely to corrode in the coming weeks because salt water washed through them. The damaged equipment pales besides other grim news workers are reporting. One team out to repair a damaged fiber optic cable came across six bodies. The extent of the damage to the company's aerial and buried lines is far from clear. Surveyors like Jay Murphy, a 36-year veteran, are going street by street to inspect poles, lines and switch boxes. Mr. Murphy and his partner, Ellen Stephens, stood on a Biloxi side street where the power company had removed the electricity transformer from a pole where phone and electric cables dangled. Mr. Murphy, whose own home was filled with mud -- ''It's like King Tut's tomb in there'' -- said a crew would have to restring a phone line 1,200 feet to the next service box. Not a hard task, he explained, but it cannot be done until ''every foot of Biloxi'' is examined to determine what needs to be fixed first. On a map rolled out on his pickup truck, Mr. Murphy had traced red ink along the handful of streets he and Ms. Stephens covered that day. By his estimate, only one-eighth of the city had been inspected. Managers are only just collating information about the extent of the damage to the company's network. Teams in districts from Mobile, Ala., in the east to Baton Rouge, La., in the west relay reports and, as they do, BellSouth undertakes a kind of telecommunications triage, pushing certain projects to the top of the list, like repairing lines to hospitals and fire stations. Helping cellphone companies connect their towers to BellSouth's switching centers is another priority. To provide mobile phone service, cellphone providers route calls from their towers over local and long-distance networks to towers near those who will receive the call. Some of the towers in the region were swept away in the storm, while others lost connection with wider networks. Still others are running on backup power. Not unexpectedly, BellSouth has been inundated with requests from federal and state agencies rushing to the region. For example, officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, asked BellSouth to install more than 1,000 phone lines in the Mississippi Coast Coliseum, a few blocks from the shore in Biloxi. Engineers ran over to the building to inspect equipment. By the time they determined it was operable, FEMA had decided to move into the Imperial Palace casino and hotel farther inland. [On Sunday BellSouth installed 1,200 phone lines; FEMA wants 2,800 more.] BellSouth is also racing to restore service to banks, which rely on data lines so they can clear paychecks for customers needing cash. For now, many banks are clearing transactions manually. Apart from the highest priorities, BellSouth is working from the fringes of the damaged zone inward, fixing the easiest projects first. In Mobile, which sustained less damage than the Mississippi coast, Chris Henkin, a technician, was busy all week reattaching phone lines knocked down by wind and trees. Since Tuesday, he has started his rounds at 7 a.m. and finished around 9 p.m., completing about a dozen projects a day. Like most BellSouth employees, he is now on a 13-day shift and will take only one day off before starting another shift. Despite the ordeal, Mr. Henkin, who joined BellSouth after Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida in 1992, says he has never been prouder of what he does, especially helping older people left alone during the storm and without family nearby. ''Now, the customers are saying, 'Thank you, thank you,' instead of, 'Why weren't you here yesterday?''' he said with a smile. Mr. Henkin is about to get more help. BellSouth is mobilizing to bring in hundreds of current and former employees from outside the area. Before they arrive, though, it has to determine what areas need attention most. As important, BellSouth must find them transportation, food and accommodations, all in short supply. Some will bunk in one of the circus-size tents BellSouth set up on a baseball field outside Gulfport. There, the company has set up 400 cots, toilets, showers, a makeshift cafeteria and a communications center where, on Saturday evening, the Internet connection went down because of another break in the fiber lines. With hundreds of thousands of refugees in the region, keeping BellSouth's own workers and their families going is a huge task. Standing in a tent filled with pillows, diapers, donated clothing and other sundries, Karen Rhyne, who is coordinating efforts at ''BellSouth City,'' said the company handed out ''tons of tarps and coolers'' to employees still living at home. Homeless employees and their families are moving in, many relying on interest-free loans that will be deducted from their paychecks later. And Wayne Mayes, a project manager who arrived from Kentucky Aug. 30, has spent a frustrating week just trying to get suppliers on the phone. ''The biggest problem has been the communications,'' Mr. Mayes said. ''All week long, we've been missing each other, back and forth, back and forth.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE PHONE LINES"
"They parked the van at the water's edge, some three blocks from the house, and plunged into the swamp. Knee-deep, Nils Breckoff dumped his cellphone into a blue plastic tub and hoisted it onto his shoulder. At thigh level, Heather Spicer hesitated, watching her boyfriend's waist disappear a few steps ahead. ''It's going to be up to my armpits,'' Ms. Spicer said. ''If you want me to go, I'll go,'' Mr. Breckoff said. ''No,'' she said. ''I have to see my house.'' So the couple crossed the street that had become a river, and soon stood waist-deep inside the living room that had become a lake, with Stephen King novels, tennis balls, and a pink souvenir candle from Cape Cod floating around the furniture. The file drawer containing Ms. Spicer's insurance papers was submerged, as was the cedar chest in the corner. ''My daughter's baptism dress is down there,'' she said as she pulled a portrait of 7-year-old Veronica down from atop the half-drowned desk. ''It's the same dress I was baptized in.'' Methodically filling the blue tub with clothes, framed photographs and the sodden papers, Ms. Spicer was one of thousands who took slow steps toward recovery on Monday morning, as residents of Jefferson Parish were allowed to return home for the first time since Hurricane Katrina hit. At the parish line on the highway, a wooden welcome sign had been knocked back at an awkward angle, but was still standing, an apt metaphor for how these sprawling suburbs south and west of New Orleans survived the storm. Some arrived to find mold growing on the ceiling and on their children's toys. Some had trees through their roofs, some no roofs at all. Driveway basketball hoops were flattened onto driveways, patio awnings dropped onto patios, utility poles stood at 45-degree angles, cars bobbed like boats or were crushed by debris. And then there were the lucky ones who discovered nothing much worse than a refrigerator full of rotten food. ''My big tree that I love so much is still standing,'' Gene Stevens, 50, said of the swamp cypress in the front lawn of the home she has lived in since 1983. ''Inside, everything there, high and dry, thank God. The anxiety of not knowing was almost worse than finding something when you got back.'' Surrounded by the same lake, river and canal as neighboring New Orleans, Jefferson Parish escaped the horrors that befell the city, in part because of the way the wind blew and the levees broke, in part because many of its 450,000 better-off residents evacuated earlier. Now, parish officials are rushing toward recovery, giving people four days to visit their property under a dusk-to-dawn curfew, then asking them to get out of the way as they try to rebuild the infrastructure. At first, they estimated it would take at least 90 days to make the 300-square-mile area inhabitable, then 45; Monday, the parish president, Aaron Broussard, said lights might be on and toilets flushing within three weeks. School officials, though, have said schools will not open before Dec. 1, and the only business that seemed open here on Monday morning in Metairie, the parish seat, was a Texaco station with a hundred cars in the queue. ''This is not the world that you knew from the Jefferson Parish that you left,'' Mr. Broussard warned in a radio interview broadcast as the first residents rolled in at 6 a.m. ''Go back to the movie 'Wizard of Oz.' Dorothy's hugging Toto. We're not in Kansas anymore.'' Mr. Broussard urged drivers to be extra careful, because with emergency personnel otherwise occupied, ''if you get in a wreck, no police is coming to pull you from a wreck. God forbid if you get injured, no ambulance is coming to get you.'' He told his exiled constituents to collect their valuables and children's school clothes, document damage with disposable cameras, and bury spoiled food since trash collectors would not come any time soon. So there was Justin Boudreaux, 25, digging a big hole in the median along Bonnabel Boulevard, just behind a World War I Memorial stone. ''Doing it by the memorial, see, we'll always remember this,'' laughed a neighbor, Harriet Cross, who supplied latex gloves and disinfectant for the communal food funeral. ''I get here this morning and there's four birds of paradise blooming in the yard,'' said Ms. Cross, who had little damage to the house where she has lived 47 of her 50 years, but is worried her flower shop next door will wither while the city is deserted. ''So it will come back.'' Many residents left their far-flung temporary homes in the wee hours expecting checkpoints to be choked, but when the magic hour of 6 a.m. arrived, police officers did not ask for identification, as the flashing road sign promised. The lines stretched back two miles on Airline Highway, six on Interstate 10, but the traffic moved in a steady stream. Drivers were welcomed with spray-painted road signs -- ''Generators for Sale, Saws, Supplies'' on one side, ''Hotel Closed'' at the Ramada a little ways down. At Prestige Auto Sales, torn American flags drooped from bent poles. A few traffic lights worked, and soldiers were stationed at other intersections, though they did little more than wave people through. On Homestead Avenue, a stoic man sprayed the inside of a fridge with bleach on the curb outside No. 1205, and a crying woman emerged from No. 1217 carrying a parakeet in a cage. On Transcontinental Boulevard, Stephanie Clouatre-Davis could only take small items from the town home where feces-flecked water covered the floor and mold dripped from the ceilings, because a huge fallen tree blocked the path out. The Fisher-Price kitchenette given to Ms. Clouatre-Davis's daughter, Emma, when she turned 2 on Aug. 28 was knocked over on the soggy carpet, its Mylar ''Happy Birthday'' balloon still attached. ''The mold is the worst thing for me,'' said Ms. Clouatre-Davis, 30, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in English and lost file cabinets full of notes for her dissertation to the mold. ''All my books -- that's like my life.'' At least she could park a pickup out front to cart things away. Across town, Ms. Spicer and Mr. Breckoff, who have been dating four months and who had left town on separate trips before the hurricane, unprepared, practically had to swim to even see what was left to take. Ms. Spicer had just agreed before the storm to sell the three-bedroom, two-bath, 1,700-square-foot home on Crestmont Drive for $360,000, but they had not closed. ''I have a feeling I'm not going to,'' she said as she trudged toward it. Out front, the fig tree she planted while pregnant sagged from the storm. In the guest bedroom, a mattress was a raft. Antique green velvet chairs were tipped backwards in the living room, and a carton of orange juice floated in the kitchen. Everything above waist level -- Veronica's pink fifth-place ribbon from a horse show, Ms. Spicer's sewing machine -- survived intact, but how to get it out through three flooded blocks? Ms. Spicer, a certified public accountant whose small New Orleans firm disappeared in the disaster, took suits off hangers and stuffed them into a garbage bag. Mr. Breckoff filled another with Veronica's things. A large wooden jewelry box, a couple pairs of black heels, a straw cowboy hat. Pictures, take the pictures. ''How much do you think you can carry?'' she asked. ''As much as I have to,'' he said. ''Get what you need, baby. I'll make as many trips as you need.'' STORM AND CRISIS: HOMECOMING"
"From spare harp strings to violin repairs to a place to live and practice, offers of help from around the country are pouring in to the musicians of the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Other orchestras, mostly regional ensembles where the pool of available musicians is small, are lending a hand, too. Many have offered temporary jobs or the prospect of auditions to the Philharmonic's 66 players, who have scattered around the country. All but one of the musicians had safely left the city or were already elsewhere for summer engagements, members of the orchestra said yesterday. The remaining player, Burton Callahan, a violinist, had been preparing to board an evacuation bus over the Labor Day weekend. ''It looks like he may have made it,'' said David Rosen, a cellist in the orchestra, who spoke from his parents' home in Santa Monica, Calif. ''He's not answering his phone. That's a good sign.'' He said Mr. Callahan continued to receive phone calls through the week despite the absence of service in most of the city. Drew McManus, a classical music consultant and commentator, opened up his blog (www.artsjournal.com/adaptistration) as a clearinghouse for the Louisiana musicians. He said he had verified the whereabouts of about 35 of them. The condition of the Orpheum Theater, where the orchestra is based, was not clear, but the central business district of New Orleans where it is located was flooded. Yesterday the orchestra management was trying to set up shop in Baton Rouge, the state capital, and was posting information on another Web site, groups.google.com/group/LPO-family. Job offers were posted there, too, including one from a charter school outside Phoenix looking for a music teacher. ''There's just tons of support out there,'' said Karen Sanno, a Louisiana Philharmonic violinist who drove for 18 hours to her parents' home in Chicago as Katrina was closing in. ''It's really amazing.'' But maybe not surprising. The orchestra world is close-knit, with musicians forming networks as early as music camps, which then solidify through summer festivals, conservatory training and the tramp from orchestra to orchestra over the years. ''I think everybody is reaching out to those they identify with the most closely,'' Ms. Sanno added. ''They can imagine the situations.'' The McManus site lists scores of offers, including housing and jobs. One poster offered extra harp strings. A violinmaker in Maine offered free repairs or instrument loans. The conductor of a community orchestra in Andover, Mass., offered housing and contacts with Boston-area freelancers. A composition software company held out jobs demonstrating its product. A horn-playing couple in Keller, Tex., offered to line up students for wind players. A Brooklyn College faculty member proposed the opportunity of teaching master classes there. Daniel L. Baldwin, a composer in Oklahoma, said he did not have much money but could offer a room and the chance of a recital. In a telephone interview, he said he could try to use his connections at Northwestern Oklahoma State University in Alva. ''I know if it was me down there I would need and want some help,'' he said. Many of those offering housing made it clear that there was space and tolerance for practicing. The Arkansas Symphony Orchestra advertised substitute jobs for five violins, a cello and a double bass throughout the season, with the promise that members would put Louisiana Philharmonic musicians up in their homes. Other institutions offering work or auditions included the Washington National Opera, Shreveport Symphony, Tuscaloosa Symphony, Illinois Symphony, Alabama Symphony, Baton Rouge Symphony and Memphis Symphony. By Monday, at least three players already had offers of playing or teaching work. ''Musicians understand exactly how difficult it is to get even a low-paying job to begin with,'' Mr. McManus said. The Louisiana Philharmonic has a resilience all its own. After the New Orleans Symphony collapsed amid heavy debts, the players in 1991 formed the Louisiana Philharmonic. For several years, they worked for a pittance while paying off the debt. The orchestra had made its way back to health, with a budget of $4 million, about 75 concerts a year and a new music director starting in 2006, Carlos Miguel Prieto. It is one of the few professional American orchestras run by the players themselves. ''It's a very strongly bonded family,'' Mr. Rosen, the cellist, said. But now, like every aspect of life in New Orleans, the Louisiana Philharmonic's future lies in doubt. Ken Kussman, the orchestra's operations manager, said it might be possible to set up operation outside the city, possibly at the Pontchartrain Center in Kenner, La., where the orchestra plays five concerts a year. ''There is that spirit of wanting to keep it going,'' said Mr. Kussman, who was staying at a corporate apartment in Texas and planned to leave yesterday for Baton Rouge. ''The problem now is the logistics of everything.'' Speaking of orchestra members, he continued, ''At least before they could gather in one room and argue about it.'' ''I think it will survive,'' he added. ''I don't know what form it will survive in. We just don't know what New Orleans will be like when this is all over. What will the population be like? How many people will return? It's been a very searing experience.''"
"As President Bush and administration officials fanned out across the Gulf Coast in the White House's campaign to deal with criticism that they had failed in managing the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, there was one unexpected face in their crowd on Monday: former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Clinton was at Reliant Center next to the Astrodome in Houston, where about 3,800 homeless New Orleans residents had decamped, standing next to former President George Bush as they announced the creation of the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund to help hurricane victims. After that, the two former presidents, along with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, toured the shelter, while President Bush visited storm-struck areas of Mississippi and Louisiana, providing a flow of television images suggesting a concerned White House on the march. Mr. Clinton's visit to the Houston shelter on Monday is the latest time the former president has come to the current president's aid in his second term, from early in the year when Mr. Bush was criticized for his slow response to the tsunami, to initially defending the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina at the White House last week, to praising the credentials of Judge John G. Roberts Jr., Mr. Bush's choice for the Supreme Court. And it offered what many Democrats described as a vivid, if slightly disconcerting, insight into the complicated and increasingly transactional relationship between the Bush and Clinton families. While officials in both parties said they had no doubt that both men were first and foremost intent on helping Americans, they also took note of the web of political benefits spun by this burgeoning alliance. It helps Mr. Bush during the roughest time of his presidency, Mr. Clinton as he tries to establish himself as a respected and admired former president and Mrs. Clinton as she potentially prepares to run for president in 2008. For President Bush, Mr. Clinton's agreement to a request by the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., to join former President Bush in their second fund-raising project could hardly have been better timed. One of the crucial elements of a White House strategy to help Mr. Bush recover from the rounds of criticism he received in the wake of the disaster in New Orleans was to present him as above politics, and to avoid any kind of political entanglements with Democrats. ''It definitely helps Bush,'' said Douglas Sosnik, who was White House political director under Mr. Clinton. ''Given what has happened to Bush in the last six or seven days, there is not a single aspect of this crisis at all that can be positive to Bush. So anything he can do to get politics out of this -- given how vulnerable he is politically -- the better for him.'' At the same time, the political benefits for the former president and Mrs. Clinton were at least as striking. Mr. Clinton has been engaged in a campaign to establish himself as a respected force in American life after a rather messy departure from the White House, using his foundation for prominent work in the fight against AIDS in Africa. He is also trying to be less polarizing than he was when he left the White House, an effort to become less of a political weight if, as expected, Mrs. Clinton runs for president, friends said. The presence of Mr. Clinton next to Mr. Bush will make it that much harder, some Democrats said, for Republicans to attack the Clintons. ''Isn't it interesting that Bush realizes he's in trouble and he has to phone President Clinton for cover?'' said Bob Mulholland, a Democratic leader from California. ''Bush is standing next to President Clinton for cover. You've got all these photos of President Clinton with both Bushes. It's hard for a Republican in the national arena to be attacking the Clintons with these kind of images out there.'' White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Clinton's spokesman, Jay Carson, said of Mr. Clinton's involvement: ''In a time of crisis like this, it is President Clinton's nature to do everything he can to help victims. His involvement is tied to nothing other than to help the tens of thousands of victims of the hurricane.'' Still, the situation was complicated Monday. Mr. Clinton seemed to be struggling to be diplomatic in talking about the administration's response to the hurricane damage. He told CNN that ''we failed once, but we don't want to fail a second time.'' But at times he seemed to be following the political directions of the White House in deferring questions about the past and turning them into questions about the future. ''It's an appropriate thing to look into, but not at this time -- they're still finding bodies there,'' Mr. Clinton said in Houston. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton was fierce in denouncing the administration, particularly for budget cuts it made to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''It was basically taken apart and denied funding,'' she said. Mrs. Clinton, in an interview, disputed the suggestion that her husband was joining hands with Mr. Bush and Mr. Bush. ''He is no longer in politics,'' she said. ''He is a former president with an enormous amount of influence and just as during the tsunami, he is willing to serve his country. He has expressed strong feelings about the way this has been handled. My role is different. I'm on the front lines dealing with these issues day to day.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE FORMER PRESIDENT"
"On a cold winter night in 1953, the Netherlands suffered a terrifying blow as old dikes and seawalls gave way during a violent storm. Flooding killed nearly 2,000 people and forced the evacuation of 70,000 others. Icy waters turned villages and farm districts into lakes dotted with dead cows. Ultimately, the waters destroyed more than 4,000 buildings. Afterward, the Dutch -- realizing that the disaster could have been much worse, since half the country, including Amsterdam and Rotterdam, lies below sea level -- vowed never again. After all, as Tjalle de Haan, a Dutch public works official, put it in an interview last week, ''Here, if something goes wrong, 10 million people can be threatened.'' So at a cost of some $8 billion over a quarter century, the nation erected a futuristic system of coastal defenses that is admired around the world today as one of the best barriers against the sea's fury -- one that could withstand the kind of storm that happens only once in 10,000 years. The Dutch case is one of many in which low-lying cities and countries with long histories of flooding have turned science, technology and raw determination into ways of forestalling disaster. London has built floodgates on the Thames River. Venice is doing the same on the Adriatic. Japan is erecting superlevees. Even Bangladesh has built concrete shelters on stilts as emergency havens for flood victims. Experts in the United States say the foreign projects are worth studying for inspiration about how to rebuild New Orleans once the deadly waters of Hurricane Katrina recede into history. ''They have something to teach us,'' said George Z. Voyiadjis, head of civil and environmental engineering at Louisiana State University. ''We should capitalize on them for building the future here.'' Innovations are happening in the United States as well. California is experimenting with ''smart'' levees wired with nervous systems of electronic sensors that sound alarms if a weakening levee threatens to open a breach, giving crews time to make emergency repairs. ''It's catching on,'' said William F. Kane, president of Kane GeoTech Inc., a company in Stockton, Calif., that wires levees and other large structures with failure sensors. ''There's a lot of potential for this kind of thing.'' While scientists hail the power of technology to thwart destructive forces, they note that flood control is a job for nature at least as much as for engineers. Long before anyone built levees and floodgates, barrier islands were serving to block dangerous storm surges. Of course, those islands often fall victim to coastal development. ''You'll never be able to control nature,'' said Rafael L. Bras, an environmental engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who consults on the Venetian project. ''The best way is to understand how nature works and make it work in our favor.'' In humanity's long struggle against the sea, the Dutch experience in 1953 was a grim milestone. The North Sea flood produced the kind of havoc that became all too familiar on the Gulf Coast last week. When a crippled dike threatened to give way and let floodwaters spill into Rotterdam, a boat captain -- like the brave little Dutch boy with the quick finger -- steered his vessel into the breach, sinking his ship and saving the city. ''We were all called upon to collect clothes and food for the disaster victims,'' recalled Jelle de Boer, a Dutch high school student at the time who is now an emeritus professor of geology at Wesleyan University. ''Cows were swimming around. They'd stand when they could, shivering and dying. It was a terrible mess.'' The reaction was intense and manifold. Linking offshore islands with dams, seawalls and other structures, the Dutch erected a kind of forward defensive shield, drastically reducing the amount of vulnerable coastline. Mr. de Haan, director of the water branch of the Road and Hydraulic Engineering Institute of the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, said the project had the effect of shortening the coast by more than 400 miles. For New Orleans, experts say, a similar forward defense would seal off Lake Pontchartrain from the Gulf of Mexico. That step would eliminate a major conduit by which hurricanes drive storm surges to the city's edge -- or, as in the case of Katrina, through the barriers. The Dutch also increased the height of their dikes, which now loom as much as 40 feet above the churning sea. (In New Orleans, the tallest flood walls are about half that size.) The government also erected vast complexes of floodgates that close when the weather turns violent but remain open at other times, so saltwater can flow into estuaries, preserving their ecosystems and the livelihoods that depend on them. The Netherlands maintains large teams of inspectors and maintenance crews that safeguard the sprawling complex, which is known as Delta Works. The annual maintenance bill is about $500 million. ''It's not cheap,'' Mr. de Haan said. ''But it's not so much in relation to the gross national product. So it's a kind of insurance.'' The 1953 storm also pounded Britain. Along the Thames, flooding killed more than 300 people, ruined farmland and frightened Londoners, whose central city narrowly escaped disaster. The British responded with a plan to better regulate tidal surges sweeping up the Thames from the North Sea. Engineers designed an attractive barrier meant to minimize interference with the river's natural flow. It went into service in 1982 at Woolwich, about 10 miles east of central London. Normally, its semicircular gates lie flush to the riverbed in concrete supporting sills, creating no obstacle to river traffic. When the need arises, the gates pivot up, rising as high as a five-story building to block rising waters. The authorities have raised the Thames barrier more than 80 times. In Venice, the precipitating event was a 1966 flood that caused wide damage and economic loss. The upshot was an ambitious plan known as the Moses Project, named after the biblical parting of the Red Sea. Its 78 gargantuan gates would rest on the floor of the Adriatic Sea and rise when needed to block dangerous tidal surges. Long debate over the project's merits repeatedly delayed the start of construction until May 2003. Opponents claim that the $4.5 billion effort will prove ineffective while threatening to kill the fragile lagoon in which Venice sits. In theory, the gates are to be completed by 2010. ''People fight doing things like this,'' said Dr. Bras, of M.I.T. ''But when disaster strikes you realize how important it is to think ahead.'' Planners did just that in Bangladesh after a 1991 hurricane created huge storm surges that killed more than 130,000 people. World charities helped build hundreds of concrete shelters on stilts, which in recent storms have saved thousands of lives. In Japan, a continuous battle against flooding in dense urban areas has produced an effort to develop superlevees. Unlike the customary mounds of earth, sand and rock that hold back threatening waters, they are broad expanses of raised land meant to resist breaks and withstand overflows. The approach being tried in California relies on a technology known as time-domain reflectometry. It works on the same principle as radar: a pulse of energy fired down a coaxial cable bounces back when it reaches the end or a distortion, like a bend or crimp. Careful measurement of the echoes traveling back along the cable can disclose serious distortions and danger. Dr. Kane, of Kane GeoTech, has installed such a system in the Sacramento River delta, along a levee that is threatening to fail. Could such a system have saved New Orleans? ''It would have given them more information,'' said Charles H. Dowding, a top expert on the technology at Northwestern University. ''The failure of a levee would have been detected.'' But experts say it is still unclear whether such a warning would have been enough to prevent the catastrophic breaches. Dr. Bras says sensor technologies for detecting levee failure hold much promise. But he adds that less glamorous approaches, like regular maintenance, may be even more valuable, since prevention is always the best cure. ''We have to learn that things have to be reviewed, revised, maintained and repaired as needed,'' he said. ''To see a city like New Orleans suffer such devastation -- some of that was preventable.'' He added that no matter how ambitious the coastal engineering, no matter how innovative and well maintained, the systems of levees, seawalls and floodgates were likely to suffer sporadic failures. ''Nature will throw big things at us once in a while,'' he said. ''There's always the possibility that nature will trump us.''"
"The six-seater Cessna was flying low and slow along the Gulf Coast. Two coastal researchers, straining against their seatbelts, were leaning out a gaping hole where the port side door had been removed, photographing overwashed sand, piles of seagrass and new inlets, the marks left on the region's barrier islands by Hurricane Katrina. But then the plane banked sharply, and the researchers aimed their cameras landward, toward Waveland, Miss., or what was left of it. ''My God. My God,'' said Robert S. Young as he caught his first sight of what would be miles of desolate landscape where houses, stores, churches, hotels and other structures used to be. Neighborhood after neighborhood appeared to have been raked clear, with nothing but concrete slabs to say where buildings had stood. Far into the woods, boards and beams and other remnants of these buildings lay in piles, a wrack line of debris left where the storm had dropped it. In Gulfport and Biloxi, wrecked casino barges lay across city streets or leaned against high-rise buildings, some tilted on their sides, all with windows blown out. Where railroad and highway bridges once ran, there were only platoons of pylons marching into the water. Here and there a truck or S.U.V. moved slowly down sand-choked roads, but there were few other signs of life. ''I have been on the scene of every major hurricane'' since Hurricane Hugo, said Dr. Young, a geologist at Western Carolina University who has been studying coastal storms since 1989, when he was a graduate student assigned to measure that storm's impact. ''This is the worst I have ever seen.'' Since Hurricane Katrina struck, much of the nation's attention has been on New Orleans, where overtopped and breached levees stranded tens of thousands of residents and left much of the city under water. But the scientists on the plane, Dr. Young and Andrew S. Coburn, associate director of the Duke University Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines, are looking instead at the Gulf Coast, where the storm came ashore. They and other researchers are mapping changes in beach formations, patterns of damage, debris fields, wind and water flow, and inland and offshore topography for clues about why this storm was so destructive, and so deadly. The work is part of scientists' continuing efforts to engage coastal officials and policy makers on how to make the coast safer -- and on whether some parts of the coast can ever be made safe enough. ''We have never learned that lesson,'' said Abby Sallenger, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey who has studied storm effects on the East and Gulf coasts for years. Dr. Sallenger does not advocate wholesale retreat from the coast, he said, but ''the coastal research community should come together and come to some conclusions about where it is safer to go.'' ''What's happened before is you come back and you not only rebuild, you rebuild bigger,'' he continued, but ''there are some places where you should think twice about putting up a pup tent.'' Scientists who want this point to be heard, and who think Hurricane Katrina may be an ideal opportunity to make it, are eager to obtain as much good data as possible about the storm and its effects. For example, Shea Penland, director of the Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of New Orleans, said analysis of debris fields would be illuminating. ''Debris tells you how high the water was, how fast it was moving, where it was going, where were the soft spots,'' he said. Researchers from Florida International University and the University of Florida are studying data from 10 portable towers, fortified to survive winds of more than 200 miles per hour and equipped with instruments to measure wind speed and direction at ground level and at 15 and then 30 feet above the ground. Much real-time data transmission was halted during the storm when cellphone systems failed, said Stephen P. Leatherman, who heads the International Hurricane Research Center at F.I.U. But instruments on the towers stored their data and researchers should be able to obtain detailed measurements, he said. Scientists like Dr. Sallenger are also trying to improve estimates of likely hurricane impact by going beyond barometric pressure and wind speeds, the basis of the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, to include factors like the elevation of the landscape and the shape of the beach where a storm might strike. Advancing this goal was one of the reasons Dr. Young and Dr. Coburn took to the air. Their chartered plane took off early Friday afternoon from the Pensacola Aviation Center here, and they spent the next four hours flying as far west as Grand Island, La., 180 miles away. There was very little air traffic, and that was good, said the pilot, Gene Giles, better known as Skip, because it was not clear that air traffic control was operating normally. When the small plane crossed paths with military helicopters, as happened two or three times, the researchers held on as Mr. Giles wigwagged to signal he had seen them. At one point, the plane banked sharply to avoid a C-130 that was coming in over the Gulf, heading for a landing at Biloxi. One of the first places the researchers photographed was Dauphin Island, a 15-mile strip of sand at the mouth of Mobile Bay. Dauphin Island is regularly breached by coastal storms, and its mainland bridge was knocked out in Hurricane Frederick in 1979. Many coastal researchers regard it as an outstanding example of unwise coastal development. ''We paid $38 million for a new bridge,'' after the hurricane, said Orrin H. Pilkey Jr., director of Dr. Coburn's program, who has been an ardent advocate of retreat from hazardous coastlines since his parents experienced Hurricane Camille on this coast in 1969. ''There was a brief period when they debated not rebuilding the bridge,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''but they did, and development skyrocketed on.'' Even on its east end, where elevations are relatively high and the island's dune system is relatively robust, there were clear signs of storm damage. A row of groins stood out in the water, the beach they were meant to protect having eroded away behind them. A sea wall of rock riprap was out to sea. The ocean had overtopped it. But it was on the west end of Dauphin Island that devastating storm damage was most apparent. This part of the island had long since been without protective dunes. Some houses were simply gone, leaving nothing but pilings. In places, the island's one road was obliterated. And everywhere, there were huge fans of sand on the island's back side, sand that had washed over from its ocean beach, leaving stranded houses seemingly wading on pilings into the surf. On a developed barrier, like Dauphin Island, this sand movement is a disaster. ''It's as if the island is sliding out from under the houses,'' Dr. Young observed as the plane flew over them. But on undeveloped islands, it is a normal and advantageous response to rising sea levels -- as sand washes toward the back of the island it is, in effect, retreating away from the ocean. Sand that washes from the ocean sides of the islands is deposited in their marshy bayside fringes, where it is left in large fans. Eventually, this sand is colonized by beach grass and other plants. New marshes form on its landward fringes. The island will look the same; it will just be farther landward. Dr. Young and Dr. Coburn could see this process at work as the plane flew over Petit Bois, Horn and other uninhabited islands of Gulf Islands National Seashore -- more evidence, Dr. Young said, that damage to barrier islands is largely a matter of interference by people, ''a human tragedy,'' as he put it. ''It's amazing how much better natural shorelines look after a storm than developed shorelines,'' he said. Once the plane reached Waveland, Miss., however, there was little to feel good about. When a storm like this makes landfall, pushing a wall of water with it, nothing along the beachfront will survive the assault, even structures built to withstand high winds. ''Nothing can withstand waves,'' Dr. Pilkey said. Under assault by a storm surge, most structures simply fall apart, and their debris batters buildings behind them, ''missile-ing,'' Dr. Pilkey called it. ''Stuff is thrown back into the next house and it doesn't have a chance,'' he said. Eventually the debris piles up and forms a kind of dike, which breaks the action of storm water and offers some protection to structures behind it. Dr. Coburn and Dr. Young have seen this kind of wrack line of debris before. But this time, they said, it was unusually far inland, testimony to the hurricane's strength. When coastal scientists survey storm damage, they often speak cynically about people who have chosen to build their houses in harm's way. This time, for Dr. Coburn and Dr. Young, it was different. ''It's hard to be callous,'' Dr. Young said as Mr. Giles sent the plane on another sweep along what remained of the Gulfport, Miss., shoreline. ''People lived here. People's lives are scattered around down there.'' Dr. Sallenger, of the Geological Survey, said he hoped that as events unfolded in coastal Mississippi and nearby, the realization of what occurred there would bring scientists and policymakers together. ''There are a lot of smart people from the research guys to the engineers to the people who build these things,'' he said. As people consider how and what to rebuild, he said, ''Let's just do it better.''"
"After stalling at sea for a week, Hurricane Ophelia battered the coast of North Carolina on Wednesday, spawning blinding rains that flooded beach communities and left thousands farther inland without power. The storm, rated Category 1 by the National Weather Service with sustained winds of 85 miles an hour, is expected to scrape the shoreline from Cape Fear to the Outer Banks through Thursday, where a northeasterly track may take it out to sea. Officials said that voluntary evacuations went smoothly and that by 3 p.m. Wednesday, 519 people had taken refuge in shelters. Residents and officials alike said the cataclysmic effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans and the Gulf Coast had made little difference in how they responded to the storm. ''We felt we were as prepared as we could be,'' said Mayor Spence Broadhurst of Wilmington. ''Katrina didn't play any role in the process. We have a very clear plan.'' Still, Mr. Broadhurst added, ''I wouldn't be human if the effects of that storm did not have an effect on my thought process.'' State officials agreed. ''Unfortunately, we have a history with hurricanes,'' said Lt. Everett Clendenin, a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety. ''We have a fairly standard operating process.'' But Stephen Barnett, executive director of the American Red Cross's Cape Fear chapter, said he thought Hurricane Katrina had some bearing on the decisions people had made. ''I think just the fact that there were so many individuals who had not adequately prepared in New Orleans, I think they took extra precautions,'' Mr. Barnett said of residents here. ''I think they planned better and took the storm more seriously. People both increased supplies and got out sooner.'' The Associated Press reported that President Bush issued an emergency declaration for 37 counties in eastern North Carolina, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts. By 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 519 people had taken refuge in eight shelters in the coastal counties of Brunswick, New Hanover and Pender. At least two trees fell on houses in Wilmington, a quaint city sandwiched between the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and the Cape Fear River, near North Carolina's southeastern tip. A giant old live oak was seen toppled to its side on Market Street, a major thoroughfare. Oceanside communities like Topsail Island, Carolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach took hard hits and were expected to experience heavy beach erosion. Carolina Beach reported flooding as high as one foot in some neighborhoods. Streets were flooded in sections of Surf City, north of Wilmington. Sheets of rain pushed sideways across its small boardwalk area. The white-sand beach could not be seen for the heavy surf. About 15 miles inland from Topsail Island, where strong winds howled and waves battered the beach, David Paul stood outside the hot dog restaurant that has carried his family's name for three generations, watching a stand of sycamore trees bend on the other side of a deserted highway. ''It was tedious before it ever got here,'' Mr. Paul said. ''We've been watching this storm all week.'' At the Sloop Point Volunteer Fire Department station near Surf City, firefighters awaited the storm's arrival Wednesday night, ending a week of mild tension and anticipation as the hurricane stalled and wobbled its way south of the state line. ''It's kind of like a kid at Christmas, just wanting to know what you're going to get,'' said Assistant Chief Scott Bradshaw. ''But once the storm is here that Christmas-like feeling is definitely over. Then you're happy to see it go away.''"
"David Reeves drove his pickup down a country road littered with pine trees snapped as easily as matchsticks, electric wires tossed spaghettilike across the asphalt, and a variety of roadkill: armadillos, raccoons, nutria, dogs. Then he arrived at the roadblock here at the Intercoastal Waterway, where he waited on Monday. ''In all my travels I've never seen anything like this,'' said Mr. Reeves, 47, an oilfield technician who grew up 20 minutes from the coastline, in Hackberry, a small ranching town in Cameron Parish, just to the south of here. Mr. Reeves has worked in the last year in Angola, Morocco and Brunei. With a mouthful of Skoal, he described how he had once persuaded customs officials in Luanda to turn a blind eye to a package of Louisiana alligator meat in his luggage. ''Now I can't get past my own deputy sheriff,'' an irritated Mr. Reeves said, explaining that he was trying to get food and water to his two brothers in Cameron, the most southwestern of Louisiana's parishes, where coastal areas were torn apart over the weekend by Hurricane Rita. Indeed, at the roadblock, the police and two soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division let the occasional truck loaded with horses or cattle go by but otherwise barred civilians from entering the parish on Monday. Randy Hunt, a deputy Cameron Parish sheriff, said flooding, natural-gas leaks and a lack of electricity simply made it too dangerous. ''It's just pure devastation,'' Mr. Hunt said. Cameron Parish has a population of almost 10,000. Photographs taken from helicopters show its coastline in tatters, with one community, Holly Beach, effectively wiped off the map. The storm's destructive path was evident enough on a drive here from Sulphur, a nearby town to the north. Tractor-trailers floated in the marsh. Gas stations were demolished. ''The cattle seem to have been pretty lucky so far,'' said Mr. Hunt, who rode out the storm at a Best Western hotel in Sulphur. ''I doubt the gators have been as lucky.'' As military helicopters flew over the checkpoint on Monday, Mr. Reeves was hardly the only driver left fuming. One of the others was Ian Cormie, an official with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which stores the nation's emergency oil supply in underground salt caverns along the gulf coastline. Mr. Cormie said early Monday afternoon that he had been waiting at the roadblock since 6:30 a.m. after trying to return home from Dallas, where he stayed with friends during the storm. ''I'm fed up,'' he said. ''I want to see my home.'' Officials believe that only in Hackberry, in the northern part of the parish, did some people refuse to evacuate. All those who stayed apparently survived, the officials said. But shrimpers worry that they will have no place to take their catch. Owners of fishing and hunting camps worry that they will lose rental income. On Sunday, some residents ignored the authorities and, after slipping flat-bottomed boats into the bayous, floated south to check on property. A few, especially those with homes on relatively high ground, returned with good news. ''We are so, so happy,'' said Cathy Munson, 55, who had gone with three of her brothers to check on the house of their 76-year-old mother, which suffered wind damage but did not flood. ''It's much better than what we were expecting.'' Ms. Munson grew up 28 feet above sea level, on one of the highest parts of Hackberry, directly on top of a natural salt dome. But that town, where family farms have hundreds of acres of beef cattle pastures and grazing marshes, is almost 20 miles inland. Much closer to the gulf, communities like Holly Beach, which has fewer than 200 people, seem to have disappeared. ''No people, no nothing,'' a Navy helicopter crewman, Ken Smith, said after touring the coast. Even if everyone from the parish is safe, said Richard. A. Brown, a tugboat captain, the devastation will be no small thing. For instance, if the town of Cameron is lost, Mr. Brown said, it could affect operations for the oil companies that use the town as a base for flying personnel and supplies to their rigs by helicopter. Still, he said, there is something good about the storm's having chosen so rural an area to deliver one of its heaviest blows. ''Anything more populated,'' he said, ''it would have been ungodly.'' As helicopters flew overhead on Sunday, some carrying journalists taking aerial photographs, Mr. Brown relied on a different kind of visual assessment to weigh the damage. He had spent the night of the storm on the boat he captains, like more than a dozen other people on several boats. The next day, he said, he saw appliances floating in the floodwaters. ''There were hundreds of refrigerators,'' he said. ''And where there was a refrigerator, there was once a kitchen.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE LOUISIANA COAST"
"HOUSTON BIDS HURRICANE GOODBYE -- Flights at Houston's two major airports, disrupted Friday and into the weekend by the threat of Hurricane Rita, were back to normal yesterday. Continental Airlines, which has its largest hub at George Bush Intercontinental, said it was operating a full schedule yesterday with the resumption of Continental Express and Continental Connection flights. Houston Hobby was also back on track. Most airlines eased penalties for ticket cancellations and rebookings. MOVIES, ETC. -- Which airlines offer the best in-flight entertainment systems? Qantas Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways, according to the World Airline Entertainment Association. At the trade group's annual convention last week in Hamburg, Germany, Qantas and Virgin were named best over all, among large-size fleet and midsize fleet carriers respectively, for in-flight video, audio, interactive and other entertainment offerings. Runners-up in the large-fleet category were Emirates, Air Canada and AMR's American Airlines. In the midsize fleet category, the runner-up was LAN. EOS SETS FIRST FLIGHT -- Eos, the new luxury airline that will fly between New York Kennedy and London Stansted using Boeing 757 jets outfitted with just 48 seats, said it was accepting reservations for its daily round-trip service, which the airline said would start Nov. 1, six weeks later than its earlier start-up estimate. The airline also announced a sale to celebrate its start: $1,500 off the regular $6,500 round-trip fare. HOW TO HANDLE US AIR MERGER What to expect short-term from the merger of US Airways and America West, which takes effect today? A guide issued yesterday by the new airline, which will take the US Air name, advises continuing to book directly with either US Air or America West, whose Web sites will operate separately in the short term. At airports, check in with whichever airline is listed as the flight operator on your ticket. JOE SHARKEY ITINERARIES"
"When Congress agreed this spring to tighten the bankruptcy laws and crack down on consumers who took on debt irresponsibly, no one had the victims of Hurricane Katrina in mind. But four weeks after New Orleans flooded and tens of thousands of other residents of the Gulf Coast also lost their homes and livelihoods, a stricter new personal bankruptcy law scheduled to take effect on Oct. 17 is likely to deliver another blow to those dislocated by the storm. The law was intended to keep individuals from taking on debts they had no intention of paying off. But many once-solvent Katrina victims are likely to be caught up in the net intended to catch deadbeats. Right after Hurricane Katrina struck, several lawmakers -- mostly Democrats but including some Senate Republicans -- suggested that storm victims along the Gulf Coast should get relief from the new law's stricter provisions, which are intended to screen filers by income and make those with higher incomes repay their debts over several years. Under the old law, which remains in effect until mid-October, many more filers can have their debts canceled quickly in federal bankruptcy courts. But House Republicans, who fought off a proposed amendment that would have made bankruptcy filings easier for victims of natural disasters, said there was no reason to carve out a broad exemption just because of the storm. Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, rejected the notion of reopening the legislation, saying it already included provisions that would ensure that people left ''down and out'' by the storm would still be able to shed most of their debts. Lawmakers who lost the long fight over the law, he said, ''ought to get over it,'' according to The Associated Press. A White House spokesman, Trent Duffy, said the administration ''doesn't see a lot of merit'' in calls to delay the law's effective date but was considering making allowances for hurricane victims. In the meantime, many victims of Hurricane Katrina -- and the much smaller group ruined by Hurricane Rita -- will face a kind of Catch-22. Those who try to beat the Oct. 17 deadline in hopes of filing under the less-onerous current law may find it impossible to do so, because residence rules generally require that individuals seek protection against creditors in their hometowns. (Assuming people in New Orleans can find their lawyers and records, they can file for bankruptcy protection in their bankruptcy court, which has reopened and is sharing space with another court in Baton Rouge.) Moreover, most people displaced by the storm will probably not know for months if they even need to file for bankruptcy. By that time, the tougher new law will be in force. ''Six to nine months from now, FEMA will be gone, the church groups will be gone and creditors will once more be demanding their money,'' said Bradford W. Botes, a bankruptcy lawyer whose firm represented victims of Hurricane Ivan, which struck Florida a year ago. Keith and Bridget Cloud are among those already worrying about how to pay their bills while picking up the pieces of their lives. Mr. Cloud, 39, has owned a lawn care business in New Orleans for 12 years, employing four people. Ms. Cloud, 38, was a group-home manager for a nonprofit agency that sheltered homeless people. Two years ago, they bought a house, moved in with their five children and began paying down their mortgage. ''We weren't millionaires or anything, but we were just making it,'' Ms. Cloud said in a telephone interview from Houston last week, as the couple and their three oldest children were fleeing again, this time from the threat of Hurricane Rita, decamping temporarily in Laredo, Tex., and then in Corpus Christi. (Their two younger children are with relatives in Alabama.) ''If we have to file,'' Ms. Cloud said, ''don't make it harder for us than it already is.'' Personal and business bankruptcy filings usually reach a peak two to three years after a hurricane, according to a study about bankruptcy and hurricanes, soon to be published in The Nevada Law Journal, by Robert M. Lawless, a law professor at the University of Nevada. Mr. Lawless said he was surprised by the pattern. Previous research on bankruptcy filings and natural disasters had not shown a connection, he said, apparently because analysts were looking only at the months immediately after floods or storms. He said his finding was in keeping with research on the overall level of economic activity after hurricanes, which shows there is often a short-term growth spurt as federal aid and construction money are pumped into disaster areas. The bankruptcy filings come later, as people who have lost their houses or jobs are overwhelmed by the debts they incur while trying to rebuild. ''Areas hit by major hurricanes will suffer great financial distress and that distress will linger for long after the media glare has disappeared,'' Mr. Lawless writes. Defenders of the new law note that judges will still have the discretion to waive its strict restrictions on filing under Chapter 7, a faster and simpler type of bankruptcy that, among other things, allows consumers to walk away from some obligations. ''There's nothing in the bill to suggest that you can get blood from a stone,'' Todd J. Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University, said in an interview last week between Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. ''The new legislation is perfectly suited to deal with circumstances such as this.'' Mr. Zywicki said that as drafted, the new law still gave judges the discretion to identify victims of ''special circumstances,'' like hurricanes, and to let them use Chapter 7 provisions. But consumer bankruptcy lawyers worry that there is little incentive in the law for judges to give hurricane victims a break. They also complain about a long list of new demands it makes on individuals. Among the hurdles in the new law that could most affect hurricane victims is a means test. It requires debtors to provide an estimate of their income by taking an average of their most recent six months' earnings before they can file under Chapter 7. Debtors with higher incomes are to be kept in bankruptcy status for several years, to pay off their debts. But ''someone who had a great job just before Katrina may have a very different income today,'' Mr. Botes, the bankruptcy lawyer, noted. The new law also requires every individual to undergo credit counseling before filing for bankruptcy protection. ''It's not right to make people who lost everything go through a course about how to manage their finances,'' Mr. Botes said. The law has stiffer requirements as well for what records must be produced by the debtor. But hurricane victims will have a hard time doing that. ''Thousands and thousands of people no longer have checkbooks, insurance papers, car titles (or cars), birth certificates, Social Security cards or wallets,'' a group of Louisiana lawyers said in a letter two weeks ago to the state's Congressional delegation. The harsher requirements already had thousands of consumers rushing to file bankruptcy petitions ahead of the deadline. Despite a strong economy, quarterly filings for the period from April through June jumped 11 percent from the quarter a year earlier, to a record 467,333, the American Bankruptcy Institute reported. Now, many previously solvent families and small businesses find themselves facing such pressure, but with little hope of getting into court ahead of the deadline. ''Think of the position of these debtors, many of whom would have not had to file bankruptcy otherwise,'' said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''They have until Oct. 17 to file under the old law that was less restrictive than this new law. But the odds that they can do that are pretty slim because the lawyers who would serve them are out in refugee camps somewhere.'' The Cloud family is a good example. After Hurricane Katrina hit, they left for Houston, where they lived for a couple of weeks in the Astrodome. The day after they were given a temporary apartment, Houston was evacuated for Hurricane Rita and they drove in a borrowed car to Laredo. Bouncing from place to place, they have found it hard to determine the extent of their losses in New Orleans. Mr. Cloud has returned to New Orleans just once so far. He found that the family house had been spared, but that his company's three trucks, only two fully paid for, had been destroyed. So the company will have to pay off a loan for one vehicle that no longer exists. His insurer will cover only part of the loss, and it has warned that it will not cover the vehicles' contents. Mr. Cloud stored his riding lawn mowers and other costly equipment aboard the trucks, so he will bear those losses himself. Ms. Cloud estimated that 80 percent of her husband's customers, mostly apartment complexes, were in the New Orleans flood zone. They have no idea when, if ever, the property owners will need his services again. While they wait, they are scraping together funds to buy new lawn care equipment and a truck. Ms. Cloud has already received her last paycheck, so they will have to dip into their savings, she said. She has requested a small-business loan application from FEMA, but the papers have not yet arrived. Meanwhile, bills are coming due. Ms. Cloud said she wondered if the family would end up in bankruptcy court. They had a near-miss once before, when her husband and his brother, then a co-owner of the lawn care business, had a dispute. They were able to resolve the problem without filing for bankruptcy, Ms. Cloud said, and she has been trying to call the New Orleans lawyer who helped them. So far, she has not been able to get a call through. Professor LoPucki said: ''These people could, I guess, go to bankruptcy lawyers in the places where they are. But they are supposed to file in New Orleans.'' Individuals are supposed to file wherever they have spent most of the previous 180 days. That will pose a problem for long-term evacuees. Michael D. Allday, a New Orleans lawyer, said he had one client, a single mother with medical bills exceeding $75,000, who had been planning to file for bankruptcy just before Katrina struck. ''Now she's lost her job on a riverboat casino,'' he said. The woman resettled in Little Rock, Ark., and Mr. Allday said he thought she should file there. But before she can do so, other bankruptcy lawyers noted, she will have to wait several months to fulfill the residence requirement. By that time, of course, the new law will be in force. Professor LoPucki said he thought the majority of lawmakers were averse to enacting blanket bankruptcy relief for hurricane victims because that might raise questions about why victims of other uncontrollable events -- like accidents, major illnesses or mass layoffs -- should not get a break, too. ''If you admit that the bill is bad for Katrina victims,'' he said, ''then there's really no reason it isn't bad for the others, too. They're all in some kind of problem. For most of them, it's largely their fault. But for a lot of them, it isn't their fault.'' The Old and the New Following are some of the differences between the current law and the new bankruptcy laws: THE CURRENT LAW Was enacted in 1978 and became effective in 1979. Lets individuals choose between two forms of bankruptcy. The more popular, Chapter 7, lets people discharge unsecured debts, such as medical bills and credit card debt. But they can lose assets that secure debts, like houses or cars. In the other type, Chapter 13, individuals try to pay their debts over three to five years, with protection from their secured creditors. THE NEW LAW Was enacted in April and becomes effective on Oct. 17. Requires filers to provide more documentation. Requires all filers to complete a federally approved credit counseling program. Allows filers to use Chapter 7 only if a means test shows that they earn less than the median for their state, and do not have enough income, after living expenses, to repay at least $6,000 over five years. Requires filers with more resources to file Chapter 13. Gives judges discretion to let higher-income debtors file under Chapter 7, if they have ''special circumstances.''"
"The first results are in on who is set to profit from the Katrina cleanup, and -- surprise -- many of the firms winning major contracts have big political connections. Congressional investigators are already looking into AshBritt, a Pompano Beach, Fla., company with ties to Mississippi's governor, Haley Barbour -- the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. AshBritt has nabbed $568 million in contracts for trash removal. Questions have also been raised about the political connections of two other major contractors: the Shaw Group, and Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton. Both companies have been represented by Joe Allbaugh, President Bush's former campaign manager and the former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- although Mr. Allbaugh says he does not help any of his clients obtain federal contracts. And there's more. An article in yesterday's Times by Eric Lipton and Ron Nixon reports that more than 80 percent of the $1.5 billion in contracts signed by FEMA for Katrina work were awarded without bidding or with limited competition. The Times article even finds a federal employee -- Richard Skinner, the inspector general for the Homeland Security Department -- willing to go on the record with his concern, saying, ''We are very apprehensive about what we are seeing.'' So are we. The government is spending more than a quarter of a billion dollars every day on rescue, relief and reconstruction along the Gulf Coast. Anyone who pays taxes in America should be concerned about how the money is being spent and who is profiting. We think that when Congress appropriates money for disaster relief, the advantage should be maximized for the victims, not for the same cast of characters that have been profiting from no-bid contracts in Iraq. Kellogg, Brown & Root, Americans may recall, is the company that came up with those $100-per-bag laundry bills for work in Iraq. All of this comes back to cronyism. The resignation of the FEMA chief, Michael Brown, was only one of the recent departures. The head of federal procurement policy at the Office of Management and Budget resigned just before he was arrested on charges of lying to federal investigators, and the Pentagon's former inspector general has left for the private sector but remains the target of a Congressional inquiry. Last week, the Homeland Security Department appointed the National Weather Service's chief financial officer, Matthew Jadacki, to head a new Office for Hurricane Katrina Oversight. That's a step in the right direction. The office itself is a good idea, and Mr. Jadacki's experience is a welcome contrast with that of many of the inexperienced political appointees who have been exposed by this crisis. But the administration will have to go a lot further if it wants any chance of regaining the American people's trust, which it has so squandered. The true test of the new oversight office will be in its financing and staffing. America doesn't need a public relations stunt; it needs a functioning means of curbing abuse. A promising legislative initiative comes from Senators Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, and Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois. They have called for a chief financial officer to review expenditures before the money is spent, rather than more inspectors general to audit records after the fact. That strikes us as a fine idea. Editorial"
"The lights came back on in the French Quarter on Monday, and residents streamed back across the Mississippi River to neighborhoods in Algiers. For the first time since Hurricane Rita compounded the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, glimmers of optimism began coursing through this battered and largely deserted city as Gulf Coast residents in Texas and Louisiana tried to put their lives back together. The death toll from Hurricane Rita rose to eight on Monday. Five people were found dead in an apartment in Beaumont, Tex., apparently overcome by carbon monoxide from a generator they had been using indoors to power a ceiling fan, the authorities said. A 3-year-old boy in Point Blank, Tex., was killed when a tree fell on his family's mobile home. Residents of southwestern Louisiana were trying to return to the hard-hit towns where the storm obliterated homes, businesses and farms. Crude oil and gasoline futures rebounded on speculation that refineries near the Texas-Louisiana border might be offline longer than expected. Officials said refineries in Beaumont and Port Arthur, Tex., had suffered more damage than originally thought and could be closed for extended periods, Bloomberg News reported. None of the refinery operators said when production would resume. But under a sunny sky on a day with sweltering heat, residents across the region tried to move on after the storms. Houston, which had feared a knockout blow from Hurricane Rita but received just a wet slap, continued to recover, with power restored to about 555,000 of the 700,000 CenterPoint Energy customers who lost service on Saturday. Paul Bettencourt, the tax assessor and collector for Harris County, which includes Houston, estimated that the county had suffered $41.6 million in damages, a fraction of the loss of $50 billion to $80 billion that had been expected if Hurricane Rita had remained a Category 5 storm and hit Houston head-on instead of veering off to the east. With evacuees streaming back to Houston, there were some traffic jams on southbound Interstate 45, but little of the gridlock that marred the mass evacuation on Thursday and Friday. Motorists appeared, for the most part, to be abiding by a staggered plan that designated different return dates for various sections of the city. In New Orleans, Mayor C. Ray Nagin resumed plans to reopen the city gradually, inviting people in the Algiers section to return on Monday. Business owners in other parts of the city, particularly the French Quarter, were also allowed back. But officials made clear that residents would not be coming back to the city they knew. ''We want people to return and help us rebuild the city,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''However, we want everyone to assess the risks and make an informed decision about re-entry plans.'' An information sheet handed to returning residents said, ''Welcome home!'' But it also warned, ''You are entering the City of New Orleans at your own risk.'' It added, ''There are still many health and safety issues.'' In Algiers, an area with 60,000 residents before Hurricane Katrina struck, business owners and residents were allowed to start returning at 10 a.m. for inspections. Many stores had opened by then, and plenty of residents were returning. Hulon Matherne put plywood signs by the road to point the way to his barbershop. He had an electric razor in his right hand and a pistol in his belt. He was giving a $12 haircut to Davis Mena, 4, and Pat Cargol was next in line. The other chairs had been stolen after the storm, and the other barber had quit to make quick money in construction. ''We're going to survive,'' Mr. Matherne said. ''Those that want to work will survive. That's why I busted my buns to get back here.'' In the French Quarter, business operators became giddy when the power came back on around 11 a.m. on Monday. Within an hour, bartenders had rushed into the Bourbon Street Blues Company and the Famous Door. ''We're happy to be back, and we ain't going nowhere,'' said Phil Uson, the owner of both establishments. ''People have heard New Orleans is done, we're closed, we're not coming back. That's so far from the truth.'' Mr. Uson predicted that his clubs would be ''seminormal.'' ''Mardi Gras will be the start of everything again,'' he said. Stephen Perry, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that all major conventions, the lifeblood of the tourist economy, had been canceled through March 31, when the convention center is expected to reopen after being repaired and refurbished. The center was the scene of widespread despair immediately after the flood, serving as a gathering place for thousands of hungry and homeless residents. Mr. Perry said 80 percent of the city's hotels could be back in operation by the end of October, and 90 percent to 95 percent by Christmas. Tourism, the city's largest industry with 85,000 jobs, will begin to recover near the end of the year, he said, first through rescue workers and contractors, then through individual visitors and small meetings and conventions, and finally with the major events. ''The outpouring of emotion and support from around the country has really stunned us,'' Mr. Perry said. ''People know this is a very special place.'' And there were glimmers of that on Monday, like the sight of Scott Boswell, a celebrated local chef, handing out fliers for his newly opened restaurant Stanley (a counterpoint to his well-known Stella!), where he was selling cheeseburgers for $5. The place was full of excited rescue workers and French Quarter residents. Business owners conceded that there would not be enough customers for months for all the businesses that wanted to reopen, but they said everyone was eager to return, to show that they could and to keep their employees. ''I've told everyone, New Orleans is a feeling, it's a disease,'' said Jim Monaghan, owner of Molly's at the Market, which reopened hours after Hurricane Katrina passed and was host to a healthy collection of residents and others drinking beer on Monday. ''And once you've got it, it doesn't go away. I guarantee you, we'll help each other out, we'll frequent each others businesses, we'll do what's needed to get us through this.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"Once the water recedes, mud is hauled away and families are reunited with those who survived Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, most of the displaced residents will be focused on finding new places to live and work. But it will be equally important to pay attention to the effects of these vast disruptions on the mental health of children whose lives were torn apart. In an almost prophetic coincidence, in the September issue of the journal Pediatrics, experts from the American Academy of Pediatrics published a 10-page report to help pediatricians deal with the psychosocial effects of traumatic events -- natural disasters and acts of terrorism -- on children of all ages. The report, by the academy's Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health, and its Task Force on Terrorism, was compiled in response to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But it could not have come out at a more appropriate time. Dr. Joseph F. Hagan Jr., a pediatrician in Burlington, Vt., headed both the committee and the task force. In his view, the job ahead is similar to that faced by those trying to address the needs of children after Sept. 11, even though the catastrophes resulted from an act of nature, not a deliberate act of terrorism, and there are many child survivors to care for. 'Profound Sadness' ''The children will have post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, and some will have bereavement issues,'' Dr. Hagan said in an interview. ''They've lost their homes, neighbors, pets, friends and some have lost parents and grandparents -- all factors that can lead to profound sadness.'' At the same time, parents whose lives were affected may themselves experience emotional problems that can make it difficult for them to recognize and cope with the mental health needs of their children. ''If a parent has a sense of hopelessness, that parent's ability to attend to a child's needs is compromised,'' Dr. Hagan noted. And parents who will have to find a new life for themselves and their families ''are not as likely to be available to their children and sensitive to their needs,'' he said. The report states: ''Any effect of trauma on key or trusted adults can result in magnified psychological effect on the children they care for. An adult's emotional problems can add to a child's fear. Distressed adults may fail to recognize a child's distress.'' Under these circumstances, he said, ''We wouldn't want parents to have to figure it out. It's the role of communities, family doctors, pediatricians and schools to anticipate the mental health needs of children,'' he explained. And they must prepare to deal with these needs, he said. ''We lack a cohesive health care system in this country, particularly with regard to mental health,'' Dr. Hagan said. ''We have inadequate mental health services for children, and it's much harder for children to access these services than it is for adults.'' Dr. Hagan said the first task was to get shelter for families and the second was to get parents jobs so they could have some sense of autonomy and control over their lives. ''This is important to a child's sense of safety,'' he said. ''If parents are frantic because of their own losses and needs, it's pretty hard for children to be protected.'' Equally important is to get children in school as quickly as possible. ''School is what's supposed to happen in September,'' Dr. Hagan noted, and returning to school restores a sense of normalcy for children. Even in the best of circumstances, children who have been the victims of devastating natural disasters like the back-to-back hurricanes are likely to experience emotional distress that can affect their behavior and mood for months to come. ''Parents and caregivers can expect children to respond to disaster in distinct stages,'' the report states. ''The first stage, immediately after the disaster, includes reactions of fright, disbelief, denial, grief, and feelings of relief if loved ones have not been harmed.'' The second stage comes a few days to several weeks after the disaster. It might include regression to an earlier stage of development, anxiety, fear, sadness and depression, hostility and aggression toward others, apathy, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, psychosomatic symptoms like stomachaches, a pessimistic view of the future and play acting that recreates aspects of the event. Children with marked distress are in urgent need of counseling, the report notes. Professional help is also needed for children with stress reactions that persist for longer than a month, or who are at risk for developing a persistent post-traumatic reaction or ''violent or delinquent behaviors later in life,'' the report notes. Even infants and toddlers can be adversely affected by disasters. For infants, the reaction can be an increase in crying and irritability, separation anxiety and an exaggerated startle response. For toddlers and preschoolers, signs of trouble may include sleep terrors and nightmares, helplessness, clinging behavior and temper tantrums. School-age children may re-enact the trauma in play, behave aggressively, become withdrawn or apathetic, develop psychosomatic symptoms or behavior problems, and experience sleep disturbances and regressive behaviors like separation anxiety. Traumatized children may become hypervigilant, always on the alert for possible danger, Dr. Hagan said. They may be afraid to go to go to sleep or to school lest they get washed away while their mothers are somewhere else. Even young children distant from the trauma can be adversely affected, thinking a hurricane will next hit where they live, Dr. Hagan said. ''They need to be reassured that Katrina was far, far away.'' Exceptionally Vulnerable Adolescents, who are already going through a difficult period of development, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of a disaster, the report states. They may become withdrawn, apathetic and depressed. They may also engage in risk-taking behaviors like drug abuse and sexual behaviors as a means of coping with trauma-induced distress. On the other hand, some adolescents may try to mask or withhold symptoms of distress and even try to protect other family members who are upset. As a result, parents may underestimate the effects of the disaster on adolescents and fail to get them the help they need. The report also points out that boys and girls tend to react differently to a disaster. Girls commonly develop symptoms like anxiety and mood disturbances, while boys are more likely to show behavioral symptoms and take longer to recover than girls. Most important, the report concludes, is to ''allow our children to have hope.'' ''Even children living in unsafe communities or those affected by prejudice, racism, or violence depend on trusted adults to feel safe or protected so that they might anticipate a less stress-laden future,'' it says. Achieving this goal will depend on the actions taken in the coming weeks by federal, state and community governments, schools and health care professionals, not just by parents who themselves have been traumatized. PERSONAL HEALTH"
"President Bush said Monday that he and Congress should immediately begin discussing whether to amend federal law so the military could take responsibility right away in natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. While Mr. Bush had raised the idea before, his comments, at an appearance at the Energy Department, were his first explicit remarks about changing the 127-year-old law that restricts the role of federal troops when they act on American soil. His proposal would also appear to take considerable responsibility away from the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the department. ''I don't want to prejudge the Congress's discussion on this issue because it may require change of law,'' Mr. Bush said, apparently referring to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, written in response to the huge federal military presence in the South during Reconstruction. It prohibits the military from engaging in law enforcement, but many exceptions have been carved out. Many Pentagon officials have expressed concern about broadening the military's responsibilities to include what would, in effect, be police work, along with its combat role. They argue that it would require very different training, equipment and force levels. Earlier this month, Paul McHale, the assistant secretary of defense for homeland security, said in an interview about the military's response to Hurricane Katrina that ''what we ought not do is convert D.O.D. into a department of first responders.'' Mr. Bush, however, appears to be moving in exactly that direction. He discussed the concept in a speech 11 days ago in New Orleans, and brought it up again over the weekend in a visit to the United States Northern Command in Colorado Springs, which was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to coordinate defense of the United States. On Monday, Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that ''once the president's views are developed into a specific proposal, our committee will review it promptly.'' Mr. Bush said Monday at the Energy Department that he wanted to think about ''a scenario which would require federal assets to stabilize the situation, primarily D.O.D. assets, and then hand back over to the Department of Homeland Security, for example.'' At a news briefing later, Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said the administration was looking at ''automatic triggers'' that could start that federal response. It was not clear how those triggers would work, or if the president would have to sign off on the mobilization, as he does when National Guard troops are federalized. An approaching Category 5 hurricane could constitute one of those triggers, but a warning would be unlikely for a calamitous earthquake. (In the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, federal forces acted without any authority from Washington.) Mr. McClellan noted that ''a governor can request us to take certain steps, or the president has the authority to take steps he deems necessary.'' But with some kind of automatic trigger, he said, ''it wouldn't be necessary to get a request from the governor or take other action.'' Mr. McClellan was making an oblique reference to the conversations between Mr. Bush and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana before Hurricane Katrina. Some administration officials have argued that Governor Blanco never explicitly asked for federal help. Her aides have said she did not know that federal officials wanted itemized requests for help and not just a general request. Some experts said Monday that under existing law, Mr. Bush had all the authority required. ''There are all kinds of exceptions to Posse Comitatus that allow the federal government to do what they should have before Katrina,'' said William C. Banks, a professor at Syracuse University Law School and an authority on Posse Comitatus. Mr. Bush could have acted ''on the governor's request, or on presidential initiative,'' Professor Banks said. He said Mr. Bush's authority extended to using the troops to stop looting -- a law enforcement function -- under provisions that enable him to put down any act of insurrection. ''The restrictions everyone's talking about are more cultural than legal,'' the professor said. In fact, Mr. Bush was far more proactive in the use of federal troops as Hurricane Rita approached at the end of last week, and he spent Friday night at the Northern Command headquarters. On Capitol Hill, disagreement among Republicans over how to pay for hurricane recovery stalled action on a health care measure whose estimated cost is at least $7 billion. The legislation would make it easier for evacuees to be treated through the Medicaid program and would help states pay for the health care costs of people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Also on Monday, an official of the Federal Emergency Management Agency confirmed that the agency had hired Michael D. Brown, the former agency director who resigned under fire on Sept. 12, as a contractor to aid in his successor's transition. The FEMA official said the contracting arrangement had been in place from the time that Mr. Brown announced his resignation and would last two more weeks. STORM AND CRISIS: FEDERAL RESPONSE"
"A month ago, Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist who has spent decades studying how hurricanes reach their peak strength, ''had this terrible feeling of dread'' when he saw that Hurricane Katrina's track in the Gulf of Mexico would carry it right over an oceanographic phenomenon known as the loop current. Late Friday, Dr. Emanuel, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, felt the same dread when it seemed as if Hurricane Rita, fueled by the same current, was going to pass over a related warm eddy and grow even stronger. To his relief, Rita did not, and that is one reason the storm weakened substantially before coming ashore. In this stormy season, Dr. Emanuel and other storm experts have been fixated on the loop current, a great ribbon of hot water meandering through the Gulf of Mexico. For a long time it has been little more than an oceanographic curiosity but, because of its role in energizing storms, it is now a centerpiece of hurricane forecasts. The current is a conveyor belt of banked solar energy, typically with more than 100 times the flow of the Amazon. It gained notoriety after providing the fuel that helped transform Hurricanes Rita and Katrina from nondescript tropical storms into a rare single-season pair of Category 5 monsters. In past decades, the current and swirling rings of warm water that it casts off have been tracked mainly for fishing fleets seeking the tuna and swordfish that congregate nearby, and oil companies worried that the roiling currents could rip their drill rigs out of the seabed. Now, scientists are using satellites, buoys and air-dropped probes to study its ability to transform a nascent hurricane from a ragged pinwheel of rain and highway-speed winds into ''a tornado the size of Georgia,'' as one Weather Channel meteorologist described Hurricane Rita late last week. All other things being equal, its presence or absence appears to be essential for a hurricane in the region to achieve the rare state of the superstorm -- one reaching the physical limits of power and size possible in earth's atmosphere. Consequently ''loop current'' has become a familiar phrase on news broadcasts about this season's remarkable storms. ''It has everyone's attention now,'' said Kenneth J. Schaudt, a private oceanographer and meteorologist in Katy, Tex., who tracks the warm, deep waters for the oil and fishing industries and had to evacuate on Friday when it looked as if Rita was going to pass directly over his home. Dr. Schaudt first became aware of the loop current's potential to nourish hurricanes in 1985, when he helped run a research project in which a small research vessel, the Pelican, was probing one of the warm eddies spun off by the loop south of Louisiana. ''As the boat surveyed the eddy, Hurricane Juan formed up essentially over the boat,'' he said. The crew members ended up having to lash themselves to the boat to avoid be swept away, he said. The current carries warm water from the Caribbean Sea around the western horn of Cuba into the cul-de-sac of the gulf. Finding no outlet, it generally curls up toward Louisiana and then exits between Florida and Cuba, turning north parallel to the Eastern Seaboard and helping to form the appropriately named Gulf Stream. Hurricanes feed on the energy from warm water. But while the gulf is often uniformly hot at the surface, that layer is so thin that it offers limited energy to hurricanes, which can stifle themselves as they churn along and draw up cooler waters from below. But when such a storm passes over the loop current or one of its eddies, the water can be 79 degrees as much as 300 feet deep, meaning that no matter how much a passing hurricane stirs things up, it never exhausts its fuel supply. The eddies can break into even smaller whorls of warm deep water that can drift independently in the gulf for months before dissipating. Oceanographers who monitor all of this for the oil and gas industry have taken to naming the spinning, circular currents. The one that nurtured Hurricane Juan was Fast Eddy. Other eddies have been called Murphy and Nelson. (A list of eddies is online: www.horizonmarine.com/namedlces.html.) Satellite sensors that can measure the elevation of the ocean surface to within an inch have allowed scientists to map the general location of the current by exploiting the fact that water expands when warm and thus lumps up where it's warm beneath the surface. There is so much heat banked in the depths of the loop current that the sea surface bulges as much as half a yard, said Gustavo Jorge Goni, an oceanographer at the Commerce Department's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami. Together with Joaquin Triñanes of the University of Miami, Dr. Goni has been using satellite data to generate global maps of what is called ''tropical cyclone heat potential,'' essentially a mix of measurements that describes how much energy a particular patch of ocean can provide to a passing hurricane. To become a catastrophic storm, a hurricane needs a host of conditions to be met. There must be no shear in the atmosphere, no disconnect between the speeds of successively higher layers of air, a condition that can dismantle an expanding storm before it organizes into the trademark bull's-eye of a potent cyclone. The storm must encounter no pools of dry air. Hurricanes thrive only when there is moisture in the atmosphere, drawn from the sea. And it must have an unclogged exhaust pipe, with cold air aloft allowing the hot, moist air to vault skyward. Even if all these conditions are met, though, it now seems clear that a perfectly forming storm must have no energy limits in the ocean below. There are seven regions where oceanic hot spots are big enough and deep enough to allow hurricanes to reach their peak, Dr. Goni said, including several places south of Japan and east of Indonesia. Along the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, the source of energy for major storms is the great flow of waters generated in the Caribbean."
"A new threat to the battered Gulf Coast emerged on Monday as Tropical Storm Rita approached the Florida Keys, prompting evacuations in Key West and other coastal towns as residents of Texas and Louisiana warily tracked the storm's progress. Forecasters say that if the storm, which is expected to reach hurricane force by Tuesday morning, follows its predicted course, it will strike west of New Orleans -- somewhere in southwest Louisiana or along the Texas coast -- as early as Friday evening. But even if it does miss New Orleans, its accompanying rainstorms, even if they amount to only a few inches, could cause significant flooding in a city where some neighborhoods have never dried out and the levees have not been fully repaired, officials said. The National Weather Service forecasts that Rita will produce 4 to 6 inches of rain over a widespread area, and as much as 15 inches in parts of Cuba and the Florida Keys, which are under an evacuation order. The storm is expected to strengthen once it crosses into the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes draw strength from warm surface water, so it is not unusual for a relatively weak Atlantic storm to roar to life as it crosses the warmer Gulf, where water temperatures have been unusually high all summer, said Abby Sallenger of the United States Geological Survey. This happened just over three weeks ago, when Hurricane Katrina, then a Category 1 storm, cut through southern Florida and strengthened to a Category 5 in the gulf. As Tropical Storm Rita approached the Florida Keys on Monday with sustained winds of about 70 miles an hour, emergency officials ordered partial evacuations as far north as Broward County, even though the mainland was not expected to bear the storm's brunt. About 40,000 residents of the lower Keys were ordered to evacuate, and the normally carefree spirit of Key West was strikingly subdued. ''We went to bed Friday not worrying about this and woke up Sunday worrying about it,'' said Raymond Archer, the port director in Key West, whose family has lived there for generations. ''This is fresh and real in people's minds.'' Mayor Jimmy Weekley spent the day urging even stubborn long-timers to leave, and thousands of cars chugged north on Route 1. ''I still have people coming up to me and saying they are staying,'' said Mr. Weekley. ''I'm telling them to re-think their position.'' Texas, which provided major sanctuary to victims of Hurricane Katrina, went on heightened alert Monday. The island city of Galveston, which was all but obliterated in a hurricane 105 years ago that claimed up to 12,000 lives, activated its emergency management plan. Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said that if the storm continued on its projected course, she would order a voluntary evacuation to begin at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Those without cars will be offered space on 88 school buses to four Red Cross shelters in Huntsville, Tex. Nearly 1,200 members of the Texas National Guard have been recalled from relief operations in Louisiana for return to their home bases. In Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said coastal residents in the southwest should prepare to evacuate now. ''Even if it doesn't strike the Louisiana coast directly, I want to remind our citizens that we are on the east side of the hurricane,'' Governor Blanco said. ''We are still in a very dangerous place.'' Mark Smith, spokesman for the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency, said that if the hurricane shifted closer to New Orleans, devastating flooding could follow. ''If there's another event, we're concerned the levees that are being repaired would fail,'' Mr. Smith said. STORM AND CRISIS: WEATHER"
"People think of the landscapes they inhabit as terra firma, solid ground. Usually they are right, in that natural processes like the flow of a river alter the land so slowly that their effects emerge only in thousands or even millions of years -- ''geological time,'' as scientists call it. But storms like hurricanes run these processes in a matter of hours, destroying beaches and punching inlets through barrier islands. Winds, waves and surges of water pick up sand and move it inland. This process can help islands survive the rising sea levels of global warming. Undeveloped islands ordinarily regain their shape and plant life within a few years, though they may have been shifted slightly inland, toward higher ground. When islands are developed, though, the effects of this natural process can be extreme, as is visible in these images of Dauphin Island, Ala., made by scientists at the United States Geological Survey. The scientists used an airborne, radar-like system called lidar that measures topography in great detail. The image at top left is of a stretch of the island before Hurricane Ivan struck the Gulf Coast a year ago. The island's main road, Bienville Boulevard, runs down the center of the island, the Gulf of Mexico is on the left and there are several rows of houses in between. The center image shows the island after Hurricane Ivan passed. The storm has removed some sand from the Gulf beach and deposited on the road, covering it. After Hurricane Katrina, as the image at right shows, the storm has pushed sand over the island and into the sound behind it, a phenomenon geologists call rollover. In the image at the bottom, made by comparing pre- and post-Katrina lidar measurements, light pink areas show where sand has been swept away and light green shows where it has been deposited behind the island in formations geologists call overwash fans. (The dark pink spots are vanished houses and dark green spots are houses built after Ivan that survived or houses picked up and moved by the storm.) Scientists search images like these for clues to why some structures survived while others failed, in the hope that they will be able to predict a storm's damage potential as well as its speed and strength. Usually, they start making observations as quickly as they can after a storm passes, before waves and tides and winds start smoothing over the storm's tracks. They could not do that with Hurricane Katrina. The damage was too severe and the disruption was too widespread. But scientists say the storm's strength means its signatures will remain on the land for a while. The changes on Dauphin Island are especially striking given that Hurricane Katrina came ashore relatively far away, at Gulfport, Miss., said Abby Sallenger, a scientist who is leading the USGS imaging efforts. ''There's a lesson, I think, in the resulting destruction of homes,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''It's happened here before, during Hurricane Frederick in 1979, and again in Hurricane Elena in 1985. I hate to think that someday we'll be back, flying over the same kind of destruction yet again.''"
"Newspapers and television stations, as many people know, have been losing readers and viewers for years. But in New Orleans over the last two weeks, when news was precious, the local media's customer base -- and its advertisers -- literally vanished, exiled from home in a vast diaspora beyond the reach of telemarketers and ad salesmen. New Orleans media outlets, including The Times-Picayune and seven television stations making up the nation's 43rd-largest media market, have been left to contemplate a surreal future of unknown duration in a city devoid of functioning businesses, with no goods to advertise and almost no people to buy them. As a plaintive Times-Picayune headline put it Friday, ''Few Souls Remain in Shell of a City.'' And yet the owners of The Times-Picayune, which had a circulation around 270,000 before Hurricane Katrina struck, and the seven television stations, which served about 670,000 households, were unflinching in their commitment to the deluged city -- making plain the difference between the manufacturers of widgets and the gatherers of news. ''We're in this for the long haul,'' said Terry Mackin, executive vice president of Hearst-Argyle Television, owner of WDSU-TV, the NBC-affiliated station in New Orleans. Jeff Reiter, a spokesman for the Tribune Company, which owns WGNO-TV, the ABC-affiliated station, said, ''We are definitely committed to remaining in this market.'' And Donald E. Newhouse, president of Advance Publications, which owns the daily newspaper, said: ''To use the words of our publisher, Ashton Phelps Jr., The Times-Picayune will continue to publish. Period. And we will continue to own The Times-Picayune. Period.'' For the media outlets of New Orleans, the short-term issue has been to find a way to publish and distribute, to get on the air and stay on the air, while simultaneously covering and being caught up in what may be the biggest natural disaster in the nation's history. The extent of the physical damage to their plants and stations is unclear. Most have been dislocated and their staff members are working out of temporary newsrooms and studios around the region, barred by flood damage and a lack of electricity from getting back to their desks. The chaos of the short term has obscured the abyss of the long term, which is only beginning to emerge. As the news media outlets continue to produce, who will be reading them? Who will be watching them? And who will be paying for the substantial additional costs of gathering news during the crisis, which, for television stations, include expenses like renting helicopters? The Times-Picayune took in an average of $9.2 million a month in ad revenue over the last six months, according to TNS Media Intelligence, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres, which tracks advertising spending. It has obviously lost some revenue, but it is hard at this point to say how much. Insurance companies, banks and area employers have been advertising in increasing numbers. But the newspaper has been able to print only two sections of eight pages each a day, although Jim Amoss, the editor, said he hoped to go to 20 pages. Before the hurricane, the paper ran an average of 80 pages a day. The television stations, which collectively took in an average of $7.5 million a month over the last six months, have probably lost a combined $3.7 million in the last two weeks. The question is how long these outlets, which earn the vast majority of their revenue from advertising, can go without that revenue. New Orleans is looking at months if not years of recovery. ''They have to think of themselves in the short term as operating as public interest entities rather than as commercial entities,'' said Jon Swallen, director of research at TNS. ''But it still costs money to print your paper or broadcast your television programs, and where is that money going to come from? It's up to the corporate owners to decide how to proceed for how long and at what cost.'' Such decisions hinge largely on when the city may become commercially viable again. ''That's a total unknown,'' said David Barrett, the president of Hearst-Argyle. ''Anyone who would suggest they knew the answer to that would be crazy. No one can even hazard a guess.'' But Mr. Barrett did hazard a guess as to how long the television stations might operate before advertisers started to return. ''I expect we'll go four weeks or longer with no revenue at the station,'' he said. ''But we still have to meet the role of local broadcasters. We've been doing great local journalism, and we'll continue to. That's what a big broadcast company can do.'' The closest analogy for how advertisers can approach the New Orleans market may be World War II, when there was virtually no production of consumer goods like cars and appliances as factories were retooled for military purposes. Many marketers continued to advertise, running patriotic pitches to stimulate sales of war bonds or offering uplifting vistas of a rosy postwar life. One of the most famous ad campaigns emerged from the 1940's when the Ford Motor Company adopted the forward-looking slogan, ''There's a Ford in your future.'' The only cars in the ads were drawings, inside an illustration of a crystal ball, implicitly giving people hope that peace and prosperity lay ahead. Sue Johenning, executive vice president and director for local broadcasting at the Initiative media agency in Los Angeles, said surveys the agency conducted after Sept. 11, 2001, showed that at some point consumers want ''a return to normalcy, and they see advertising as part of returning to normalcy.'' She said the surveys also showed ''advertisers that provided information and service were looked to favorably.'' But New Orleans is too absorbed in the here and now to begin to think about normalcy. ''It's cavalier to do anything in the region unless it's about helping people,'' said Richard Kirshenbaum, co-chairman of a division of the MDC Corporation, Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, which operates agencies handling tasks including advertising, media buying and public relations. ''There's a level of appropriateness people ought to follow when the disaster is still in place,'' he said, likening the situation to the aftermath of 9/11 in the New York region when consumers felt that what they were going through was ''too devastating'' for anything overtly commercial. Mary Gerzema, executive vice president and communications planning director at Universal McCann in New York, said advertisers needed to avoid anything that seemed ''opportunistic or callous,'' but that did not mean all advertising should cease. ''The key is having something to say that people appreciate hearing and find useful,'' she said. For instance, for the Lowe's home-improvement chain, she said, the agency bought commercial time on radio stations or replaced already scheduled spots with new ones discussing how its stores had frozen prices, ordered extra shipments of needed merchandise and made donations to the Red Cross. Ads in The Times-Picayune have been of a plain, public service nature, with no pictures. The Whitney Bank was one of the first to start advertising again, and its ads have evolved in a span of just a few days. The first ads were titled ''Times Like These Call for a Bank Like the Whitney.'' Its ad in yesterday's paper announced a broad-based hurricane assistance loan for storm victims. The paper is also seeing a new type of ad appealing to displaced persons.Kleinpeter Farms Dairy of Baton Rouge, La., for example, took out space in the paper to say, ''We welcome you, our new neighbors from New Orleans, and if you haven't already done so, we invite you to try our milk.'' While advertisers are taking things a day at a time, media owners appear to be basing their determination to stay in New Orleans largely on the pending arrival of billions of dollars in reconstruction aid. Executives from both Hearst and the Belo Corporation, which owns the CBS affiliate WWL-TV, said they expected the New Orleans market to rebound because reconstruction companies would want to advertise their services on local television. . ''People are going to need rebuilding,'' said Rick Keilty, senior vice president of Belo, ''and if you are in a business that provides that rebuilding, you are going to want to tell people you can provide those services.'' Mr. Mackin of Hearst-Argyle went so far as to predict an economic boom for stations in New Orleans. ''I think we'll see a short-term economic hit and then a long-term boom,'' he said, citing the billions in government dollars designated for the city. He said conventional local advertisers, like auto dealers and fast-food restaurants, would be in a position to reap the benefits of federal and charitable dollars -- at least that was the experience in places like Orlando and West Palm Beach, Fla., last year in the wake of hurricane damage. But the short term, all the executives conceded, is a total loss. ''I think it's a fair statement to say the advertising base has been wrecked,'' Mr. Keilty said. ''We're in the process of strategizing how we'll deal with that now.'' WWL-TV, the market leader, is the only station that never left the air in New Orleans throughout the crisis, running continuous commercial-free news coverage of the storm and its aftermath. WWL is one of the nation's dominant local stations and is CBS's strongest affiliate in terms of market share for its local news programs, though it is impossible to say how many people are watching it now because without commercials, the stations are not being rated. But many of WWL's viewers have been relocated well outside the range of the station's broadcast signal, or the local cable systems that routinely carry it. In those cases, New Orleans residents have turned to the Internet for information. Mr. Keilty said some of WWL's advertisers had already been accommodated with space on the station's Web site, which has been streaming coverage of news developments. He said that one day last week, the site had more than 10.5 million page views. ''We're going to be looking more and more to the Web site for advertising revenue,'' he said. Similarly, The Times-Picayune established a milestone of sorts by producing its newspaper in a Web version only for three days after the flooding began. On Friday, Sept. 2, it resumed publishing a print version as well, with 50,000 papers at first, then 60,000. But with its regular readers scattered and with intense worldwide interest in New Orleans, the paper's Web site (nola.com) is poised to become increasingly dominant. It offers not just news but also a missing-persons database and details about neighborhoods from local residents. It is experiencing a heady increase in traffic. Peter Weinberger, president of Advance Internet, said the paper was getting 26 million page views a day -- just about the same number it had been getting a month in the period before the hurricane. And the number of advertisers, who receive prominent display on the Web, continues to climb. Mr. Amoss, the editor, said yesterday that the news-to-advertising ratio was now a ''very healthy'' 50-50 with several full-page ads, many of them in color."
"When he introduced the band Green Day on Saturday night, Jon Stewart proved there was something to the idea that he could set aside the satire and become a type of father figure, a solid, unmovable anchor for a televised medium awash in storm metaphors. Few have thought that Mr. Stewart, the host of Comedy Central's ''Daily Show,'' could really contribute to a serious discussion without a wink and a punch line. But on Saturday he was plausibly profound: ''The help that we have seen is way more powerful than this hurricane was.'' Mr. Stewart was presiding, along with others, over the MTV Networks' simulcast telethon for hurricane relief, and he saluted the power of ''songs transcending generational and ethnic boundaries.'' Later, he told his audience to pledge money or support of any kind: ''You've never been more needed than you are tonight.'' For years, Mr. Stewart has occupied the strange zone between politics and pop culture. He eschews any agenda, insisting that the ''fake news'' format of ''The Daily Show'' is not a reliable source, even though it is; that he is merely playing off the headlines for laugh lines, even though he isn't. Honestly, there wasn't enough of Mr. Stewart's guidance in the proceedings over the weekend, as performers struggled to make their points while minding their manners. He appeared in just one of the four separate telethons held since the hurricane (one was 10 days ago), events that together have raised easily tens of millions of dollars, though the final tally is pending. The productions complemented the endless images of displacement with songs of consolation and regret. Love songs suddenly gained new resonance, becoming public arias about mercy and rescue. ''I will try to fix you,'' Chris Martin sang from a Coldplay concert in New York, which was specially taped for the occasion. ''I will shelter you,'' Kelly Clarkson chimed in from a Los Angeles studio, where she performed Ray LaMontagne's superb song, ''Shelter.'' Rob Thomas delivered Cyndi Lauper's ''If you fall, I will catch you'' refrain. In ''Shelter From the Storm,'' the most widely broadcast -- and tamest -- telethon, carried on all six broadcast networks, Kanye West's microphone didn't work. Was this glitch a result of the amplifier feedback that viewers could already hear in the introduction of his astounding, choir-backed ''Jesus Walks''? Or was this a pre-emptive strike by producers, hedging bets that the man would need to be muted lest he drop some polemic before his first note? Mr. West is getting criticism from all quarters for his impromptu announcement in the telethon carried two Fridays ago on NBC that ''George Bush doesn't care about black people.'' The producer of this past Friday's telethon had told reporters that he had checked in with all the artists to emphasize that their role was to perform, not pontificate. The closest anyone came to breaking this pact was Chris Rock, who sent up the furor by blurting out, ''George Bush hates midgets,'' as soon as he got a chance on the ''Shelter From the Storm'' broadcast. ''Don't forget: George Bush hates albinos,'' he amended later on the BET telethon. All weekend, there was much suspense about how public figures would position themselves in relation to Mr. West's statements. During a superb MTV performance of ''Under the Bridge,'' Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers wore a plain white T-shirt with ''Kanye West'' scrawled in block letters below the collar. To his credit, Mr. West proved in each outing, especially in the Friday night rendition of ''Jesus Walks,'' that he can back up his outspokenness with unmistakable artistry. His dramatic staging of his gospel-tinged hit gave the solemn telethon hours their lone moment of tear-inducing desperation. The rapper, interviewed on Black Entertainment Television in what looked like a green room, answered detractors who have labeled him a publicity hound. Mr. West also described his anguish at seeing the images that the various media chose to disseminate: ''With this, they really tried to make black people seem like animals.'' Steve Harvey, M.C. for the BET telethon, tried to do some unsolicited damage control. ''Sometimes out of hurt and frustration, we say a lot of things, but we love you, brother,'' he said. ''Keep your head up, and we do understand what you were trying to say.'' Mr. Harvey's co-host, Queen Latifah, had a coda to the whole controversy: ''Freedom ain't free, so you're always going to pay to speak what's on your mind and in your heart. It don't mean you shouldn't say it.'' On the MTV telethon, two of the Foo Fighters made a vague accusation of government ''irresponsibility.'' The rapper Ludacris looked as if he was restraining himself as he slowly stated, ''They didn't respond in a timely manner.'' Another rapper, Xzibit, was more descriptive about the emergency response: ''It was slow, lethargic, pathetic.'' Then a white-hatted country singer, Trent Willmon, asked for a cease-fire in the assigning of blame. ''This is a natural disaster,'' he said. ''It's nobody's fault.'' Over at BET, Bill Clinton delved further into partisanship than any on-camera performer. The former president was reached by phone and took up Mr. Harvey's question of what he might have done differently, explaining that his own emergency-services director, James Lee Witt, had had more experience and better organization. ''We always thought faster was better than slower,'' he added. Only the MTV version, with Mr. Stewart setting the most appropriate tone, took enormous risks and offered as many rewards. Unlike during Live 8, there were no commercials, and MTV presented a sweeping modern songbook. Many of the rhythms, it was often noted, had their roots in the Delta. As the MTV telethon stretched past the four-hour mark, including stellar turns by Fiona Apple, Buckwheat Zydeco and Audioslave, the show could be seen to have lasting value: as a teaching tool, as a meditation on American expression, and as a pop-political jazz funeral -- a wake-the-dead march for the whole New Orleans musical scene. It was a tribute that reflected history as much as it tried to shape it. CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"
"WAS Katrina a man-made storm for profits?'' asked Michael Shore, a contributor at the Web site Rense.com, a few days after the hurricane had all but obliterated New Orleans and its environs. ''Just about every human being is totally unaware that technology exists now whereby weather can be used as a weapon of mass destruction.'' It's all part of a ''hideous agenda,'' Mr. Shore wrote, to gain ''total control of planet Earth.'' Of course. It probably shouldn't be surprising that as local, state and federal officials jockey on CNN to cast blame or otherwise spin the storm's ill-handled aftermath, a host of other, more colorful agendas are being burnished at the Internet's fringe -- with Katrina serving as chamois. Last year's tsunami, after all, set Web forums aflutter, attributing the quake not just to Mother Nature, but also to sinister ''eco-weapons'' capable of setting off earthquakes and tsunamis with electromagnetic waves. But in the online post-Katrina theorizing, much darker musings have also emerged. Radical Christian Web sites are celebrating the fire-and-brimstone clobbering of a promiscuous city; anti-abortion groups have mounted spam campaigns that count the clinics now under water; and neo-Nazis have raised virtual fists, having somehow spotted Jews behind Katrina's 150 m.p.h. winds. ''That's the irony of this technological revolution,'' said Abraham H. Foxman, the director of the Anti-Defamation League, which released a report last Thursday tracking racist rants on the Internet in the aftermath of Katrina. ''It helps people around the world to communicate, and for ideas to be shared in ways they couldn't before,'' he said, ''but it also has a dark underbelly.'' And catastrophic events tend to feed that. ''We see it in moments of crisis and moments of trauma,'' Mr. Foxman said. ''What they try to do is link themselves to a legitimate event that people respond to emotionally and intellectually, because otherwise you would never log on to them.'' For some, the hurricane was a Sodomesque comeuppance for a city that brought us Mardi Gras and played backdrop to ''Girls Gone Wild.'' For others, the storm was simply a divine gay-bashing, with numerous Web sites taking it as no coincidence that Katrina landed just two days before the start of Southern Decadence 2005, the annual New Orleans celebration known informally as the Gay Mardi Gras. ''Although the loss of lives is deeply saddening,'' wrote Michael Marcavage at RepentAmerica.com, the Web site for the organization in Philadelphia that he directs, ''this act of God destroyed a wicked city.'' An anonymous blogger at bible3.blogspot.com put the trade-off another way: ''It's like the eggs in the basket,'' he wrote. ''When the basket falls, all the eggs, good or bad, are crashed.'' Mr. Marcavage also noted that ''Louisiana had a total of 10 abortion clinics, with half of them operating in New Orleans'' -- his implication being similar to one made by the group Columbia Christians for Life, which sent out mass e-mail messages comparing the tadpole swirl of clouds in satellite images of Katrina to the chin-tucked profile of a 6-week-old fetus. Photographs were included in the e-mail message to emphasize the point, as was the suggestion that the resemblance was no accident, but rather a divine visual aid sent ''just as God did with a similar satellite picture of Hurricane Ivan in 2004.'' All this has not gone without response from other Christians on the Web. ''Our Creator is not a Murderer'' reads an Internet petition (petitiononline.com/katrina) created by Nathan Nelson, a contributor at Sollicitudo Rei Socialis, a left-leaning Catholic blog. God would not kill thousands of people, the petition insists, ''as punishment for purported sins.'' Links to the petition, which about three dozen people have signed, were carried by the Christian Alliance for Progress (christianalliance.org), which seeks to ''reclaim Christianity'' from the religious right. But elsewhere on the Web, divisiveness thrived. Anti-Semitic groups, for whom Katrina provided evidence that, among other things, ''Israel plans to use the port of New Orleans in order to ship in weapons of mass destruction to use against American citizens'' as one member at Aryan-Nations.org put it. And when Missouri filed suit last week against a network of Web sites that appeared to be collecting donations exclusively for white victims of Katrina, other white supremacist sites simply adjusted their own posthurricane fund-raising. ''Any cash, checks, money orders or goods sent to help with the Kinsmen Rescue Project must be considered gifts, with no strings attached on how the funds are spent,'' advised the proprietors of WhiteRevolution.com. ''If you choose to give, you'll have to rely on our honor as Aryans that the funds are being spent to help our kinfolk in distress.'' Kumbaya. ''We overcame being surprised years ago,'' Mr. Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League said, ''realizing that there's this new world of communication that Goebbels would never have imagined.'' Which makes theories of supersecret electromagnetic earthquake machines seem downright quaint -- or perhaps even plausible? At a conference on terrorism at the University of Georgia in 1997, William S. Cohen, then the secretary of defense, spoke of rogue researchers developing ''an eco-type of terrorism, whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely, through the use of electromagnetic waves.'' Apologies to Mr. Shore, quoted at the beginning of this column. LINK BY LINK"
"''I was in the attic for four days, with no food, water, nothing. Just roaches crawling all over me. And I seen a rat, too. I had to use a board to hold my head above the water, 'cause it was up to my neck. So help me, I thought I was going to die.'' -- Bernice Jones, 64, who finally managed to pry her way out of the attic and was taken by boat to the Superdome. ''They wanted to take my grandmother to Iowa. She's 90 years old and has Alzheimer's. What was she gonna do in Iowa?'' -- Donald McCray, 52, who is looking after his grandmother, Susie Hudson, in a shelter in Gonzales, La. ''A huge percentage of the people who were left behind didn't have a way out. It makes me sick that our plan for them didn't work very well.'' -- Dr. Erin Brewer of Louisiana's Office of Public Health. The stories -- freakish, tragic and sadly true -- continue to come out of New Orleans in an awful, unending rush, like blood from a sudden gaping wound. The stunned survivors have scattered to places like Houston, Dallas, Baton Rouge and here -- Lafayette -- where the Cajundome (yet another sports palace turned homeless shelter) rises like a giant mushroom from the flat, shimmeringly hot parish landscape. JoAnn Kelly, 25, and her sister Nicole, who is 28, were sitting on a low brick ledge outside the Cajundome when I walked up. Each was holding a nervous Chihuahua. ''This is Pebbles,'' said JoAnn. ''That one's Powder. We kept them with us the whole time.'' The two women, who lived in the Magnolia projects in New Orleans, were tired but anxious to tell their story. Like so many others, they thought the worst was over when the winds from Hurricane Katrina subsided and the weather began to clear. ''The sun was out,'' said Nicole. ''But the water started coming right up the street and it kept rising. Then we heard Governor Blanco saying on the radio that they couldn't stop the water and everybody should just get out. ''So we started calling 911, but we couldn't get any help.'' The sick feeling of panic began to rise up in the residents who had stayed in the projects during the hurricane. ''There were helicopters flying by,'' JoAnn said. ''We were up on the fire escape waving white towels, pleading for somebody to help us.'' Eventually a few men from the neighborhood began showing up in stolen boats and trucks. The elderly and small children were the first to be evacuated. JoAnn, Nicole and the dogs were bundled into a milk truck crowded with people. Once again they thought the worst of their ordeal was over, and once again they were wrong. Packed with hot and filthy evacuees (and crates of rapidly souring milk), the truck crossed a bridge from New Orleans to Jefferson Parish, where the desperate occupants were promptly and grotesquely humiliated by several heavily armed plainclothes officers. There were dozens of men, women and children in the truck when it was stopped. They were hungry, thirsty and frightened. It should have been obvious to any sentient being that they were fleeing the flood. Nevertheless, said Nicole, they were ordered out of the truck at gunpoint, with their hands up. One young man was thrown to the ground. The others were ordered to get on the ground, face down. The occupants of the milk truck were black, and they were in dire need of assistance. But in the midst of one of the greatest emergencies in the nation's history, the opportunity to gratuitously humiliate them proved irresistible. ''They laid us out on the ground,'' said JoAnn. Her voice quivered and tears began to leak down her face. ''I was pleading. I was saying, 'Sir, please -- -- ' And then we all went to praying. Crying and praying.''' ''We were all praying,'' said Nicole, ''because we were afraid, the way they were acting, that they would shoot us.'' Eventually, the officers let the group go. No one was charged with any crime. ''They even helped us start the milk truck,'' Nicole said. ''The last thing they told us was, 'Y'all get on out of here. And don't come back.''' The milk truck made its way west on Route 10, and the homeless, bedraggled occupants ultimately were directed to the Cajundome, where, according to JoAnn and Nicole, the officials and volunteers couldn't have been more gracious and helpful.

"Scores of bulletin boards aimed at finding missing persons have popped up on the Internet since Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, and two companies have built specialized search engines to help scour them. Lycos, the 10-year-old search company based in Waltham, Mass., searches at least 20 bulletin boards and missing persons Web sites every four hours to capture data for its service (lycos.com/katrina), while Yahoo retrieves information every hour from 15 large sites and many smaller ones for its engine (news.yahoo.com/katrinahelp). Engineers for Lycos said they started the site Aug. 31 after noticing the proliferation of places for posting such information. Users initially had to go to each site and conduct a separate search, said Steve Quince, a director of engineering for Lycos. ''We're not so much trying to solve the fragmentation as we are trying to accommodate it,'' he said. Both search engines comb the Family News Network of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Nola.com (the Web site affiliated with The Times-Picayune, a New Orleans newspaper), Craigslist and the Katrina Safe List by the Cable News Network. Yahoo also scours its own bulletin boards dedicated to cities affected by the hurricane, universities and relief centers. The online boards started with desperate posts for rescues and medicine drops. But they continue to be inundated with queries from people trying to reconnect with family members -- and pets -- after being evacuated to other cities. ''This is not just about finding the missing or deceased,'' Mr. Quince said. ''It's about families trying to figure out where their families went.'' LISA GUERNSEY MEDIA TALK"
"The CNN anchor Anderson Cooper strikes a pose in the September issue of the men's magazine Maxim, modeling a sharp black suit set off by his prematurely gray hair. A stylized jumble of broken television sets is piled high beside him. It is a very different Mr. Cooper who has captivated CNN viewers in the two weeks since Hurricane Katrina crashed ashore. The jumble of broken stuff is there, but it is real remnants of homes and lives washed away. Mr. Cooper's heart-on-his-sleeve demeanor has been anything but slick and packaged. The 38-year-old anchor has dressed down officials in interviews with polite righteous indignation in behalf of hurricane victims. At least twice he choked up on air, once abruptly stopping his commentary about lost homes and waving away the camera as he looked about to burst into tears. CNN's camera occasionally has caught him playing with stray dogs. He says he has no intention of returning to his hip New York existence any time soon. ''Life is funny like that,'' Mr. Cooper said of the fashion spreads (he is also in Esquire this month) as he took a break on Friday in Baton Rouge, La. Mr. Cooper's Sept. 1 interview with Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, marked a turning point in the tone of hurricane coverage as he snapped when she began thanking federal officials for their recovery efforts. ''Excuse me, Senator, I'm sorry for interrupting,'' Mr. Cooper interjected. ''I haven't heard that, because, for the last four days, I've been seeing dead bodies in the streets here in Mississippi. And to listen to politicians thanking each other and complimenting each other, you know, I got to tell you, there are a lot of people here who are very upset, and very angry, and very frustrated. ''And when they hear politicians slap -- you know, thanking one another, it just, you know, it kind of cuts them the wrong way right now, because literally there was a body on the streets of this town yesterday being eaten by rats because this woman had been laying in the street for 48 hours.'' His comments pushed right up to the line between tough questioning and confrontational advocacy journalism, but viewers responded. CNN last week expanded Mr. Cooper's prime-time role, teaming him for two hours with Aaron Brown, in addition to his 7 p.m. weeknight show, ''Anderson Cooper 360degrees.'' ''He is the anchorperson of the future,'' Jonathan Klein, the president of CNN/U.S., said in an interview. He is ''an anti-anchorperson,'' he said, adding: ''He's all human. He's not putting it on.'' ''I don't feel like I'm doing anything different,'' Mr. Cooper said of his work on the hurricane, comparing it to 1992 reports he did from Somalia for the Channel One classroom news broadcast. Mr. Cooper said that he did not believe in taking sides and did not think he had done so. ''I am listening to people's questions and getting answers,'' he said. ''I am least of all interested in any TV anchor's opinion, and least of all my own.'' ''This is life and death,'' he added. ''This is not some blow-dried pundit standing outraged for some ratings, which is what cable news often boils down to.'' As for his emotional moments: ''It's absolutely not true; it's lies, lies, spread by that conservative or liberal agenda, whatever it is,'' Mr. Cooper quipped, before conceding: ''I have been tearing up on this story more than any story I've worked on. I can't really explain why that is.'' He has tried not to do it on camera, he said, because ''who wants to see that?'' But, he added: ''It's hard not to be moved. The fact that it is in the United States, for me, added a layer and dimension to the story.'' The producer David Perozzi worked with Mr. Cooper at ABC News, where he reported for ''20/20 Downtown'' and was anchor of the overnight newscast. Mr. Perozzi said that his friend ''has shown a certain amount of heart and compassion,'' adding: ''He does care about people deeply.'' When no major news organization hired him after his graduation from Yale in 1989, Mr. Cooper said he had a friend make a fake press pass and he headed overseas on his own, sending Channel One stories he taped with a small home-video camera. His bare-bones training in Somalia was a precursor for his current assignment. ''When you travel with him, he's no joke,'' Mr. Perozzi said. ''He's really intense. He could care less how he looks, his hair and makeup. If there's no cameraperson, he grabs the camera.'' For all that drive, this is the same person who quit ABC News in 2000 to be the host of ABC's reality show ''The Mole'' when the news division told him to choose between the two jobs. One executive publicly predicted that Mr. Cooper would never work in news again. ''I think at that time he was sort of at a crossroads in his life and wasn't sure about TV news,'' Mr. Perozzi said. ''But it doesn't seem to have hurt him.'' CNN hired him in December 2001, giving him his show in 2003. He often heads to disaster zones, and has reported on the December 2004 tsunami and the Niger famine. ''It sometimes feels as if we need to bungee-cord him to the anchor chair,'' Mr. Klein said, adding that he is happy to have Mr. Cooper stay in the South indefinitely. ''He's young and healthy, he can go forever.'' Mr. Cooper said that his mother, the socialite Gloria Vanderbilt, ''is a little concerned and freaked out'' about his nonstop work, but that he has no plans to return home. ''I can't imagine going back,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''I'm going to have to at some point, but I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know,'' he repeated, his voice trailing away."
"With the first busloads of Katrina refugees about to arrive in San Antonio, the call went out for physician volunteers, and I signed up for the 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. shift. On the way, riding down dark, deserted streets, I thought of driving in for night shifts in the I.C.U. as an intern many years ago, and how I would try to steel myself, as if putting on armor. Within a massive structure at Kelly U.S.A. (formerly Kelly Air Force Base), a brightly lighted processing area led to office cubicles, where after registering, new arrivals with medical needs came to see us. My first patient sat before me, haggard, pointing to what ailed her, as if speech no longer served her. I peeled her shoes from swollen feet, trying not to remove skin in the process. Cuts from submerged objects and immersion in standing water had caused the swelling, as well as infection of both feet. An antibiotic, a pair of slip-ons from the roomful of donated clothing and a night with her feet elevated -- that would help. The ailments common among the refugees included diarrhea, bronchitis, sore throat and voices hoarse or lost. And stress beyond belief. People didn't have their medications, and blood sugars and blood pressures were out of control. I prayed, as I wrote prescriptions, that their memories of particular pills were accurate. For a man on methadone maintenance who was now cramping and sweating, I prescribed codeine to hold him. Another man, clutching a gym bag as if I might snatch it from him, admitted when I gently probed that he was hearing voices again. We sat together looking through the Physicians' Desk Reference. ''That's it,'' he said, recognizing the pill he hadn't taken since the storm hit. Hesitantly, I asked each patient, ''Where did you spend the last five days?'' I wanted to reconcile the person in front of me with the terrible locales on television. But as the night wore on, I understood that they needed me to ask; to not ask was to not honor their ordeal. Hard men wiped at their eyes and became animated in the telling. The first woman, the one who seemed mute from stress, began a recitation in a courtroom voice, as if preparing for future testimony. It reminded me of my previous work in field clinics in India and Ethiopia, where, with so few medical resources at hand, the careful listening, the thorough exam, the laying of hands was the therapy. And I felt the same helplessness, knowing that the illness here was inextricably linked to the bigger problem of homelessness, disenfranchisement and despair. Near the end of my shift, a new group of patients arrived. A man in his 70's with gray hair and beard came in looking fit and vigorous. One eye was milky white and sightless, but the glint in his good eye was enough for two. His worldly belongings were in a garbage bag, but his manner was dignified. He was out of medicine, and his blood sugar and blood pressure were high. He couldn't pay for his medication, so his doctor always gave him samples: ''Whatever he have. Whatever he have.'' He had kept his shoes on for five days, he said, removing the battered, pickled but elegant pair, a cross between bowling shoes and dancing shoes. His toes were carved ebony, the tendons on the back like cables, the joints gnarled but sturdy. All night I had seen many feet; in his bare feet I read resilience. He told me that for two nights after the floods, he had perched on a ledge so narrow that his legs dangled in the water. At one point, he said, he saw Air Force One fly over, and his hopes soared. ''I waited, I waited,'' he said, but no help came. Finally a boat got him to a packed bridge. There, again, he waited. He shook his head in disbelief, smiling though. ''Doc, they treat refugees in other countries better than they treated us.'' ''I'm so sorry,'' I said. ''So sorry.'' He looked at me long and hard, cocking his head as if weighing my words, which sounded so weak, so inadequate. He rose, holding out his hand, his posture firm as he shouldered his garbage bag. ''Thank you, Doc. I needed to hear that. All they got to say is sorry. All they got to say is sorry.'' I was still troubled by him when I left, even though he seemed the hardiest of all. This encounter between two Americans, between doctor and patient, had been carried to all the fullness that was permitted, and yet it was incomplete, as if he had, as a result of this experience, set in place some new barriers that neither I nor anyone else would ever cross. Driving home, I remembered my own metaphor of strapping on armor for the night shift. The years have shown that there is no armor. There never was. The willingness to be wounded may be all we have to offer. Lives Abraham Verghese, M.D., is the Joaquin Cigarroa Jr. Chair and Marvin Forland Distinguished Professor at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio."
"WHEN President Bush went to the virtual ghost town of New Orleans on Thursday to champion a plan for its recovery, his words -- ''This great city will rise again'' -- carried familiar echoes. The American way of facing these calamities: get up off the ground, dust (or dry) yourself off and start over. Dream big, and take back what nature took. After Hurricane Andrew thrashed Florida in 1992, for instance, a high-powered civic group, We Will Rebuild, sprang up, with a vow to make a ''better, healthier community.'' Surveying San Francisco after the earthquake and fire of 1906, the magazine Sunset proclaimed that the city would end up ''greater and more beautiful.'' Nearly a century later, Mr. Bush used similar language and imagery. ''The people of this land have come back from fire, flood and storm to build anew, and to build better than what we had before,'' he declared. Yet shadowing Mr. Bush's plans for a new New Orleans is an uncomfortable notion. Hurricane Katrina was a brutal natural disaster, but it also touched off a manmade one. The chaos and mismanagement, the violence and the racial tensions broadcast to the world recalled not earlier natural disasters, but something else: the strife in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict in 1992; the race riots in Detroit and Newark in 1967, from which neither city fully recovered. In his speech from the French Quarter, Mr. Bush promised ''one of the largest reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen,'' and the federal government will undoubtedly inject tens of billions of dollars into New Orleans. But whatever the financial and engineering challenges in reviving New Orleans, the harder truth is that cities often have difficulty bouncing back from manmade misfortune that throws into doubt their potential as safe places to live and work and invest, urban affairs experts say. Even before Katrina, New Orleans was sliding in prosperity and in population, with high rates of crime and poverty. The question now is whether the jarring aftermath of the storm has fatally wounded New Orleans's reputation in the eyes of the public -- residents and business owners who left and those who might consider moving to New Orleans in the coming years. Hurricane Andrew was nearly as devastating to areas of South Florida, and people also fled, some permanently. But many returned, and while some areas were economically scarred for years, they are now booming. The '92 hurricane did not stir the kind of social strife that tends to make cities seem unwelcoming, perhaps because the underlying fabric of those communities was not frayed in the first place. On the other hand, the lesson of Detroit and Newark is that these events can push teetering cities over the edge. Like New Orleans, they were struggling with a wilting industrial base and the flight of the white middle class. The riots hastened those trends, in part because there was a loss of faith that the cities were governable. The resurrection of New Orleans, in other words, may hinge on whether the storm is remembered more for the collapse of the levees, which can be repaired and bolstered, or the collapse of civil order, whose taint is much harder to wipe away. ''New Orleans has to rebuild not just its buildings and its political culture, but its image,'' said Joel Kotkin, author of ''The City: A Global History.'' ''People want to know whether a place is a credible first-world city,'' Mr. Kotkin said. ''What they found in New Orleans was that underneath the gloss and facade of a first-world tourist attraction was a third-world reality. It will take a lot of work to erase that view.'' Max A. Herman, an assistant professor at Rutgers University in Newark who studies urban unrest in the 20th century, said he had been struck by the similarity between the media images after Katrina and those during the violence in Detroit and Newark. The 1967 riots flared after accusations of police brutality in each city. He cautioned that the situations were dissimilar in many respects, saying that the looting in New Orleans seemed to have been relatively insignificant and received more attention than it deserved. He suggested that there was more sympathy nationally for New Orleans and support for its recovery than was the case with Detroit and Newark in the late 1960's. Back then, black residents were often viewed, unfairly or not, as having brought the disaster upon themselves by attacking the police and burning buildings. But Mr. Herman pointed out that while big employers will probably return to New Orleans, lured by vast sums in federal aid, the small businesses that are the backbone of neighborhoods may be more hesitant. ''It's about not trusting the local government anymore to protect their interests,'' Mr. Herman said. ''That really came up in Newark and Detroit as well. There is really going to be frustration and disappointment among those small-business owners in New Orleans, who are going to say, 'Why wasn't more done to protect us?' And without them, you really can't have a community.'' Still, is this too pessimistic? Before Katrina, people in New Orleans tended to be more rooted to the city than the populations of many other major cities. That may indicate their loyalty to New Orleans, and their willingness to return and make it thrive. In fact, a Gallup poll of urban attitudes across the nation conducted over the summer found that 53 percent of New Orleans residents were extremely satisfied with their personal lives in the city, the highest percentage for any of the 22 cities in the poll, according to Richard Florida, a professor of public policy at George Mason University, who worked on the poll. ''From the images that we saw on TV and from what the experts have been saying, one might think that New Orleans people hated their city, that they thought that it was a dump, that they were horribly dissatisfied,'' Mr. Florida said. ''New Orleans has this incredible potential that the pundits are missing, in that the regular people of New Orleans love their city and get a life satisfaction out of it more than people in Denver or New York or Boston,'' he said. One challenge, then, would seem to be to harness this affection to energize and guide the recovery. But residents have been flung across the region. Who knows how many will return, and when. It will not be clear for months how embittered they have become from the evacuation and relief effort. It is widely held that for urban redevelopment to succeed, people must be actively involved at the neighborhood level. Can they trust in a reconstruction campaign mounted by the same officials who were supposed to have helped them in the days before and after Katrina? After all, New Orleans has a history of political corruption, so the people may already have had a jaded view of officialdom before the storm. The president, of course, journeyed to New Orleans on Thursday to make it clear that government would not let the city down. His speech harked back to the clarion calls made after other natural disasters -- from the flood that decimated Galveston, Tex., in 1900 to the one that hit Grand Forks, N.D., in 1997 -- but at one point, its tone changed. The poverty exposed by Katrina, Mr. Bush said, ''has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America; we have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action.'' Whether intentionally or not, Mr. Bush was echoing a declaration made almost 40 years ago. ''It is time to adopt strategies for action that will produce quick and visible progress,'' it went. Those words come from the report of the Kerner Commission, which investigated the riots in the 1960's that roiled Detroit, Newark and much of urban America. THE NATION: CONFIDENCE FACTOR"
"The Edmond Fahey Funeral Home is one of a handful of peculiar buildings in Hancock County these days, peculiar in that it is still standing. All around lie piles of wood and brick, massacred trees and half-standing houses and yet, in the lobby the other day stood a man patiently perfecting the Windsor knot of his tie. Mr. Fahey? ''What's left of him,'' Mr. Fahey replied. Mr. Fahey did not have time to talk. He had to conduct a funeral and speak with insurance agents. In a back room a woman in an improbably clean black dress stood, waiting. As of Friday, there were 49 deaths attributed to the storm in Hancock County. This is the only remaining funeral home. Mr. Fahey, 63, led the way to the coffee in the kitchen, dragging his prosthetic leg. There he rolled up his sleeve to give himself a shot of insulin, and fondly reminisced about his days as a luxury tour guide, traveling the world and meeting movie stars. The tired-looking staff members listened. All six stayed here with Mr. Fahey during the storm, and now this is the only home they have left. ''Every employee here lost everything,'' said Jeanne Sampognaro, the secretary, emphasizing that no one had packed more than a change of clothes and a few groceries. They lived on those groceries in the home for almost a week before any outside help came. Beds were set up in the parlors. Piles of suits and other clothes were lying across the furniture. Mr. Fahey is a stickler about appearances when meeting families, so Ms. Sampognaro rented a car and drove to Alabama to buy new shirts and ties and pants. Outside in the bright, steamy parking lot was a large refrigerated tractor-trailer, which was respectfully unforthcoming about its contents, and beyond that a little camper. This is now the Hancock County coroner's office. At a small foldout table covered in papers sat Norma C. Stiglet, 71, fingernails painted, hair done up and jewelry dangling from her wrists. Ms. Stiglet, a former ''nice, quiet banker'' turned coroner after the previous coroner -- her husband -- died of cancer, was about to go to the beach, where some skeletal remains had been found (a gator, it turned out). But first she was asked why she stays in that little camper when the county has a spacious emergency command center just a few miles away. She motioned to the tractor-trailer, and spoke of its current tenants as if they were family. ''I need to be by them and with them,'' Ms. Stiglet said. ''I'm not going anywhere.'' CAMPBELL ROBERTSON STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"WITH few economic reports due this week, the Federal Reserve has the stage pretty much to itself. But even if the calendar were full, it would be hard to deflect traders' attention from the first formal opportunity to gauge the Fed's thinking on interest rates and the economy since Hurricane Katrina. Stocks have rallied since the hurricane, at least partly in the hope that the Fed's rate-setting panel will end its streak of 10 consecutive quarter-point rate increases when it meets on Tuesday. That is the expectation of Henry J. Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed, the asset management firm, but he does not think that the Fed will stand pat for long. ''They'll find some reason to go on hold and signal at the same time that the economy is continuing to do well and that just because they are passing this time doesn't mean they won't raise rates again,'' he said. Ultimately, he said, repairing the damage caused by Katrina is likely to result in a new growth spurt. ''Based on everything I'm hearing about the government programs that are going to be put in place to restart New Orleans, you could make the argument that the economy is going to be hurt in the short term,'' Mr. Herrmann said, ''but a reasonable person would conclude that there is then going to be an acceleration'' in growth. As is often the case when the Fed's policy makers announce their rate decisions, the accompanying statement is likely to carry more weight than the decision itself. If the Fed holds steady and hints that further increases are not necessarily in store, stock prices could benefit, Mr. Herrmann said. ''If they pause, I think the wording will be important,'' he said. ''If they don't signal that they are pausing now but probably raising rates again in the future, the market will rally pretty strongly.'' Whatever move the Fed makes is likely to be guided by political considerations as well as economic factors, he added. ''The hurricane is going to have a detrimental effect on consumption for a while, and the economy was already slowing a bit,'' he said. ''With those two threats, the Fed tightening credit will be seen as an additional punishment after the blow dealt by the hurricane.'' DATA WATCH -- Reports on housing starts and building permits will be appetizers on the menu Tuesday before the Fed serves up the main course. Both are expected to have slipped in August, according to a poll of economists by Bloomberg News. A decline is also foreseen in the index of leading economic indicators. That report, to be issued Thursday, is expected to show a 0.3 percent decline for August after a gain of 0.1 percent for July. MARKET WEEK"
"With its strong Cajun traditions, Mardi Gras celebrations and drive-through daiquiri bars, this southern Louisiana city has long sparred with New Orleans for the right to call itself a capital of relaxed revelry, the arts and French-influenced folkways. But as its rival lies in ruins and tens of thousands of evacuees pour in, Lafayette suddenly faces some far different struggles: an accelerating culture clash and a debate over whether the city can, or even wants to, become the new New Orleans. While larger cities like Houston are able to absorb hordes of newcomers without much upheaval, Lafayette is undergoing a huge transformation, its population of 110,000 swelling virtually overnight to more than 150,000. The city, fueled by the fortunes of the petroleum industry, was already growing because of rising oil prices. Now, as it extends a welcoming hand to its neighbors, Lafayette has taken on the trappings of a strained boomtown, with bumper-to-bumper traffic, back-fence talk of a crime wave and fears of a housing crunch. ''The New Orleans crowd came in and changed everything,'' said Chris Deshotel, 24, an employee at a financial services company who had placed an offer on a $165,000 house last week, only to be outbid by a New Orleans family who bought the property with cash. ''I'm sorry about their situation, but I'm sorry about my situation, too.'' Others, though, are excited about the potential economic benefits from both the population surge and the efforts to rebuild New Orleans, 130 miles to the east. Nidal Balbeisi, the owner of Zeus, a Middle Eastern restaurant in downtown Lafayette, said he could not hire people fast enough to help cook meals that are sent to 1,500 relief workers each day in New Orleans. ''It's the craziest thing I've ever seen, and I immigrated to this country from Kuwait after the Saddam invasion,'' he said. Civic leaders are buoyed by the prospect that Lafayette could supplant New Orleans, at least temporarily, as a center for art and jazz, street parties and tourism. In the last week, a benefit concert was held for unemployed musicians from New Orleans as was an outdoor fair where displaced artists sold their paintings. ''We're the entertainment capital of Louisiana now,'' said Gerald Breaux, executive director of the Lafayette Convention and Visitors Commission. ''We're the place where the artists are going to migrate to.'' On a superficial level, at least, few places seem as well equipped to help keep alive the playful culture of New Orleans as Lafayette, which has the bars and vibrant music scene of the larger city, as well as the state's biggest population of Cajuns -- descendants of French Canadians who were expelled from Acadia in the 18th century. Still, Lafayette differs significantly from New Orleans in many ways, from its politics and demographics, to the way its gumbo is prepared (no tomatoes), to its economy, which relies more on the offshore oil industry than on tourists. And in the other city's shadow, Lafayette has labored to assert its own identity, until now. ''A worldview has been turned on its head, in part because New Orleans used to view Lafayette as its poor country relation,'' said Carl A. Brasseaux, director of the Center for Louisiana Studies at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. ''A lot of those differences immediately dissolved with the storm as people here rushed to help any way they could, but it remains to be seen how long the system can afford to sustain this transformation.'' More than 40,000 people from the New Orleans area have arrived in the last two weeks, including more than 1,000 who have camped out at the Cajundome complex. Lafayette schools have taken in more than 3,000 new students, and there is evidence of extraordinary generosity throughout the city. But the sudden influx has also set off tensions. In the first days after the storm, a false rumor swept this city that evacuees had stolen a large cache of firearms from Shooters, one of the largest gun shops in Lafayette. Managers assured frantic callers that they had plenty of guns, and over three days, the shop sold more handguns than it had sold in the previous eight months, said a manager, Al Bernard. ''We also started requiring our salesmen to pack a gun in their holster,'' said Mr. Bernard, 63. ''Just in case someone from not around here comes in and gets the wrong idea, we want him to know there will be swift response.'' The police said there had been no rise in crime. One longer-term test of the changes will lie in the tolerance Lafayette extends to some of its new guests. Joey Durel, the president of Lafayette City-Parish, refused last week to grant a permit to the organizers of Southern Decadence, a gay festival in New Orleans that had tried to transfer the event to Lafayette. ''I don't consider anything that's got the word 'decadence' in it to be normalcy,'' Mr. Durel was quoted as saying in The Daily Advertiser, Lafayette's main newspaper. Lafayette is a predominantly white city with a culture that is more rural than that of New Orleans, and its politics tilt more Republican than those of its mostly Democratic rival. Largely Roman Catholic and Cajun, it is removed culturally as well as geographically from the Bible Belt of northern Louisiana. ''Lafayette is just much more conservative than New Orleans,'' said Richard Angelle, a principal at Petroleum Solutions, an energy consulting firm in Lafayette. ''New Orleans is 65 percent black, which means more Democrats and less Republicans.'' Much of that could change if the evacuees stay. Oil services companies hungry for workers have put up help-wanted signs in the Cajundome, though it is not clear how many evacuees have the training needed for those positions. Many of the storm's survivors have little inclination to go home. ''It's better here than New Orleans,'' said Latoya McCallon, 18, who was smoking a cigarette outside the Cajundome. Ms. McCallon, who worked at Wal-Mart before fleeing her home city, said she wanted to study at a college in Lafayette. ''I feel there's good opportunity here,'' she said. STORM AND CRISIS: REPERCUSSIONS"
"Although the water that now covers much of New Orleans is a fetid broth of sewage, with gasoline from gas stations, solvents from dry cleaners and chemicals from household cleaners mixed in, it could have been a great deal worse, experts said yesterday. In their worst fears, the hurricane-blown storm surge would have crashed over levees through the chemical plants south and east of the city, cracking open storage tanks and stirring large amounts of highly toxic substances into the floodwaters. But that ''did not happen, to our knowledge,'' said John H. Pardue, director of the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at Louisiana State University. ''It's not the worst scenario we could have envisioned.'' Though there were breaks in levees, they did not occur until after the storm passed. Many plants flooded, including a large Exxon refinery, but the waters' slow rise did not carry the force of a storm surge. New Orleans is also fortunate in that the sediments of Lake Pontchartrain, where most of the floodwater originated, are not heavily polluted. ''The majority of the silt that's going to be deposited in the city is probably not going to be hazardous,'' said Gaboury Benoit, a professor at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Still, the floodwaters are hardly pristine. Some dangerous chemicals are heavier than water, potentially forming toxic pools that are not visible. Gasoline and other fuel floating on the surface can catch fire. Dr. Pardue said L.S.U. researchers hoped to get to New Orleans in the next day or two to test the water, especially in neighborhoods that could be ''hot spots'' downstream from any spills that did occur at the chemical plants. The chemicals probably do not pose a major health hazard now, scientists said. ''The concentrations would have to be much, much larger when it's diluted by so much floodwater like that,'' said Jerald Schnoor, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Iowa and editor of the journal Environmental Science and Technology. ''I can't imagine that would be a large problem.'' But as the floodwaters recede, they could concentrate in a layer of contamination that would complicate the cleanup. The larger immediate concern is sewage that has mixed in with the floodwater. Bacteria or viruses from the sewage could cause intestinal illness in anyone who ingests the water. Fears of disease outbreaks led federal officials yesterday to announce a public health emergency for the entire Gulf Coast. Walking in the water is less of a risk. But it ''can be a risk if there are wounds,'' said Dr. Dennis Juranek of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HURRICANE KATRINA: HEALTH CONCERNS"
"Playing sporting events in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is such a daunting prospect that the National Basketball Association is bracing to relocate its local franchise for the entire coming season. The N.B.A. does not begin play until November, but the deputy commissioner Russ Granik sent an e-mail message to the league's 30 teams yesterday to prepare them for the Hornets' possible relocation. ''Even if the arena is operable, it still may be impossible to play games in New Orleans for some time,'' Granik wrote in the e-mail message, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. It is a similar reality faced by the Saints of the National Football League, Tulane University and other university and professional sports teams in New Orleans. With the city being evacuated and with an estimated two months until power returns, uncertainty lingers. The Saints and the Tulane football team will operate out of Texas. After a preseason game tonight in Oakland, the Saints will fly to San Antonio and practice there until their opening game at Carolina on Sept. 11. Possible locations for the Saints to play their home games, including their Sept. 18 home opener against the Giants, are Louisiana State in Baton Rouge, which was relatively unaffected by the storm; Birmingham, Ala.; San Antonio; and Los Angeles. Tulane's team arrived in Dallas, where it was staying in a local hotel and sharing football facilities with Southern Methodist. Many Tulane students have also relocated to Dallas, moving into the S.M.U. student union, which has been nicknamed Camp Katrina. Rick Dickson, the Tulane athletic director, said the chance of there even being classes at Tulane this semester was ''remote.'' ''That's beyond the first phase of this,'' Dickson said in a telephone interview. ''We're trying to make certain everyone is in safe harbor.'' Granik's e-mail message said that plans were already under way to find locations for the Hornets' training camp, which starts Oct. 3, and preseason games. The league will begin searching for regular-season alternatives next week, when there is expected to be a better analysis of the damage to New Orleans. If the Hornets are forced to relocate -- whether for a few weeks or the entire season -- the league will seek to place them close to home. L.S.U. offers the closest alternative, about 60 miles away, and an arena, Pete Maravich Assembly Center, that holds 14,164 people. That is small by N.B.A. standards, but it could accommodate the Hornets, whose average attendance last season was a league-worst 14,221. ''Right now, we're kind of all focused on the humanitarian relief effort and haven't really focused on the implications yet for the Hornets,'' said Tim Andree, senior vice president for communications for the N.B.A. All Hornets employees have been accounted for and are safe, Andree said. But it has been an anxious time for friends and associates, who have had difficulty reaching Hornets employees and players. ''I have not been able to get a hold of anyone,'' said Mark Bartelstein, a player agent whose clients include Hornets forward P.J. Brown. ''We've been calling pretty much nonstop and have had no luck making contact.'' L.S.U. is also a speculative favorite for the Saints' relocation. Many campus athletic facilities are currently being used as shelters and a hospital for hurricane victims. The outdoor track has been converted to a landing pad for helicopters dropping off people rescued from the floods. ''You'll hear three helicopters in a row and then not hear one for 30 minutes,'' said Herb Vincent, an associate athletic director at L.S.U. ''There's anything from private helicopters to Black Hawks.'' The Maravich Center is a triage unit and the university's indoor track field house is serving as a special-needs unit. Nicholson Drive, a main campus thoroughfare that would have been cluttered with tailgaters this weekend for the L.S.U. home football opener Saturday, is instead being used by ambulances. L.S.U. postponed its opener against North Texas. ''Before the hurricane, it would have been one big Mardi Gras-type party this weekend,'' Vincent said. ''But it wasn't appropriate to have that when there's people with dire needs and emergencies.'' Tulane was not the only Conference USA university forced to evacuate; Southern Mississippi's team relocated to Memphis. Southern Miss and Tulane were scheduled to play each other this weekend. Other than postponing that game until Nov. 26, Dickson, the Tulane athletic director, said no other athletic decisions had been made. Dickson said that there was significant damage to every building on Tulane's campus and that the university was exploring setting up a satellite campus. The N.C.A.A. said it would be flexible in the wake of the storm, including letting students at places like Tulane compete if they were not enrolled in school. Numerous relief funds have been set up through sports organizations, including by Conference USA. The N.F.L. donated $1 million to the American Red Cross for the hurricane victims and the N.B.A. players union announced plans to raise $1 million."
"Dave Bernzweig saw them as soon as he peered inside the small brick house: two more lost souls, wedged among the soaked ruins of their belongings. He recorded the location of the bodies, between the front door and the flowered couch, then moved across the street, where another victim of Hurricane Katrina lay. Mr. Bernzweig and his colleagues from Ohio Task Force One, a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency hunting for storm survivors with dozens of other search and rescue teams on the Gulf Coast, have punishing work ahead of them. In this area of coastal Mississippi lashed hard when the eye of the hurricane passed just to the west, they are looking for the living in dangerous, putrid mountains of debris that too often hold only the dead. The heat is excruciating, and the stench of detritus, even in areas where no one has died, turns stomachs. ''We go now, on Day 3, by the smells,'' said Doug Cope, the search team manager, ''just like the dogs.'' The team from Ohio spent most of Wednesday in ''blitz mode,'' searching Pass Christian, a community on the eastern side of St. Louis Bay, for people who might be trapped in pancaked homes. They worked in pairs with dogs that sniffed each rubble pile for traces of human scent, but had found no one by midafternoon. On Tuesday, other teams scouring the neighborhood found at least eight people. They also found many dead pets and two live snakes, including a poisonous copperhead. ''The locals say this section was really beautiful down here,'' said Mr. Cope, looking at tumbles of wood, bricks, trees, wires, furniture, clothing, mud. ''A lot of summer homes for people from Jackson and New Orleans.'' At one point, Mr. Bernzweig and Jack Reall went over to the Belle Rose subdivision, responding to calls from residents who had not seen their neighbors since the storm. That is where they found the bodies of the couple in their living room, and that of a third elderly victim buried under his collapsed ceiling. Up and down the street, there were bodies in houses that had been swamped by more than 20 feet of water. ''They found Don,'' Jennifer Noll told her sister, watching from her driveway as Mr. Bernzweig and Mr. Reall made their sad discoveries. ''Betty and Charlie, too.'' Mrs. Noll said she last saw the couple alive when her family fled the imminent storm on Sunday morning. The wife had just undergone hip surgery, she said, so they had decided to stay home. ''Their son was going to come and get them,'' she said, sobbing, ''but they told him not to. You see this stuff on TV and you never think it's going to happen to you.'' Mr. Bernzweig and Mr. Reall marked the houses to indicate there were bodies inside -- the coroner's office, overwhelmed, would come when it got the chance -- then moved on. In Waveland, a coastal community to the west just across the bay, where many residents had stayed in their homes believing that the storm would skirt them, a woman drenched from the rain ran up to rescue workers from Virginia climbing through debris a few blocks from the beach. ''My mother, we saw her red Ford Focus under her house!'' said the woman, Maureen Burnett. ''She might be alive,'' Ms. Burnett said, clenching her fists. ''We heard knocking.'' The rescue workers followed her directions over a pile of debris where refrigerators mingled with branches and mattresses and up a roof that lay flat in the middle of Grosvenor Avenue. ''Look down!'' Ms. Burnett hollered. ''See that car? That's her car. See that kitchen table? That's her table.'' ''The house ain't there,'' she added softly. ''Mom!'' she bellowed. ''Ma!'' Ms. Burnett and her family had gone north to friends', but her mother, who was 76 and worked at Wal-Mart even at her age, had insisted she would not leave. ''I made her leave for Ivan,'' Ms. Burnett said of the storm last year that, it turned out, did not cause much damage here. ''She never forgave me.'' ''She said, 'I'm not leaving, even if it's Category 10'; well, she's so damn stubborn,'' Ms. Burnett said, beginning to cry. Then Ms. Burnett saw a dog. ''Buddy, that's her dog,'' she said. ''My mom's with the dog.'' The workers untangled a gently barking Buddy from some branches and then, when one spotted a body farther on, turned and signaled to another worker, who led Ms. Burnett off the roof and back to the rescue truck. ''Buddy, you're a miracle,'' Ms. Burnett said to the dog, then turned to the worker, Debbie Crisher. ''She's in there, isn't she?'' ''They're still looking,'' Ms. Crisher said. The search team turned over the body. It was that of Ms. Burnett's mother. They trudged back through power lines, trees and mud as heavy as wet concrete. ''Did you find her?'' Ms. Burnett asked. The squad leader, Jon Rigolo, took her aside and gave her the news. Ms. Burnett nodded and began crying again. Members of this team, from Virginia Beach, did search and rescue last year after Hurricanes Ivan and Frances. ''That's the hard part,'' said Michael Carter, a paramedic, gesturing toward Ms. Burnett, who was now embracing a brother who had flown in from California. As in Pass Christian, the rescue workers in Waveland went house to house looking for people or bodies. One stuck a long hose with a mini-camera on the end of it underneath crushed houses to see if he could spot anything. Others simply yelled: ''Hello! Hello!'' Though neither the Ohio nor the Virginia team was finding survivors on Wednesday, Joe Spraggins, director of emergency operations for Harrison County, which includes Pass Christian, said there had been a number of miracles. ''I can tell you that it's happening every minute,'' Mr. Spraggins said, ''that we're actually finding somebody under rubble or we are finding somebody hanging out of a building, and they're still alive and they've been hanging on for the last two days.'' To the west, in the Hancock County town of Pearlington, Miss., along the East Pearl River near the Louisiana border, several sick and elderly residents were trapped in heavily damaged homes without food or water until a state police rescue team arrived Wednesday morning. One 64-year-old resident, Cecil Hughes, helped direct the rescue team to two elderly women who had held on to the rafters of their porch on Monday to keep from being swept away by the hurricane's tidal surge. The women, who had not eaten for two days, were airlifted to a hospital by a police helicopter. ''It's like Hiroshima back there,'' Mr. Hughes said, pointing down the muddy road leading from U.S. 90 toward Pearlington, a town of about 2,000 people. In downtown Waveland, one rescue squad searched an apartment complex after a woman who had escaped to a blown-out hotel nearby told them her neighbors in the complex had not left before the storm. The rescue workers found the neighbors, a family of four, dead, along with two others. ''The hardest part is, it didn't have to be this way,'' said David Cash, one of two doctors with the Virginia Beach team. ''If people had evacuated -- of course, where are they going to evacuate to? But other people did evacuate. Everybody that died here was needless. It's just the senselessness of it all.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: MISSISSIPPI"
"Efforts to get food, water and electricity to the hundreds of thousands of survivors of Hurricane Katrina have been hampered by a lack of an essential tool: the ability of aid groups, utilities and even the phone companies to communicate with one another. Landline and wireless phone service across the Gulf Coast from New Orleans eastward has been largely cut off, and restoring it will take weeks, if not months. As many as 750,000 BellSouth landline customers and millions of cellphone customers are thought to be without service across Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, though precise figures are hard to come by because phone companies have been unable to get to all their equipment to assess the damage. ''As difficult as last year was,'' said Bill Smith, the chief technology officer at BellSouth, speaking of the efforts to restore service after a string of hurricanes in Florida, ''it may have been a dress rehearsal for what we're seeing now.'' The spotty or nonexistent coverage in the affected areas highlights one longstanding myth about cellular phone service: that users can make calls even when electric power or landlines are inoperable. What millions of Americans do not realize is that cellphone service relies on land-based fiber optic networks to route calls. When customers place cellphone calls, their calls are sent to nearby antennas, which are connected to base stations operated by each mobile phone company. Those base stations pass on the calls using fiber optic lines to switching stations operated by BellSouth and other landline providers. BellSouth then sends the calls on to their destinations. If any of this equipment is out of service, whether because of fallen trees, cut cables or flooding, calls typically cannot be placed. ''If we don't have landline connectivity to our equipment at the towers, it doesn't matter if it's running,'' said James J. Gerace, a vice president at Verizon Wireless. ''Customers could be getting five bars on their phone and they can't get through.'' Much of the cellphone system relies on electric power, too. When electricity is interrupted, many switching stations and cellular base stations switch automatically to alternate power sources, either batteries or generators that run on diesel fuel. BellSouth, for instance, has 180 switching stations running on generators. But most of these sources can supply only 24 to 48 hours of alternate power, which means many stations could shut down soon. While the worst disruptions are in and around New Orleans, where the most equipment is submerged, coverage is only slowly improving elsewhere in the region. In the hard-hit towns along the Mississippi coast, phone company workers -- not to mention ordinary cellphone users -- are having to trek five miles or more inland to get a signal on their phones. Cellular companies have been trying to fix this problem by moving ''cell sites on wheels'' into the area. Verizon, for instance, has 20 of these three-axle trucks, some working in Baton Rouge, La., and some sitting on elevated roadways in New Orleans waiting for a place to go. As with stationary cellular base stations, though, these ''COW's'' have to connect to a wider network to complete calls. Some will connect directly to telephone switching equipment. Others will connect using microwave antennas that beam signals to other dishes that are connected to networks. Many of the New Orleans residents with a 504 area code have been unable to receive calls on their cellphones, even if they have left the region. All cellphones have a home switching office, which keeps billing and service data. When people call a 504 number, the disabled switching stations in New Orleans are unable to route the call. While voice coverage in New Orleans and other areas hit by the hurricane is sporadic, some cellphone customers have been sending and receiving text messages. These messages get through because, unlike voice calls, they do not need to immediately connect to a user on the other side. Rather, the data packets that form a message are small and will wait until a network is free. To circumvent cellular networks entirely, many officials -- including some phone company chiefs -- are using satellite phones. They do not rely on equipment on the ground because they beam their signals to low-orbiting satellites. But the batteries on these phones can provide only about six hours of talk time. Some are equipped with solar rechargers, while others can be plugged into cigarette lighters and wall jacks. Iridium, one of the country's largest suppliers of satellite phones, said the amount of traffic from the region on its satellites had doubled since the storm and was likely to rise further. Some of Iridium's dealers have also been swamped by requests for handsets, which typically cost $1,500 each. Craig Van Wagner, the chief salesman at GMPCS, a distributor of Iridium phones in Pompano Beach, Fla., said he had ''done a month's worth of business in two days,'' or about $1 million in sales. Getting the phones to customers is another question. GMPCS is shipping handsets by overnight mail to Jackson, Miss.; Birmingham, Ala.; and other cities near the worst-hit areas. Customers are typically picking up their phones there because delivery service is so spotty closer to the heavily damaged towns. Carmen L. Lloyd, Iridium's chief executive, said he had been scrounging up thousands of handsets to send to emergency service workers and others in the area. HURRICANE KATRINA: COMMUNICATIONS"
"It is daunting what the 600 patients and staff members trapped by a moat of filthy water inside Charity Hospital in New Orleans have been doing without. The lights are down, which means that medication must be rushed through sodden hallways by flashlight after dark. The ventilators are down, which meant that, for a while, nurses had to pump the airbags of pulmonary cases by hand. There are few phones. No x-ray machines. No CAT scans. No computers. No air-conditioners. The lab is down, which means that if a patient has an infection, physicians must determine how serious it is by using their sense of smell. ''In a lot of ways, we're functioning as if we were in a developing country at this point,'' said Dr. Kiersta Kurtz-Burke, a physician at the hospital, reached yesterday on one of its few working land lines.''We're doing the best we can, but it's a new experience.'' With communication and transportation systems on the Gulf Coast severely damaged, there was no clear way to get the global view of the health care crisis in the region. Many hospitals, particularly in New Orleans, were being evacuated, including Charity and Tulane University Hospital and Clinic. While some patients were being sent to hospitals elsewhere in Louisiana, some of the most seriously ill patients have been sent by helicopter to hospitals in Texas, Mississippi and Alabama. One New Orleans hospital, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, had to airlift 12 of the 13 premature babies in its neonatal intensive care unit. Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O. Leavitt held a conference call with hospitals across the country yesterday asking for help in caring for patients and supplying doctors and nurses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has deployed nearly 40 medical teams to set up field hospitals under tents. And the Navy has announced that it will send the hospital ship Comfort to the Gulf of Mexico. It is expected to arrive Sept. 8. As grim as they are, the immediate health care problems may be dwarfed by those to come. Medical experts warned of diseases spread by tainted water, spoiled food, breeding insects and snakes. For now, nearly 10,000 people, mostly staff members and their families, are waiting to be evacuated from at least nine hospitals in the New Orleans area, according to the Louisiana Hospital Association. Tenet Healthcare, which has six hospitals directly affected in the region, was evacuating more than 3,000 patients, staff and others from four hospitals, said Steven Campanini, a spokesman: the Gulf Coast Medical Center in Biloxi, Miss., and three hospitals in the New Orleans area. ''We're doing everything we can at a state, federal and local level,'' including hiring private helicopters to speed the process, he said. At Tulane, patients were expected to be transferred by the end of yesterday, leaving about 1,000 others, mostly employees and their families, in need of transportation, said Jeff Prescott, a spokesman for HCA, which operates the facility. Some patients were being transported by boats provided by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Biloxi Regional Medical Center remained open and operational, said John Merriwether, a spokesman for Health Management Associates, which owns the center. It had been accepting transfers from other hospitals as well as patients walking in. ''We are the only ray of light in Biloxi right now,'' said Mr. Merriwether. What distinguishes this disaster from others is the impact on so many hospitals in a region, said Mark Wietecha, a hospital consultant for Kurt Salmon Associates. ''This is probably the only time we have so many facilities being considered inoperable,'' he said. While hospitals have contingency plans, they are not prepared to operate in extensive and prolonged flood conditions. Ochsner was one of the few hospitals that had been able to remain open in New Orleans. It sits eight feet above sea level and did not suffer flooding, Aimee Goforth, a spokeswoman, said. A critical-care transport team from the University of Alabama in Birmingham evacuated four of the premature babies from Ochsner. Valorie Tucker, a nurse practitioner who was on the flight, said that, except for a few tears, the babies remained stable during the flight. As is standard practice, the parents were not brought along. One of the main challenges facing the hospitals is getting supplies. ''We have plenty of product. The challenge is to get it where it is needed,'' said William S. Smith, an executive vice president for Cardinal Health, a distributor serving the area. The problems at Charity Hospital, a few blocks from the Superdome in central New Orleans, started Monday morning, Dr. Kurtz-Burke said, when water swept through the first-floor emergency room and dozens of windows were shattered by the wind. The power went out around 8 a.m., she said, and though the backup generators quickly clicked on, they too went out shortly afterward. The hospital had evacuated its healthiest patients over the weekend, Dr. Kurtz-Burke said. But that left the immobile and unmovable behind, including stroke patients, amputees and those in intensive care. Dr. Kurtz-Burke said the main goal now was to keep patients stable until the National Guard finished its evacuation of the hospital. That began on Tuesday, she said, with some patients lowered down stairs on spine boards, still hooked up to IV lines or oxygen tanks, in the dark. The only power was from batteries, she said. The emergency room was moved from the soaked first floor to the second Tuesday morning. Amazingly, the hospital kitchen was open but was serving only things like cold canned ravioli and soup. Nonetheless, morale was good, Dr. Kurtz-Burke said. There were inflatable mattresses in storage rooms to nap on, and plenty of peanut butter and cornflakes to go around. The infectious-disease unit, on the ninth floor of the west wing, even hung a banner in defiance of the storm. ''9-W has a heart -- Katrina can't tear it apart,'' it said. HURRICANE KATRINA: IN THE WATER"
"The impulse to rebuild follows any catastrophe within hours, relief drawn on a future account when there is little comfort in the present. But when New Orleans staggers out of the devastation now engulfing it, it will face questions of an unimagined scale, beginning with how much of its urban fabric -- from the cherished to the derelict -- will even be salvageable as a foundation for rebuilding. ''Tens of thousands of homes and businesses are beyond repair,'' President Bush said yesterday after flying over the region. And Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said after an aerial inspection of New Orleans, ''There are places that are no longer there.'' That means there cannot yet be a blueprint for rebuilding. ''I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen,'' said Grover E. Mouton III, director of the Tulane Regional Urban Design Center at Tulane University, who was at a conference in San Francisco when the hurricane hit. ''There's nothing to look to as a next step.'' Long before it comes time to decide how faithfully the French Quarter and Garden District can be restored, or whether new dwellings should replicate old shotgun houses, New Orleans must struggle first with restoring its infrastructure. At Entergy, the utility that serves the city, Randy Helmick, the vice president for customer service and head of the system command center, said technicians could not get near equipment to determine its status. ''We cannot and will not begin performing restoration in that area, until the flooding has gone down,'' he said. The underground system is designed to be submerged, and may be unscathed, he said, but above-ground equipment has been damaged. The electronic controls on dozens of transformers, which must stay dry, are probably submerged now. Service will not be restored until each house has been inspected for wiring damage, he said, ''to ensure we're not going to create a problem by re-energizing.'' ''It's going to be a huge, huge task,'' Mr. Helmick said. The giant pumps that will have to dry out New Orleans are operated by the New Orleans Sewage and Water Board, which has its own generators, he said. What will be left when the waters recede or are pumped away will be a city that has been inundated not only with water but with a witches' brew of petroleum byproducts, industrial and household chemicals and human waste. ''The toxic soup, as it has been called, is touching every square inch of the flooded areas,'' said W. Paul Farmer, the executive director of the American Planning Association. ''That issue of the environmental cleanup is one that we have not typically faced with other disasters. It's not just the structural integrity of the buildings, but it's the whole issue of contamination: contamination of buildings, contamination of yards.'' Mr. Farmer, who grew up in Shreveport, is betting on rebuilding, in part because the people of New Orleans tend to stay put. In 2000, 85.4 percent of the population of New Orleans ages 5 and older was living in the same county (Orleans Parish) as in 1995, according to census figures provided by the Queens College department of sociology. Nationwide, 79.1 percent of the population was living in the same county in 2000 as in 1995. ''It is one of our more stable cities in terms of a population that has stayed,'' Mr. Farmer said. ''It's not a city where people leave in large percentages or arrive in large percentages, except as tourists. So I think you're going to see a very strong impulse among the people there to rebuild.'' What might a rebuilt New Orleans look like? ''The lesson of disasters, natural and manmade, is that we generally rebuild more or less what was there,'' Witold Rybczynski, a professor of urbanism and real estate at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an e-mail message. ''The reasons for this are probably mainly pragmatic (existing property ownership, buried infrastructure) but also perhaps sentimental: the urge to recreate what had been destroyed, to rebuild the world we knew.'' Mr. Mouton said the world New Orleans knew merited preservation: the radiant and conflicting street grids, neighborhoods like Bywater and Marigny ''that people have fought so hard to keep together,'' the human scale of the architecture. ''It would be sad to see any wholesale reconstruction of the old urban plan of the city,'' he said. ''That would be tragic.'' But Jerold S. Kayden, co-chairman of the urban planning and design department at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, said there may be no choice in some areas. ''In a true sense, physically, in certain parts of the city, there is a tabula rasa,'' he said, ''which raises the question of whether there's anything left of a real memory.'' Berlin, much of which was leveled in World War II, resisted a blank slate approach ''yet really in a daring way developed a city into the 21st century,'' said Daniel Libeskind, the master planner of the World Trade Center site, who is also working on the reconstruction of Unawatuna, a town in Sri Lanka that was devastated by the tsunami. Speaking of the heritage of New Orleans, Mr. Libeskind added: ''To work with that history doesn't mean to imitate it or make it kitsch or simply simulate it but to really take the roots of great culture and build upon it. And what could be more creative than jazz? It's the right theme. You can build in a rich way with a variety of voices, yet create an overall structure of harmony.'' Even the highest rebuilding aspirations are likely to be tempered by a sense of urgency. ''Time is an enemy because people's needs exceed the amount of time that's needed to do planning,'' said Kenneth C. Topping, the former city planning director of Los Angeles, who now runs Topping Associates International in Cambria, Calif. ''You have to make a series of judgments on the fly,'' he said. ''There are so many moving parts when you're rebuilding. Much of the work is short-term work, to get people into decent facilities that they can live in for several years. But that doesn't even come until you get them sheltered properly and fed.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: REBUILDING"
"Guy T. Williams is usually to be found behind his desk downtown, where he is the president of the Gulf Coast Bank and Trust Company. But nothing is usual in New Orleans, and on Wednesday Mr. Williams was paddling his canoe in a submerged residential area between downtown and the overflowing Lake Pontchartrain, exploring flooded homes not yet reached by rescue teams. He found a seven-story apartment complex with 170 people, including someone blind, another with no legs, a third with a heart condition, and a small child. He gave the list and directions to members of a Texas task force working with the relief effort. A volunteer citizen navy with its own flotilla responded Wednesday to calls for help. Among them were Linda Duplechain of Arnaudville, La., near Lafayette, a store manager, who, with her husband, Mike, joined 100 neighbors, all with boats, in a convoy to New Orleans in the wee hours. They helped ferry hundreds of people still trapped by the flood from drop-off areas to ambulances and medical teams waiting at the foot of I-610, where the Interstate disappeared into the waters. Also responding from Lafayette were Chad Meaux, owner of an oil field support business, and an employee, Mark Jenkins. They drove through the night to arrive by 4 a.m. Another volunteer was Chester Huvall Jr., a truck driver from New Iberia, La., who said he rushed here with his 16-foot aluminum boat ''to answer prayers.'' He said he was determined to rescue someone. He said he had been watching the news about the disaster Tuesday night and said, ''Gee, I wish there was something I could do.'' ''As soon as I said that,'' he related, ''a state senator came on asking everyone with a boat to head for New Orleans.'' ''It was like the Lord heard me,'' Mr. Huvall said. He piloted his craft along Interstate 10, now deep below the floodwaters.At a cemetery he spotted a white, skull-like object near the boat. ''What is that?'' he gasped. It turned out to be a submerged plaster angel, hands covering its weeping face. Mr. Huvall slowed down. ''I don't want to hit a headstone,'' he said. He also slowed down for submerged cars, eerily visible below the waters. ''I don't want to scratch the paint,'' he said. He passed a house submerged to the eaves, where he had earlier banged on the roof. There was no response -- many of the residents had been rescued earlier. He gazed at passing police and sheriff's boats packed with survivors and said, almost enviously: ''Look at all the people they rescued. Why can't I be doing that?'' HURRICANE KATRINA: VOLUNTEERS"
"George W. Bush gave one of the worst speeches of his life yesterday, especially given the level of national distress and the need for words of consolation and wisdom. In what seems to be a ritual in this administration, the president appeared a day later than he was needed. He then read an address of a quality more appropriate for an Arbor Day celebration: a long laundry list of pounds of ice, generators and blankets delivered to the stricken Gulf Coast. He advised the public that anybody who wanted to help should send cash, grinned, and promised that everything would work out in the end. We will, of course, endure, and the city of New Orleans must come back. But looking at the pictures on television yesterday of a place abandoned to the forces of flood, fire and looting, it was hard not to wonder exactly how that is going to come to pass. Right now, hundreds of thousands of American refugees need our national concern and care. Thousands of people still need to be rescued from imminent peril. Public health threats must be controlled in New Orleans and throughout southern Mississippi. Drivers must be given confidence that gasoline will be available, and profiteering must be brought under control at a moment when television has been showing long lines at some pumps and spot prices approaching $4 a gallon have been reported. Sacrifices may be necessary to make sure that all these things happen in an orderly, efficient way. But this administration has never been one to counsel sacrifice. And nothing about the president's demeanor yesterday -- which seemed casual to the point of carelessness -- suggested that he understood the depth of the current crisis. While our attention must now be on the Gulf Coast's most immediate needs, the nation will soon ask why New Orleans's levees remained so inadequate. Publications from the local newspaper to National Geographic have fulminated about the bad state of flood protection in this beloved city, which is below sea level. Why were developers permitted to destroy wetlands and barrier islands that could have held back the hurricane's surge? Why was Congress, before it wandered off to vacation, engaged in slashing the budget for correcting some of the gaping holes in the area's flood protection? It would be some comfort to think that, as Mr. Bush cheerily announced, America ''will be a stronger place'' for enduring this crisis. Complacency will no longer suffice, especially if experts are right in warning that global warming may increase the intensity of future hurricanes. But since this administration won't acknowledge that global warming exists, the chances of leadership seem minimal. Editorial"
"The 17th Street levee that gave way and led to the flooding of New Orleans was part of an intricate, aging system of barriers and pumps that was so chronically underfinanced that senior regional officials of the Army Corps of Engineers complained about it publicly for years. Often leading the chorus was Alfred C. Naomi, a senior project manager for the corps and a 30-year veteran of efforts to waterproof a city built on slowly sinking mud, surrounded by water and periodically a target of great storms. Mr. Naomi grew particularly frustrated this year as the Gulf Coast braced for what forecasters said would be an intense hurricane season and a nearly simultaneous $71million cut was announced in the New Orleans district budget to guard against such storms. He called the cut drastic in an article in New Orleans CityBusiness. In an interview last night, Mr. Naomi said the cuts had made it impossible to complete contracts for vital upgrades that were part of the long-term plan to renovate the system. This week, amid news of the widening breach in the 17th Street Canal, he realized that the decadeslong string of near misses had ended. ''A breach under these conditions was ultimately not surprising,'' he said last night. ''I had hoped that we had overdesigned it to a point that it would not fail. But you can overdesign only so much, and then a failure has to come.'' No one expected that weak spot to be on a canal that, if anything, had received more attention and shoring up than many other spots in the region. It did not have broad berms, but it did have strong concrete walls. Shea Penland, director of the Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of New Orleans, said that was particularly surprising because the break was ''along a section that was just upgraded.'' ''It did not have an earthen levee,'' Dr. Penland said. ''It had a vertical concrete wall several feel thick.'' Now the corps is scrambling. After failing to close a 300-foot break in the canal through which most of the floodwater entered the city, federal engineers decided last night to take the battle with Lake Pontchartrain to the lakefront. Starting today, they will prepare to drive corrugated vertical steel plates, called sheet pile, into the mud near where the narrow canal meets the lake, sealing it off so that the big breach farther in can be more methodically attacked, Mr. Naomi said. The decision was made after a day of fruitless efforts to figure how to drop concrete highway barriers or huge sandbags into the torrent. For the most part, the water between the lake and the filled bowl of the city leveled off as of last night, officials said. Weaknesses in the levee system were foreshadowed in a report in May on the hurricane protection plan for the region and the budget gap. The district headquarters said, ''The current funding shortfalls in fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006 will prevent the Corps from addressing these pressing needs.'' They also meant that there was far too little money to study thoroughly an upgrade of the protections from the existing standard, enough to hold back a hurricane at Category 3 on the five-step intensity scale, to a level to withstand floods and winds from a Category 5 storm. Hurricane Katrina was on the high end of Category 4 and, despite the extreme flooding, is still seen by many hurricane experts as a near miss for New Orleans. Since 2001, the Louisiana Congressional delegation had pushed for far more money for storm protection than the Bush administration has accepted. Now, Mr. Naomi said, all the quibbling over the storm budget, or even over full Category 5 protection, which would cost several billion dollars, seemed tragically absurd. ''It would take $2.5billion to build a Category 5 protection system, and we're talking about tens of billions in losses, all that lost productivity, and so many lost lives and injuries and personal trauma you'll never get over,'' Mr. Naomi said. ''People will be scarred for life by this event.'' He said there were still no clear hints why the main breach in the flood barriers occurred along the 17th Street Canal, normally a conduit for vast streams of water pumped out of the perpetually waterlogged city each day and which did not take the main force of the waves roiling the lake. He said that a low spot marked on survey charts of the levees near the spot that ruptured was unrelated and that the depression was where a new bridge crossed the narrow canal near the lakefront. Some experts studying flood prevention with the corps and other agencies speculated that any dip in the retaining levee or walls there might have allowed water to slop over and start the collapse. Mr. Naomi said that as the power of the hurricane grew clear over the weekend, he and others who had worked to make the system as strong as it could be, given the design limits, could only hope that it would hold. But, he said, he knew that the chances were high that the rising waters and crashing waves would find a fatal weak spot in the 350 miles of levees and walls. As often occurs after a storm, Lake Pontchartrain is sloshing back and forth, sending pulses of water into the city and potentially complicating repairs, Dr. Penland said. ''It's like you have a bowl of water and you shake it, and it sloshes back and forth,'' he said, describing a phenomenon that geologists call a seiche (pronounced sesh). ''Mississippi Sound and Pontchartrain are real prone to seiches when big storms come through. We are seeing the slosh. Water is being flushed through the gaps in the levees.'' He said scientists at the United States Geological Survey estimated that the sloshing would gradually diminish in a few days. Until then, the city will be subject not just to normal variation in the lake, where water levels change about a foot between high and low tide, but also to the variations of the seiche. ''You have not just the one-foot tide, you probably have three to four feet of water,'' Dr. Penland said. ''Once we get to an ordinary tidal regime, when it plays out, that will be our opportunity to close those breaks in the levees and start pumping.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE LEVEE"
"The age-old tools when searching for a missing loved one, a flier and Scotch tape, would seem to be useless this time, and people desperate for word from sons, daughters, parents or friends are turning to a different kind of lamppost. ''I really need to find my Dad,'' read a posting on Craigslist.com, a Web site better known as a place to buy or sell or rent, or look for love. The ''lost and found'' link for the New Orleans Craigslist, normally little used, was flooded yesterday with what is becoming the Hurricane Katrina version of an old-fashioned missing poster. ''I think some of them are being read,'' said Ava Dezara, 31, who posted the note looking for her father. ''There's so many of them, I really don't know.'' A native of the devastated Ninth Ward of New Orleans, she lives in Reno, Nev., and has not heard from her father, who still lives in the neighborhood. ''I've heard from my sister. Neither she nor I have heard from my dad,'' she said by telephone yesterday as she scrolled down the growing Craigslist page. ''Oh, my goodness, there's tons of them.'' Under the heading ''Submit Your Own Stories'' on the Times-Picayune newspaper's Web site, www.nola.com, were similar messages, reminiscent of the missing posters that fluttered in New York City after the Sept. 11 attacks and throughout Indonesia after the tsunami last year. But in addition, the newspaper created another category: People Needing Rescue. Dozens of people have posted notices begging the authorities to rescue their relatives from attics or buildings where they are believed to be trapped. ''Please help,'' one read. ''About 400-500 people are gathered at the church on 5069 Willowbrook Drive, 70129 ZIP and are waiting for help. They have no food and water is rising. Please help.'' The author, Trang Nguyen, 28, posted the note from Arlington, Tex., yesterday afternoon, and said a few hours later that she had not heard any good news yet. ''They're still there,'' said Ms. Nguyen, whose parents know people from the church. ''They've been swimming around, gathering each other in the church area.'' She said she tried to call the authorities, but could not get through and so turned to the Internet. ''That was the only way.'' In Indianapolis, Angelnet Johnson, 33, a New Orleans native, said she believed she had better luck getting help for her brother at his home on South Galvez Street. She posted a note yesterday morning on Craigslist, and when she spoke again to her brother, whose phone was working, he told her that help was on the way, she said. ''And when I called back two hours later, it just rang,'' she said. ''I think it must have helped. I just was hoping. I figured if I left it at a news station, that some reporter or somebody would forward it to the search and rescue people.'' There is no way to tell if the postings are working, short of anecdotes. Alex Kehr started a new Web site yesterday devoted to posts for the missing, findkatrina.com. By yesterday evening, the site had almost 500 postings, many with thumbnail pictures of the missing. ''I am actually about to start programming a part of the site that allows people to post their success stories,'' the site's creator wrote in an e-mail message yesterday. ''So far I have not heard any stories of people finding loved ones because of Find Katrina. That might be because the site opened today, though.'' At Craigslist, some links normally devoted to romantic, personals-ad-style connections, like men and women looking for someone they met in a bar or locked eyes with on a subway, also carried notices for the missing. Other links, like the more-risqué ''casual encounters,'' included two postings yesterday from men apparently looking to turn the hurricane into an opportunity for a date. ''I will give you free shelter in New York and pay for you to get here,'' said a man identifying himself only as a 25-year-old on Long Island. ''I will help you get back on your feet. You can come stay with me if you are a young attractive female that has just lost everything in the hurricane. I live on Long Island and I am willing to open my home to you.'' Perhaps less than altruistically, he added, ''Please send pic.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE MISSING"
"Hurricanes come in two waves. First comes the rainstorm, and then comes what the historian John Barry calls the ''human storm'' -- the recriminations, the political conflict and the battle over compensation. Floods wash away the surface of society, the settled way things have been done. They expose the underlying power structures, the injustices, the patterns of corruption and the unacknowledged inequalities. When you look back over the meteorological turbulence in this nation's history, it's striking how often political turbulence followed. In 1889 in Pennsylvania, a great flood washed away much of Johnstown. The water's crushing destruction sounded to one person like a ''lot of horses grinding oats.'' Witnesses watched hundreds of people trapped on a burning bridge, forced to choose between burning to death or throwing themselves into the churning waters to drown. The flood was so abnormal that the country seemed to have trouble grasping what had happened. The national media were filled with wild exaggerations and fabrications: stories of rivers dammed with corpses, of children who died while playing ring-around-the-rosy and who were found with their hands still clasped and with smiles still on their faces. Prejudices were let loose. Hungarians then were akin to today's illegal Mexican immigrants -- hard-working people who took jobs no one else wanted. Newspapers carried accounts of gangs of Hungarian men cutting off dead women's fingers to steal their rings. ''Drunken Hungarians, Dancing, Singing, Cursing and Fighting Amid the Ruins'' a New York Herald headline blared. Then, as David McCullough notes in ''The Johnstown Flood,'' public fury turned on the Pittsburgh millionaires whose club's fishing pond had emptied on the town. The Chicago Herald depicted the millionaires as Roman aristocrats, seeking pleasure while the poor died like beasts in the Coliseum. Even before the flood, public resentment was building against the newly rich industrialists. Protests were growing against the trusts, against industrialization and against the new concentrations of wealth. The Johnstown flood crystallized popular anger, for the fishing club was indeed partly to blame. Public reaction to the disaster helped set the stage for the progressive movement and the trust-busting that was to come. In 1900, another great storm hit the U.S., killing over 6,000 people in Galveston, Tex. The storm exposed racial animosities, for this time stories (equally false) swept through the press accusing blacks of cutting off the fingers of corpses to steal wedding rings. The devastation ended Galveston's chance to beat out Houston as Texas' leading port. Then in 1927, the great Mississippi flood rumbled down upon New Orleans. As Barry writes in his account, ''Rising Tide,'' the disaster ripped the veil off the genteel, feudal relations between whites and blacks, and revealed the festering iniquities. Blacks were rounded up into work camps and held by armed guards. They were prevented from leaving as the waters rose. A steamer, the Capitol, played ''Bye Bye Blackbird'' as it sailed away. The racist violence that followed the floods helped persuade many blacks to move north. Civic leaders intentionally flooded poor and middle-class areas to ease the water's pressure on the city, and then reneged on promises to compensate those whose homes were destroyed. That helped fuel the populist anger that led to Huey Long's success. Across the country people demanded that the federal government get involved in disaster relief, helping to set the stage for the New Deal. The local civic elite turned insular and reactionary, and New Orleans never really recovered its preflood vibrancy. We'd like to think that the stories of hurricanes and floods are always stories of people rallying together to give aid and comfort. And, indeed, each of America's great floods has prompted a popular response both generous and inspiring. But floods are also civic examinations. Amid all the stories that recur with every disaster -- tales of sudden death and miraculous survival, the displacement and the disease -- there is also the testing. Civic arrangements work or they fail. Leaders are found worthy or wanting. What's happening in New Orleans and Mississippi today is a human tragedy. But take a close look at the people you see wandering, devastated, around New Orleans: they are predominantly black and poor. The political disturbances are still to come.

"As ports remained closed from Louisiana to Florida on Wednesday, some 300 barges containing grains and other products were left homeless. Under the management of Cargill, a large agriculture producer and exporter, the barges were caught in a bottleneck caused by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Now they are floating on rivers north of New Orleans with nowhere to go. Two days after one of the worst storms ever ravaged the Gulf Coast, large parts of the nation's distribution system were feeling the effects. Major transportation arteries were clogged, and imports and exports had slowed to a crawl. The logistical logjam could delay the production of hundreds of everyday products. The result is that consumers, even those far from the storm's epicenter, might have to pay more for everything from coffee and bananas to paint and tires. Many of the Cargill barges, for example, were loaded with corn, soybeans and wheat, for shipment out of the country, before the storm struck early Monday. With the harvest season for grain less than a month away, grain processors said they were concerned over how long shipping would remain constrained before they must begin their busiest export time of the year, to Europe and Asia. Grains are the largest export likely to be affected by the devastation to the ports, because they are so dependent on the river barge system. In July, about half of the country's grain exports were shipped from the Mississippi River gulf outlet, said David D. Lehman, managing director for commodities at the Chicago Board of Trade. ''Those facilities are all without power and could be impacted by the flooding,'' he said. ''If this is a 5- to 10-day problem, it won't significantly impact the grain markets,'' Mr. Lehman said. If it is longer, then importers will start switching to buying from other ports, mostly likely along the West Coast. But with gasoline and diesel prices being sharply affected by the loss of refining capacity caused by the storm, shifting to other ports will create costly logistical complications that will probably be passed to consumers in the form of higher prices, shipping firms said. David Feider, a spokesman for Cargill, said it was ''not feasible'' to divert grain shipments to trucks or trains because of the high cost and the loading infrastructure required. Imports are not faring any better. Shippers were scrambling to arrange alternative ports for incoming shipments of oil, chemicals and steel additives. Millions of pounds of coffee remained in storage in New Orleans. ''Everything is at a standstill right now,'' Mr. Feider said. Government officials struggled Wednesday to assess the scope of the damage to the port of New Orleans. Coast Guard officials said that they were finishing underwater surveys of shipping channels. So far they have found an unusual amount of soil and sand build-up, and a number of buoys and other navigational aides either missing, destroyed or misplaced, creating the potential for ships to run aground, said Petty Officer John Miller, a Coast Guard spokesman. Some ships struggled with the question of whether to divert to other ports. The Port of Houston Authority said it was receiving inquiries from carriers about possible diversions. A cargo ship laden with rubber and timber, originally slated to make calls at New Orleans and Pascagoula, Miss., was diverted to Houston Wednesday night, the port authority said. Chiquita Brands International said it had no choice but to reroute shipments of bananas and other fresh produce to ports like Freeport, Tex., and Port Everglades, Fla. Chiquita's facilities in Gulfport, Miss., which last year handled about 25 percent of its banana imports to the United States from Central America, were too damaged to receive shipments, the company said. Meanwhile, companies struggled to get products out of New Orleans. More than 700,000 bags of coffee, each weighing 132 or 150 pounds, remained in storage in New Orleans, said the Chicago Board of Trade. Procter & Gamble said it suffered a heavy loss of coffee production. About half of its Folgers brand of coffee comes out of New Orleans. The facility has been shut since Saturday, and Doug O. Shelton, a Procter spokesman, said the company had no idea when it could reopen. ''We're still in the process of trying to re-establish contact with the people who worked in the area,'' he said. In recent years, ports in Long Beach, Calif., and in the Pacific Northwest became so congested that some companies began importing container shipments of consumer products directly from Asia to gulf ports to more easily distribute to customers in the South and Midwest. Wal-Mart opened a mammoth distribution center outside Houston this summer as part of a direct-import strategy. Christi Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the company, said that while two distribution centers were affected by the storm, the Houston facility and Wal-Mart's many other distribution centers spared the company any major disruptions. Others were not so lucky. Damage was so heavy at one of DuPont's largest titanium dioxide plants, which supplies whiteners and brighteners to paint and coatings manufacturers, and to a plant that makes a chemical precursor to the polyurethane foams used in car dashboards and appliances, that the company has invoked legal clauses used to shield itself from liabilities when it inevitably has to renege on some supply contracts. ''It's too early to say how much we've lost, but we've had extensive flooding,'' said Kelli Kukura, a DuPont spokeswoman. Truckers are also feeling the effects. Shipments in and out of the New Orleans region represent about $1 million a day for Yellow Roadway, a $10 billion trucking company, ''and since commerce in the area has pretty much stopped, it will affect those revenues,'' said William D. Zollars, the chairman. But Mr. Zollars is more concerned about costs than revenues. Yellow Roadway has 20 terminals in the area. ''Our terminal in New Orleans has been reduced to a concrete slab, and with communications so bad, we don't know how much damage we've had at others,'' he said. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE PORTS"
"Public officials and educators reached out yesterday to offer classroom space to students whose public schools and colleges and universities were shut down by Hurricane Katrina. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas invited students from Louisiana and Mississippi left homeless by the hurricane to enroll in any of his state's 7,000 public schools. Some Texas school districts reported that they were already receiving inquiries from storm refugees yesterday, state officials said. ''I want those stranded families to know that the doors of Texas public schools are going to be immediately open to their school-age children,'' Governor Perry said in a televised address. Federal law entitles homeless students to enroll in any school district in the country, just by showing up. Cecil J. Picard, the Louisiana state superintendent of education, urged school districts that were largely unaffected by the storm to enroll homeless students. Louisiana has 727,000 children in public schools, and Mr. Picard said the storm had displaced 135,000 of them. He urged teachers displaced by the storm to apply for work in the districts where they have taken shelter, and called on businesses and churches to provide temporary classrooms. The storm severely damaged many colleges and universities, displacing perhaps 100,000 students or more for the fall semester, officials estimated. New Orleans is home to several institutions of higher learning, including Tulane University, the University of New Orleans, Southern University of New Orleans, Xavier University, Loyola University of New Orleans, Our Lady of Holy Cross College and Dillard University, as well as Louisiana State University's medical school. Both the American Council on Education, the nation's largest association of colleges and universities, and the American Association of Universities, which includes 62 of the nation's leading research institutions, including Tulane, urged their member institutions yesterday to help displaced students. And universities and colleges around the nation said they were making efforts to help. For example, the University of Virginia was working to accommodate Virginia students who had been enrolled in New Orleans area institutions, it said in a statement. Vanderbilt University will try to enroll the displaced as ''visiting students,'' said Michael J. Schoenfeld, Vanderbilt's vice chancellor for public affairs. In New York, Iona College in New Rochelle enrolled several Tulane students yesterday, said Meghan Finn, an Iona spokeswoman. Syracuse University said it would enroll Tulane students at no charge, on a temporary basis, until Tulane reopens, the university said in a statement. And John R. Ryan, acting chancellor of the State University of New York, urged the presidents of SUNY's 64 four-year and community college campuses to enroll and house students displaced in the storm. Much of Tulane's senior staff and some 400 students were evacuated Sunday to Jackson State University in Mississippi, Tulane's president, Scott Cowen, announced in messages posted on the university's Web site. Dr. Cowen reported that the damaged campus was likely to be repaired ''in a reasonable period of time,'' but did not estimate when the university might reopen. At Dillard University, where the fall term began on Aug. 22, President Marvalene Hughes ordered the campus evacuated on Saturday. Some 225 Dillard students fled New Orleans, heading north in a convoy of buses, one of which developed a mechanical problem and burned up en route, destroying students' belongings, Dr. Hughes said. The students arrived Sunday in Shreveport, where they were given refuge in the gymnasium of Centenary College, said Kenneth L. Schwab, Centenary's president said. Some Dillard students have since departed by plane and bus to homes in various parts of the country, Dr. Schwab said. HURRICANE KATRINA: SCHOOLS Correction: September 2, 2005, Friday An article yesterday about the impact of Hurricane Katrina on schools and colleges misstated the name and composition of an association of research universities that has urged its members to help displaced students. It is the Association of American Universities, not the American Association of Universities. Two of its 62 members are in Canada; they are not all in the United States."
"Not since he sat in a Florida classroom as the World Trade Center burned a thousand miles away has President Bush faced a test quite like the one he returned to Washington to confront this afternoon. After initially stumbling through that disorienting day almost exactly four years ago, Mr. Bush entered what many of his aides believe were the finest hours of his presidency. But unlike 2001, when Mr. Bush was freshly elected and there was little question that the response would include a military strike, Mr. Bush confronts this disaster with his political capital depleted by the war in Iraq. Even before Hurricane Katrina, governors were beginning to question whether National Guard units stretched to the breaking point by service in Iraq would be available for domestic emergencies. Those concerns have now been amplified by scenes of looting and disorder. There is also the added question of whether the Department of Homeland Security, designed primarily to fight terrorism, can cope with what Mr. Bush called Wednesday ''one of the worst natural disasters in our country's history.'' All this has inextricably linked Mr. Bush's foreign agenda, especially Iraq, to the issue of how well he manages the federal response to the monumental problems in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Mr. Bush knows the risks. He saw up close the political damage done to his father 13 years ago this week, when the senior Mr. Bush was dispatching fighter jets to maintain a no-fly zone over parts of Iraq and promoting his trade agenda while 250,000 Floridians were reeling from the impact of Hurricane Andrew. But the current president, in contrast, prides himself as a crisis manager. He observed in a debate with Vice President Al Gore in 2000 that natural catastrophes were ''a time to test your mettle.'' The next few weeks will determine whether he can manage several challenges at once, in the chaos of Iraq and the humanitarian and economic fallout along the Gulf Coast. Success could help him emerge from a troubled moment in his presidency, when his approval ratings have hit an all-time low. But it is hardly assured. His first challenge is to show that both his reconfigured government and the National Guard units can perform on both fronts. Mr. Bush, his aides pointed out Wednesday, declared a disaster even before the storm hit, enabling the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy early. But while the National Guard was called in quickly, there are already questions about whether the aid would be swifter if deployments to Iraq were not so intense: Mississippi has 3,800 Guard troops in Iraq, and Louisiana has about 3,000. That leaves more than 60 percent of their Guard still in the state, which Joseph M. Allbaugh, one of Mr. Bush's closest friends and his first head of FEMA, said in an interview Wednesday should be plenty for the challenge ahead. ''If anyone is telling you that Iraq is getting in the way, well that's hogwash,'' Mr. Allbaugh said from Baton Rouge, where he was clinging to a bad cellphone connection while trying to help muster private industry to aid in the disaster relief. The longer-term risk is that the storm's aftermath will push gasoline prices to a breaking point -- something Mr. Bush alluded to Wednesday when he warned that ''our citizens must understand this storm has disrupted the capacity to make gasoline and distribute gasoline.'' Even before returning to Washington, Mr. Bush approved loans from the country's Strategic Oil Reserve. But that is at best a short-term measure, and should prices continue to rise, Mr. Bush will inevitably confront the question of whether his administration was ill prepared to absorb an oil shock at a time of conflict in the Middle East. Mr. Bush's instinctive response to such moments, his longtime aides and friends say, is to set up measurements to determine whether his efforts are adequately addressing a problem. ''He likes being a hands-on manager,'' said Mr. Allbaugh. ''He wants numbers, he wants to be able to show that the ball is moving down the field.'' That was evident Wednesday in the Rose Garden, when Mr. Bush started ticking off statistics on the number of people rescued, the numbers of meals-ready-to-eat that have been delivered, the number of people already in shelters. It is reminiscent of how Mr. Bush has argued that progress is being made in Iraq. But as the administration has learned in Iraq, the imagery of violent chaos, repeated over and over, can undercut even the most frequently cited statistics. And so Mr. Bush's biggest risk may be an inability to control circumstances that are beyond his ability to shape from Washington. ''The great thing about this president is that he doesn't try to use tragedy to gain immediate attention for himself,'' said Bob Martinez, a former governor of Florida who has endured his share of hurricanes and other disasters. ''He talks to those with knowledge, and then he acts.'' But now, he said, ''there needs to be a powerful message to the country to energize the help,'' a message Mr. Bush plans to amplify, his aides say, when he visits the stricken areas, probably Friday or Saturday. Mr. Martinez noted that ''the risk is that there is sometimes a big disconnect between you when you speak and when bottles of water end up in people's hands.'' That may be a more complicated problem in this disaster, veterans of such operations warn, than it was after 9/11. Mr. Allbaugh noted that for all the horror of that day, the immediate damage was confined to ''16 acres in New York'' and part of the Pentagon, and ''here you have hundreds of thousands of square miles'' of misery. And the problems in the region will vary tremendously, from caring for the newly homeless in New Orleans to wiped-out ports along the coast. HURRICANE KATRINA: NEWS ANALYSIS"
"For the first time since the 1970's, gasoline lines reappeared yesterday in some corners of the country. Three days after Hurricane Katrina dealt a devastating blow to the nation's largest energy hub, the worst-case possibility was quickly becoming a reality: gasoline prices surging well above $3 a gallon, with some consumers complaining of price gouging; service stations in a handful of locations running out of gas; drivers rushing to fill their tanks, only to find themselves waiting in line with others. After the sudden drop in oil supplies, gasoline sellers were quick to raise their prices. While gasoline averaged $2.60 a gallon earlier in the week, unleaded regular gas was selling yesterday at $3.09 at stations in West Palm Beach, Fla.; $3.49 in Indianapolis; and $3.25 in San Francisco. Premium fuel was going for up to $3.89 a gallon in Chicago. Shortages and gasoline lines were reported in parts of South Carolina, the Dakotas, Arkansas and Kentucky. The White House responded yesterday by saying it would release oil from the nation's emergency stockpiles to meet shortages and would relax environmental standards nationwide so that refiners could produce more -- but dirtier -- gasoline. ''A lot of crude production has been shut down because of the storm,'' President Bush said outside the White House yesterday after returning from his vacation in Texas. ''Our citizens must understand this storm has disrupted the capacity to make gasoline and to distribute gasoline.'' In response to the White House announcement, the price of crude oil fell in trading yesterday to $68.94, from $69.81, and the stock market rose as traders looked for signs of relief. Still, most analysts said that neither move by the federal government was likely to produce much gasoline in the short term or bring prices down anytime soon. The problem is not any immediate shortage of crude oil but rather that crucial oil product pipelines and refineries in the gulf region are unable to operate. The impact from the hurricane is likely to be felt nationwide for months. Some economists suggest that the disruptions could shave at least one percentage point from a fourth-quarter growth rate that most analysts, until the disaster, expected to reach roughly 3 percent. Moreover, if oil prices remain around $70 a barrel or higher, they could put the Federal Reserve in an increasingly unpleasant position, caught between the desire to keep inflation low and the pressure to prevent an economic downturn. The storm, which submerged New Orleans after it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, crippled substantial portions of the country's energy infrastructure. In Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, electrical power was out, refineries were drowned, and most of the offshore production of oil and gas had not resumed. While crude oil prices fell, gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange soared for a third day as traders and analysts tried to determine the severity and duration of the supply disruptions. Gasoline futures -- equivalent to wholesale prices before taxes, distribution and marketing costs -- closed at $2.6145 a gallon yesterday, a gain of 5.7 percent. On Tuesday, they jumped 20 percent. Energy industry officials said the sharp jump in prices was an inevitable market reaction to fears that the only way to balance continued strong demand with tighter supplies was through higher prices, which would serve to keep some drivers from taking extra trips. They said price controls would only make the situation worse by discouraging production. The government started receiving reports of price gouging at the retail level and said the complaints would be turned over to the Federal Trade Commission for investigation. ''We have gotten a number of people concerned about the prices,'' said Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the Energy Department. And Reuters reported that Georgia's governor, Sonny Perdue, signed an order to punish gasoline sellers who gouge customers, amid complaints that prices in some cases had risen to $5 a gallon. Mark N. Cooper, the research director with the Consumer Federation of America, said the issue was not gouging. ''This is the result of the complete and total neglect of the petroleum industry,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''Refiners are vulnerable, overstretched and not very competitive. Gouging is not the problem. It's a symptom of an underlying disease.'' Throughout the South and Midwest, service stations were beginning to experience some shortages in areas where gasoline is usually transported by pipeline from the gulf. Nearly two million barrels a day of refining capacity has been knocked out by the storm and could take weeks to return. ''There are risks of pockets of shortages in various parts of the country,'' said Edward L. Morse, an executive adviser at Hetco, a New York-based oil trading company. ''There should be no gasoline lines in New York and New England, or California, but inland markets, like parts of Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky or Missouri, Memphis and Atlanta, are vulnerable.'' ''Lines are hard to predict,'' Mr. Morse said, because they typically occur ''when consumers want to top off their tanks because they're afraid of gas lines.'' Some drivers in Illinois, for example, rushed to service stations and formed gas lines because they heard on the radio that shortages were developing, only adding to a sense of panic that feeds on itself. In other cases, drivers topped their tanks in anticipation of the Labor Day weekend. In parts of South Carolina and a few other places, lines formed because of credible reports that gasoline was in short supply. ''It's obviously very serious,'' said Guy F. Caruso, the administrator of the Energy Information Administration. ''But given time and the industry's proven ability to respond to natural disasters, it will be resolved. Clearly, in the meantime, there will be economic pain.'' In North Carolina, Gov. Mike Easley said the state had only one week of gasoline supplies and some stations were already running out of fuel. ''We are not out of gas, but we are running low,'' Mr. Easley said. In South Carolina, prices topped $3 a gallon for the first time as lines formed at some gas stations. ''This reminds me of the 70's,'' said Ernie Adams, 70, a vacuum cleaner salesman from Union, S.C., who was filling up at a station where several cars lined up at each of the station's 16 pumps. ''I burn a lot of gas, and I was hoping I'd never see anything like that again.'' According to weekly estimates released yesterday, gasoline stocks in the United States totaled 194 million barrels, enough to satisfy demand for more than 20 days. Sims Floyd Jr., the executive director of the South Carolina Petroleum Marketers Association, said the worst was yet to come. ''We're facing a severe supply shortage very soon.'' The Mississippi Delta sits in the middle of a network of pipelines that feed markets as far away as New Jersey and Illinois. Last year, the entire gulf region shipped 4.5 million barrels a day of products to other parts of the country, according to the American Petroleum Institute -- most of it by pipelines and the rest by tanker or barges. Pipelines transport 1.9 million barrels a day of crude to refineries in the Midwest. As many as 10 refiners have formally requested or informally contacted the government about using oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which currently holds about 700 million barrels of crude, according to Mr. Stevens, the Energy Department spokesman. He declined to identify them until their requests had been approved. But one company whose loan was accepted on Tuesday evening rescinded its request yesterday afternoon. The problem is that no active refiners are in a position to increase their production to make up for the lost output from storm-damaged refineries. ''It doesn't matter that the government opens the strategic reserves because there is very little slack in the refining business,'' said Craig Pennington, the director of the global energy group at Schroders in London. Rising prices, meanwhile, are inevitably turning into a hot political issue. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, criticized the Bush administration for not moving sooner to tap the oil reserve: ''On energy, Americans were expecting a lot more from the president,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''He took a tiny baby step when a giant step is required.'' But others said the problem came from decades of underinvestment and a shortage of refining capacity. ''This hurricane is a wake-up call that we need to do things across the board on infrastructure and to also expand the base,'' said Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ''It's time to not only rebuild what we have, but it's, in my opinion, time to build additional resources so we're not as stressed as we've been.'' More than 90 percent of the gulf's daily oil output -- or 1.37 million barrels -- remained closed yesterday, while natural gas production was down by 83 percent, or 8.3 billion cubic feet, according to the Minerals Management Service, a unit of the Department of Interior. Coast Guard crews reported that up to 20 rigs and platforms had either sunk or were adrift, Larry Chambers, a public information officer, said. At least one gas rig has caught fire. The Mars platform of Royal Dutch Shell -- which alone accounts for 15 percent of the gulf's oil production -- is ''severely damaged,'' the Coast Guard said in a release. Some relief might come from more imports of gasoline from Europe. The Environmental Protection Agency relaxed pollution standards nationwide to allow the use of lower grades of gasoline. Earlier the agency had relaxed standards in the four states most affected by Hurricane Katrina: Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Industry experts expect suppliers from Europe to help fill the gap. But it will not happen overnight. ''The United States is the highest-price market in the world right now, and that will attract European products in large flows,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ''That's undeniable. Price is the magnet.'' ''But we have a liquidity crisis,'' he added. ''We need to create supply instantaneously.'' Much of the problem with gasoline supplies is psychological, for consumers as well as investors. Markets were initially calmed by reports that one large pipeline concern, Kinder Morgan, had indicated that its Plantation pipeline, running from New Orleans to the East Coast, was undamaged and expected to resume operating by Tuesday. Then, Kinder Morgan unexpectedly pushed back the start-up date for the pipeline, which is capable of 620,000 barrels a day, to yesterday. Then it said there was no clear resumption date. Some energy industry strategists were adamant that market forces would prevent gasoline lines from forming. Others were not so sure. ''I hate to be an alarmist, but we're in a situation without much precedent,'' said David Pursell, a principal with Pickering Energy Partners in Houston. ''With the gasoline market as tight as it is, people complain about $3 gas but they'll put $5 gas in their car if they suddenly think it's not available.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE OIL SUPPLY"
"The sick and the disabled were the first to be led out. But late Wednesday afternoon, as the slow evacuation of the Superdome began, it was not always easy to distinguish them from the rest of the 20,000 or more storm refugees who had steeped for days in the arena's sickening heat and stench, unbathed, exhausted and hungry. They had been crammed into the Superdome's shadowy ramps and corridors, spread across its vast artificial turf field and plopped into small family encampments in the plush orange, teal and purple seats that rise toward the top of the dome. They had flocked to the arena seeking sanctuary from the winds and waters of Hurricane Katrina. But understaffed, undersupplied and without air-conditioning or even much lighting, the domed stadium quickly became a sweltering and surreal vault, a place of overflowing toilets and no showers. Food and water, blankets and sheets, were in short supply. And the dome's reluctant residents exchanged horror stories, including reports, which could not be confirmed by the authorities, of a suicide and of rapes. By Wednesday the stink was staggering. Heaps of rotting garbage in bulging white plastic bags baked under a blazing Louisiana sun on the main entry plaza, choking new arrivals as they made their way into the stadium after being plucked off rooftops and balconies. The odor billowing from toilets was even fouler. Trash spilled across corridors and aisles, slippery with smelly mud and scraps of food. ''They're housing us like animals,'' said Iiesha Rousell, 31, unemployed after four years in the Army in Germany, dripping with perspiration in the heat, unable to contain her fury and disappointment at being left with only National Guardsmen as overseers and no information about what might lie ahead. Once inside the dome, refugees were told that for their own safety they could not leave -- the flood waters climbed four feet up the walls outside -- and many likened the shelter to a prison. Michael Childs, 45 and a housepainter, went a step further. ''It's worse than a prison,'' said Mr. Childs, who knew something about the subject, having spent three months in the Orleans Parish Prison on a drunken-driving charge. ''In prison you have a place to urinate, a place for other bathroom needs. Here you get no water, no toilets, no lights. You get all that in prison.'' On Wednesday afternoon, federal emergency management workers and National Guardsmen began escorting the sickest residents out of the arena. By late evening, when the evacuation paused, 700 people had been removed from the dome. The authorities said they were being taken to other places in the state. Officials said they hoped to resume their work on Thursday, using hundreds of school buses and municipal buses to take the rest of the refugees to the Astrodome in Houston, on a ride lasting more than six hours. Rest stops were planned at Baton Rouge, Lake Charles and Beaumont, Tex. If there was little comfort in the prospect of trading one sports arena for another, there was hope waiting in Houston, where Texas officials promised showers, food, medical care and perhaps most important, the freedom to come and go through a system of passes. At a news conference, Judge Robert Eckels, chief executive of Harris County, which owns the Astrodome, offered assurances that it was ''not a jail.'' At the center of the dome, the field looked like a sprawling military aid station, littered with casualties from a major battle. Families huddled together on scraps of cardboard and torn sheets of vinyl ripped off the lower walls of the stadium. A few stretched out on cots. Piled beside them were plastic shopping bags and suitcases, holding a few clothes. Some people had arrived with nothing more than what they were wearing. A humid, dusky haze hung over the football field, pierced by three angular shafts of light, as if from an old biblical movie, streaming through holes that the storm tore in the rubbery white fabric covering the dome. Desperation was in the air. Danielle Shelby tugged at a reporter's arm. ''I have a handicapped daughter,'' she said. ''She's over there with her wheelchair. She's hot. We don't have any water. I'm afraid she's going to have a seizure.'' Others crowded around. ''I've been in the food line twice, and every time I get to the front they tell me they don't have any left,'' said Juanita McFerrin, 80. ''My husband has cancer,'' another woman said. ''He's not getting his regular treatment.'' Frank L. Jones, 54, said he had gone four days without his asthma medicine. Lionel Valentine, 53, who breathes with the help of an oxygen machine, wanted to know if his family would be split up again as they were moved from the dome. It got worse. Ms. Rousell recalled hearing a loud bang Tuesday afternoon as the body of a man slapped the concrete at the edge of the football field in a fatal suicidal plunge, after he apparently learned that his home had been destroyed. Others told of fights that broke out in food lines, and of a husband and wife who slugged each other in a wild argument. Several residents said they had heard of children being raped, though it was not clear whether anyone reported such incidents to the authorities, and no officials could be found who could confirm the accounts. Darcel Monroe, 21, a bakery cashier, stammered hysterically as she recounted seeing two young girls being raped in one of the women's bathrooms. ''A lot of people saw it but they were afraid to do anything,'' she said. ''He ran out past all of us.'' Many said they felt they had been dumped and abandoned in the stadium. There were no television sets to allow them to follow the rescue efforts, or learn when they might get out. ''One guard would say we're going, another would say we're not,'' said Malachi Johnson, 23, a forklift operator. ''One says the water is rising, another says the water is going down. We don't know what to believe.'' As the storm struck early Monday, families were often separated. Some took shelter, while others stayed behind to guard houses. Still others decided the hurricane would not be that serious and ended up being rescued. But no one was helping families reunite, they said. Brenda Smith, 42, a homemaker, said she had been unable to find her teenage daughters, Britney and Jessica. They had gone to stay with a sister of Ms. Smith's in a housing project that had been surrounded by floodwaters. ''I know they were in the project, and I know that the project was evacuated,'' Ms. Smith said. ''But I don't know where they are, and I don't know who to talk to. I've walked around the whole Superdome twice.'' She was eager to get out of the dome, Ms. Smith said, but not looking forward to being shipped to some distant holding center. ''I would like to know something about my daughters before I go anywhere,'' she said, as she rested her head on a scrap of cardboard near the 35-yard line. Kiki Bell, who is 29 and manages two shops, one selling lace, the other offering herbal remedies, worried about being sent away from New Orleans. ''What's going to happen to our jobs?'' she asked. ''How can we take care of our families?'' Teenagers stuck in the dome tried to make the best of it. Two pickup squads of about 20 players, shirtless and barefoot, battled in a rather loosely structured game of touch football Wednesday afternoon, ignoring the heat. Some of the boys took the barrel-like foam rubber padding off one of the goalposts and turned it into a tackling dummy, crashing into it with powerful, smashing lunges. The younger children found their own diversions. Around the 30-yard line, two cousins, Ken Juan Smith, 2, and Joseph M. Smith, 3, chased each other in meandering circles, shrieking when they collided and later playing catch with empty plastic water bottles. No one in the dome seemed happy. But some were able to overcome their discomfort, frustration and anger to reflect on the larger issue of having survived. ''I just thank God,'' said Ms. Smith, who despaired at finding her daughters before taken to some far-away shelter. ''This has been awful. But it's better than being out there in the wind and the rain and that rising water.'' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE SUPERDOME"
"After struggling with enormous logistical problems trying to cover the calamity caused by Hurricane Katrina, television news organizations moved yesterday onto what one executive called a ''war footing.'' That description, from a CNN senior vice president, Jack Womack, reflected the widespread view among news executives that the problems they have faced this week in documenting the damage to the Gulf Coast have been far tougher than anything experienced covering the war in Iraq or the tsunami that hit Southeast Asia last December. ''This really does remind me of covering a war zone or a third world story,'' said John Stack, the vice president of newsgathering for the Fox News Channel. The news channels have scrambled against impediments like widespread power failures, disrupted cellphone service, and lack of fuel to maintain contact with correspondents and news crews, while also struggling to keep them supplied with food, water and shelter. Yesterday, they began sending in relief crews and setting up supply lines. The broadcast networks also raised the visibility of their coverage in prime time, with ABC, CBS and NBC all scheduling hourlong specials after several days during which they broadcast only hourly updates in the evenings. Mr. Womack said that one of CNN's main problems had been finding ways to recharge technical equipment. ''We had been using car batteries,'' he said. ''But now most of them are under water.'' Many news organizations surveyed surrounding areas to find recreational vehicles that could be used as both supply carriers and air-conditioned shelter for crews. Mr. Womack said CNN had leased every such vehicle it could find in the Atlanta area. NBC rented recreational vehicles from all over Texas, filled them with food and water, and drove them toward New Orleans. Paul Slavin, senior vice president of ABC News, said communications began to improve yesterday, but he recounted difficulty in getting satellite trucks past the numerous police and military checkpoints on roads leading to New Orleans. Steve Capus, the senior vice president of NBC News, said one of its trucks ''died in the water'' after its tires were blown out when it rode over a fallen light pole in New Orleans. Marcy McGinnis, senior vice president of news coverage for CBS, said that the networks had expected to have communications problems in Iraq and planned for them. ''We thought of every contingency in that case,'' Ms. McGinnis said. The hurricane fooled everyone, she said, because the flooding took place just when it seemed that the worst was over. The networks found themselves inadequately equipped, especially with satellite phones, for a place with no electrical power. The NBC News anchor Brian Williams, who is the most prominent network news personality in New Orleans, has been able to maintain only infrequent communication with his headquarters in New York, Mr. Capus said. Mr. Williams has anchored the news from New Orleans each night since Sunday after being able to speak with the news desk only a couple of times each day. CBS has had John Roberts co-anchoring the news from New Orleans. One of Fox's main anchors, Shepherd Smith, anchored his program from a highway overpass crowded with displaced people from city housing projects. Diane Sawyer of ABC secured an exclusive interview with President Bush about the disaster; it was to be broadcast on ''Good Morning, America'' this morning. Viewership for the cable news channels has soared. Fox's prime-time audience climbed to 4.2 million on Tuesday night, 112 percent above its Tuesday average, according to Nielsen Media Research. CNN had 3.7 million viewers, an increase of 336 percent. MSNBC had 1.5 million viewers, 379 percent above its average. Audiences for the broadcast networks' regular evening newscasts were also up. As usual, Mr. Williams of NBC led the pack, with 11.3 million viewers on Tuesday night, up from 8 million the week before. ABC had 9.7 million viewers, up from 7.8 million. CBS had 8.1 million, up from 6.4 million. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE NEWS MEDIA"
"At Rapides Parish Detention Center 3 in Alexandria, which normally holds convicted felons, there are now 200 new inmates who arrived hot, hungry and exhausted on buses this week after being evacuated from flooded jails in New Orleans. They have no paperwork indicating whether they are charged with having too much to drink or attempted murder. There is no judge to hear their cases, no courthouse designated to hear them in and no lawyer to represent them. If lawyers can be found, there is no mechanism for paying them. The prisoners have had no contact with their families for days and do not know whether they are alive or dead, if their homes do or do not exist. ''It's like taking a jail and shaking it up in a fruit-basket turnover, so no one has any idea who these people are or why they're here,'' said Phyllis Mann, one of several local lawyers who were at the detention center until 11 p.m. Wednesday, trying to collect basic information on the inmates. ''There is no system of any kind for taking care of these people at this point.'' Along with the destruction of homes, neighborhoods and lives, Hurricane Katrina decimated the legal system of the New Orleans region. More than a third of the state's lawyers have lost their offices, some for good. Most computer records will be saved. Many other records will be lost forever. Some local courthouses have been flooded, imperiling a vast universe of files, records and documents. Court proceedings from divorces to murder trials, to corporate litigation, to custody cases will be indefinitely halted and when proceedings resume lawyers will face prodigious -- if not insurmountable -- obstacles in finding witnesses and principals and in recovering evidence. It is an implosion of the legal network not seen since disasters like the Chicago fire of 1871 or the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, events in times so much simpler as to be useless in making much sense of this one. ''There aren't too many catastrophes that have just wiped out entire cities,'' said Robert Gordon, a professor at Yale Law School who teaches legal history. The effects on individual lawyers vary, from large firms that have already been able to find space, contact clients and resume working on cases, to individual lawyers who fear they may never be able to put their practices back together. But the storm has left even prominent lawyers wondering whether they will have anything to go back to. William Rittenberg, former president of the Louisiana Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a lawyer for 35 years in New Orleans, said he had spent the time since the storm living like a gypsy with his wife and two dogs, moving from Columbus, Miss., to Houston to San Antonio. Mr. Rittenberg said that his firm's main client had been the teachers union for the New Orleans schools, but that there is no way to know when or if school will resume this year. ''I really don't know if I have a law practice anymore,'' he said. Some logistical issues are being addressed as the courts scramble to find new places to set up shop. The Louisiana Supreme Court is moving its operations from New Orleans to a circuit court in Baton Rouge. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is moving to Houston, and electronic technology has allowed lawyers and courts to save files and documents in a way that would have been impossible in the past. But the biggest immediate problem is with criminal courts in southern Louisiana, with thousands of detainees awaiting hearings and trials who have been thrust into a legal limbo without courts, trials, or lawyers. So in Alexandria, a city in central Louisiana, in a scene repeated at prisons and jails throughout the state, Ms. Mann said she and other lawyers had interviewed all 200 inmates, and the criminal defense lawyers' organization was painstakingly trying to compile a registry of prisoners and lawyers. The goal is to put them together, though many of the prisoners do not yet have lawyers and many of the lawyers are scattered across the country. Ms. Mann said that some prisoners, no doubt, were accused of serious crimes, but that most had been arrested on misdemeanor charges like drunkenness that typically fill local lockups. Most were either awaiting hearings or had not been able to make bond and were awaiting trial, which, for many, had been set for the day the hurricane hit. ''I talked to one guy who was arrested for reading a tarot card without a permit,'' she said. ''These are mostly poor people. They haven't been in contact with their family. They have no word at all. A lot of them are pretty devastated. You had a lot of grown men breaking down and boohooing when you talked to them. The warden said they hadn't had food or water for two or three days. So a lot of them were just grateful to be out of the sun, in an air-conditioned place where they could find food and a shower and a mattress.'' In addition to the logistical problems of setting up courts, finding a place to meet, and getting judges, lawyers and evidence, a major question looms about how to pay for the defense of indigent detainees. Louisiana has been in a low-grade crisis for years over the issue, and currently two-thirds of the money to defend those too poor to afford lawyers comes from court costs for traffic and parking offenses. But with the evacuation of New Orleans and its environs, none of that money will be available. Legal officials say that without a quick resolution of the problem the state may be forced to apportion cases to public defenders on a level that makes adequate representation impossible or to free prisoners rather than violate their constitutional right to a speedy trial. More than a week after the storm, not all the news is bad. Some law firms, particularly larger ones with offices outside New Orleans, have reorganized with remarkable speed, saving records electronically, finding new space and housing for lawyers in Baton Rouge Lafayette, Houston, or other areas. Lawyers at McGlinchey Stafford, a firm of about 200 lawyers based in New Orleans and with offices in Baton Rouge and other cities, were among the lucky ones. The lawyers, support staff and their families left New Orleans in advance of the storm as partners in its Baton Rouge office worked to find them housing and office space, said Rudy Aguilar, managing partner of the firm. After the storm, Mr. Aguilar said, the firm put two college students whose parents worked for the firm on a plane to Chicago to buy computers for the new office space. The students rented a truck and drove the computers back to Baton Rouge for the new office, which by Labor Day was up and running, he said. Within days, Rick Stanley of Stanley, Flanagan & Reuter, an 11-lawyer litigation firm had people working in borrowed space in offices in Baton Rouge and Lafayette and at homes in Jackson, Miss., and Amarillo, Tex. On Labor Day, Mr. Stanley signed a lease for new space in Baton Rouge on the hood of his car in a Home Depot parking lot. ''The Monday of the storm,'' he said, ''I was in a state of shock, realizing the whole way of life we knew had passed away, and Tuesday I just said we need to get back up and running, and we did.'' And some say, with the perverse logic of the law, Hurricane Katrina -- months from now, when people return home -- will spawn an unimaginable flood of legal issues. Beth Abramson who is organizing pro bono efforts for the state bar anticipates a torrent of legal issues having to do with ruined property, insurance, environmental issues and countless other concerns. Michelle Ghetti, a law professor at the Southern University Law Center in Baton Rouge said some courts and lawyers moved faster than she could have imagined to shift operations and resume business. On the other hand, the legal issues posed by the storm multiply almost daily. ''Someone just mentioned child molesters,'' Ms. Ghetti said. ''There's a registry in which people are supposed to be notified where they are. But for all we know, they're in shelters or being taken into people's homes. ''New things come up every day. I think this storm is going to produce more legal issues and complications than anyone has ever imagined.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE LAWYERS"
"Local police officers began confiscating weapons from civilians in preparation for a forced evacuation of the last holdouts still living here, as President Bush steeled the nation for the grisly scenes of recovering the dead that will unfold in coming days. Police officers and federal law enforcement agents scoured the city carrying assault rifles seeking residents who have holed up to avoid forcible eviction, as well as those who are still considering evacuating voluntarily to escape the city's putrid waters. ''Individuals are at risk of dying,'' said P. Edwin Compass III, the superintendent of the New Orleans police. ''There's nothing more important than the preservation of human life.'' Although it appeared Wednesday night that forced evacuations were beginning, on Thursday the authorities were still looking for those willing to leave voluntarily. The police said that the search was about 80 percent done, and that afterward they would begin enforcing Mayor C. Ray Nagin's order to remove residents by force. Mr. Bush, in Washington, urged the nearly one million people displaced by the storm to contact federal agencies to apply for immediate aid. He praised the outpouring of private charity to the displaced, but said the costs of restoring lives would affect all Americans, as would the horror of the storm's carnage. ''The responsibility of caring for hundreds of thousands of citizens who no longer have homes is going to place many demands on our nation,'' the president said in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. ''We have many difficult days ahead, especially as we recover those who did not survive the storm.'' As Mr. Bush spoke, Vice President Dick Cheney was touring Mississippi and Louisiana, in part as an answer to the critics who have said that the administration responded too slowly and timidly to the epic disaster. At a stop in Gulfport, Miss., a heckler shouted an obscenity at the vice president. Mr. Cheney shrugged it off, saying it was the first such abuse he had heard. Also on Thursday, Congress approved a $51.8 billion package of storm aid, bringing the total to more than $62 billion in a week. The government is now spending $2 billion dollars a day to respond to the disaster. The confirmed death toll in Louisiana remained at 83 on Thursday. Efforts to recover corpses are beginning, although only a handful of bodies have been recovered so far. Official estimates of the death toll in New Orleans are still vague, but 10,000 remains a common figure. Mississippi officials said they had confirmed 196 dead as of Thursday, including 143 in coastal areas, although Gov. Haley Barbour said he expected the toll to rise. ''It would just be a guess, but the 200 or just over 300 we think is a credible and reliable figure,'' the governor said on NBC's ''Today'' show. He also said electricity would be restored by Sunday to most homes and businesses in the state that could receive it. No one would venture a prediction about when the lights would come back on in New Orleans. The water continued to recede slowly in the city 10 days after Hurricane Katrina swept ashore and levees failed at several points, inundating the basin New Orleans sits in. The Army Corps of Engineers has restored to operation 37 of the city's 174 permanent pumps, allowing them to drain 11,000 cubic feet of water per second from the basin. When all the pumps are working, they can remove 81,000 cubic feet of water per second, said Dan Hitchings of the engineering corps. It will be months before the breadth of the devastation from the storm is known. But a report by the Louisiana fisheries department calculated the economic loss to the state's important seafood industry at as much as $1.6 billion over the next 12 months. Louisiana's insurance commissioner, J. Robert Wooley, said the state had barred insurance companies from canceling any homeowner's insurance policies in the days immediately before the storm hit and afterward. ''All cancellations will be voided,'' Mr. Wooley said. Across New Orleans, active-duty soldiers, National Guard members and local law enforcement agencies from across the country continued door-to-door searches by patrol car, Humvee, helicopter and boat, urging remaining residents to leave. Maj. Gen. James Ron Mason of the Kansas National Guard, who commands about 25,000 Guard troops in and around New Orleans, said his forces had rescued 687 residents by helicopter, boat and high-wheeled truck in the past 24 hours. General Mason said Guard troops, although carrying M-16 rifles, would not use force to evict recalcitrant citizens. That, he said, was a job for the police, not members of the Guard. ''I don't believe that you will see National Guard soldiers actually physically forcing people to leave,'' General Mason said. Mr. Compass, the police superintendent, said that after a week of near anarchy in the city, no civilians in New Orleans will be allowed to carry pistols, shotguns, or other firearms of any kind. ''Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons,'' he said. That order apparently does not apply to the hundreds of security guards whom businesses and some wealthy individuals have hired to protect their property. The guards, who are civilians working for private security firms like Blackwater, are openly carrying M-16s and other assault rifles. Mr. Compass said that he was aware of the private guards but that the police had no plans to make them give up their weapons. New Orleans has turned into an armed camp, patrolled by thousands of local, state, and federal law enforcement officers, as well as National Guard troops and active-duty soldiers. While armed looters roamed unchecked last week, the city is now calm. The city's slow recovery is continuing on other fronts as well, local officials said at a late morning news conference. Pumping stations are now operating across much of the city, and many taps and fire hydrants have water pressure. Tests have shown no evidence of cholera or other dangerous diseases in flooded areas. With pumps running and the weather here remaining hot and dry, water has visibly receded across much of the city. Formerly flooded streets are now passable, although covered with leaves, tree branches and mud. Still, many neighborhoods in the northern half of New Orleans remain under 10 feet of water, and Mr. Compass said Thursday that the city's plans for a forced evacuation remained in effect because of the danger of disease and fires. Mr. Compass said he could not disclose when residents might be forced to leave en masse. The city's police department and federal law enforcement officers from agencies like United States Marshals Service will lead the evacuation, he said. Officers will search houses in both dry and flooded neighborhoods, and no one will be allowed to stay, he said. Many of the residents still in the city said they did not understand why the city remained intent on forcing them out. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"As New Orleans descended into chaos last week and Louisiana's governor asked for 40,000 soldiers, President Bush's senior advisers debated whether the president should speed the arrival of active-duty troops by seizing control of the hurricane relief mission from the governor. For reasons of practicality and politics, officials at the Justice Department and the Pentagon, and then at the White House, decided not to urge Mr. Bush to take command of the effort. Instead, the Washington officials decided to rely on the growing number of National Guard personnel flowing into Louisiana, who were under Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco's control. The debate began after officials realized that Hurricane Katrina had exposed a critical flaw in the national disaster response plans created after the Sept. 11 attacks. According to the administration's senior domestic security officials, the plan failed to recognize that local police, fire and medical personnel might be incapacitated. As criticism of the response to Hurricane Katrina has mounted, one of the most pointed questions has been why more troops were not available more quickly to restore order and offer aid. Interviews with officials in Washington and Louisiana show that as the situation grew worse, they were wrangling with questions of federal/state authority, weighing the realities of military logistics and perhaps talking past each other in the crisis. To seize control of the mission, Mr. Bush would have had to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows the president in times of unrest to command active-duty forces into the states to perform law enforcement duties. But decision makers in Washington felt certain that Ms. Blanco would have resisted surrendering control, as Bush administration officials believe would have been required to deploy active-duty combat forces before law and order had been re-established. While combat troops can conduct relief missions without the legal authority of the Insurrection Act, Pentagon and military officials say that no active-duty forces could have been sent into the chaos of New Orleans on Wednesday or Thursday without confronting law-and-order challenges. But just as important to the administration were worries about the message that would have been sent by a president ousting a Southern governor of another party from command of her National Guard, according to administration, Pentagon and Justice Department officials. ''Can you imagine how it would have been perceived if a president of the United States of one party had pre-emptively taken from the female governor of another party the command and control of her forces, unless the security situation made it completely clear that she was unable to effectively execute her command authority and that lawlessness was the inevitable result?'' asked one senior administration official, who spoke anonymously because the talks were confidential. Officials in Louisiana agree that the governor would not have given up control over National Guard troops in her state as would have been required to send large numbers of active-duty soldiers into the area. But they also say they were desperate and would have welcomed assistance by active-duty soldiers. ''I need everything you have got,'' Ms. Blanco said she told Mr. Bush last Monday, after the storm hit. In an interview, she acknowledged that she did not specify what sorts of soldiers. ''Nobody told me that I had to request that,'' Ms. Blanco said. ''I thought that I had requested everything they had. We were living in a war zone by then.'' By Wednesday, she had asked for 40,000 soldiers. In the discussions in Washington, also at issue was whether active-duty troops could respond faster and in larger numbers than the Guard. By last Wednesday, Pentagon officials said even the 82nd Airborne, which has a brigade on standby to move out within 18 hours, could not arrive any faster than 7,000 National Guard troops, which are specially trained and equipped for civilian law enforcement duties. In the end, the flow of thousands of National Guard soldiers, especially military police, was accelerated from other states. ''I was there. I saw what needed to be done,'' Lt. Gen. H Steven Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in an interview. ''They were the fastest, best-capable, most appropriate force to get there in the time allowed. And that's what it's all about.'' But one senior Army officer expressed puzzlement that active-duty troops were not summoned sooner, saying 82nd Airborne troops were ready to move out from Fort Bragg, N.C., on Sunday, the day before the hurricane hit. The call never came, administration officials said, in part because military officials believed Guard troops would get to the stricken region faster and because administration civilians worried that there could be political fallout if federal troops were forced to shoot looters. Louisiana officials were furious that there was not more of a show of force, in terms of relief supplies and troops, from the federal government in the middle of last week. As the water was rising in New Orleans, the governor repeatedly questioned whether Washington had started its promised surge of federal resources. ''We needed equipment,'' Ms. Blanco said in an interview. ''Helicopters. We got isolated.'' Aides to Ms. Blanco said she was prepared to accept the deployment of active-duty military officials in her state. But she and other state officials balked at giving up control of the Guard as Justice Department officials said would have been required by the Insurrection Act if those combat troops were to be sent in before order was restored. In a separate discussion last weekend, the governor also rejected a more modest proposal for a hybrid command structure in which both the Guard and active-duty troops would be under the command of an active-duty, three-star general -- but only after he had been sworn into the Louisiana National Guard. Lt. Gen. James T. Conway, director of operations for the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the Pentagon in August streamlined a rigid, decades-old system of deployment orders to allow the military's Northern Command to dispatch liaisons to work with local officials before an approaching hurricane. The Pentagon is reviewing events from the time Hurricane Katrina reached full strength and bore down on New Orleans and five days later when Mr. Bush ordered 7,200 active-duty soldiers and marines to the scene. After the hurricane passed New Orleans and the levees broke, flooding the city, it became increasingly evident that disaster-response efforts were badly bogged down. Justice Department lawyers, who were receiving harrowing reports from the area, considered whether active-duty military units could be brought into relief operations even if state authorities gave their consent -- or even if they refused. The issue of federalizing the response was one of several legal issues considered in a flurry of meetings at the Justice Department, the White House and other agencies, administration officials said. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales urged Justice Department lawyers to interpret the federal law creatively to help local authorities, those officials said. For example, federal prosecutors prepared to expand their enforcement of some criminal statutes like anti-carjacking laws that can be prosecuted by either state or federal authorities. On the issue of whether the military could be deployed without the invitation of state officials, the Office of Legal Counsel, the unit within the Justice Department that provides legal advice to federal agencies, concluded that the federal government had authority to move in even over the objection of local officials. This act was last invoked in 1992 for the Los Angeles riots, but at the request of Gov. Pete Wilson of California, and has not been invoked over a governor's objections since the civil rights era -- and before that, to the time of the Civil War, administration officials said. Bush administration, Pentagon and senior military officials warned that such an extreme measure would have serious legal and political implications. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has said deployment of National Guard soldiers to Iraq, including a brigade from Louisiana, did not affect the relief mission, but Ms. Blanco disagreed. ''Over the last year, we have had about 5,000 out, at one time,'' she said. ''They are on active duty, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. That certainly is a factor.'' By Friday, National Guard reinforcements had arrived, and a truck convoy of 1,000 Guard soldiers brought relief supplies -- and order -- to the convention center area. Officials from the Department of Homeland Security say the experience with Hurricane Katrina has demonstrated flaws in the nation's plans to handle disaster. ''This event has exposed, perhaps ultimately to our benefit, a deficiency in terms of replacing first responders who tragically may be the first casualties,'' Paul McHale, the assistant secretary of defense for domestic security, said. Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, has suggested that active-duty troops be trained and equipped to intervene if front-line emergency personnel are stricken. But the Pentagon's leadership remains unconvinced that this plan is sound, suggesting instead that the national emergency response plans be revised to draw reinforcements initially from civilian police, firefighters, medical personnel and hazardous-waste experts in other states not affected by a disaster. The federal government rewrote its national emergency response plan after the Sept. 11 attacks, but it relied on local officials to manage any crisis in its opening days. But Hurricane Katrina overwhelmed local ''first responders,'' including civilian police and the National Guard. At a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Chertoff said, ''The unusual set of challenges of conducting a massive evacuation in the context of a still dangerous flood requires us to basically break the traditional model and create a new model, one for what you might call kind of an ultra-catastrophe.'''' STORM AND CRISIS: MILITARY RESPONSE"
"The president of St. Tammany Parish was calling in Thursday to say that conditions out there were gradually improving, while Sam from St. Bernard held one line, Adrian from Metairie held another, and Sheila, just Sheila, ached to get on the air with an urgent request. Her purpose for calling the United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans, a round-the-clock radio program born of the hurricane, flickered on a monitor in the control room: ''Looking for dad in NO East. He refused to evac. Dead? Alive?'' With many of their worst fears now fact, the people in and around New Orleans have needed to communicate with one another: to seek or offer help, to criticize this agency or praise that one, to vent, cry, reassure or just find comfort in the soothing radio voice of someone who has shared their loss. Some people might find escape through a country-music station, or affirmation from a local Christian station that suggests that the Sodom known as New Orleans got what it deserved. (''A city cannot be washed clean. '') But most people here are listening to this program, which is broadcast over several stations to cast a radio-wave net that holds New Orleans together. ''We're still getting calls from people who are trapped,'' said Dave Cohen, the news director. And their cries for help are passed on to the police -- and the New Orleans nation. He is normally the news director for a station owned by the Entercom broadcasting behemoth: WWL-AM, 870 on the dial for news, talk and sports. But nothing has been normal for him or any of his colleagues, not since he received harried word on the afternoon of Friday, Aug. 26 -- two weeks ago, and a lifetime ago. That hurricane everyone thought would bypass us? Correction: New Orleans is now dead center. By that Saturday morning, WWL had established a hurricane headquarters in its downtown studios, across from the Superdome, and was alerting a city that still largely believed the storm would pass it by. By that Sunday, Mr. Cohen and three colleagues had opened a satellite operation in Jefferson Parish, outside the so-called bowl, in case the downtown studio and antenna did not survive. The station broadcast through Sunday night and into Monday morning, its reporters describing what they saw, and when words failed, allowing nature's wrath to howl through their microphones. At one point, the storm blew out the downtown studio's large windows, sending a talk-show host, Garland Robinette, and others scurrying to a back room, where his reports continued. Calmer skies arrived that Tuesday morning to induce premature sighs of relief, but flooding was occurring in the city and word quickly spread that the 17th Street Canal Levee had a breach. Mr. Cohen, still in Jefferson Parish, went on the air to sound a warning -- ''The lake will now start emptying into the city'' -- then ordered his staff in New Orleans to evacuate. He went back on the air, knowing that with power down, most people could receive information only by radio. ''We're it; we're the only lifeline to the people,'' he said. ''I was personally pleading with my listeners to get out of the city.'' One frantic woman called in to say that she was standing in water chest-deep, with a 5-year-old and a 2-month-old. Another caller, a blind man, said he did not know where to turn. ''I don't know what happened to her,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''I don't know what happened to him.'' Back at the downtown studio, many employees managed to flee by car or, eventually, by helicopter. Others, including the morning news anchor, David Blake, and his family, got stuck for several days, so he reported what he saw from the broken-window studio -- namely, the infamous chaos at the Superdome, where crushes of people waited and withered. His early reports had to be redone before they could be broadcast, he recalled. ''My news director said I sounded angry and frustrated,'' he said. ''He felt I had become too emotional.'' Faced with inaccessible downtown studios and a shared mission, Entercom and its sworn enemy, Clear Channel Communications, began working together in a venture they called the United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans. Using Mr. Cohen of Entercom as news director, Clear Channel's studios here in Baton Rouge, and hosts and reporters from both stations, they now broadcast a program that is part news, part counseling. When local public officials want to lash out at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, they call here. When pastors want to spread word of volunteer efforts, they call here. When people want to report the water levels outside their doors, express concerns about abandoned animals, express pride in a city's determination to rebuild, cry out for help or give thanks for living, they call here. Although the distress calls blend into one full-throated cry of SOS, some linger in the mind. Mr. Blake, for example, still hears one man calling to say, ''I've been up in this attic for days; I can't take it anymore.'' On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Cohen's cellphone kept ringing to the tune of ''When the Saints Go Marchin' In,'' with calls from reporters out there somewhere, bearing witness. ''You got a full tank of gas and lots of water,'' he told one. ''If you fall below a half-tank, get the hell back.'' Meanwhile, in the control room, Kat Kageleiry tried to stay on top of all the phone calls lighting up the switchboard. Sam from St. Bernard. Adrian from Metairie. Poor distraught Sheila. ''I'm going to put you on hold and come to you in a few minutes,'' she told one caller. ''Don't hang up.'' STORM AND CRISIS: COMMUNICATION"
"At 4:45 on Thursday morning, P. Edwin Compass III, superintendent of the New Orleans police, awakened a slumbering reporter at City Hall and cajoled him into an early morning trip around this devastated, increasingly deserted city. ''I've been working 21 hours a day; I have a bad back, two sprained knees, two sprained ankles, 55 stitches in my hand that haven't healed from having a cyst removed, hemorrhoids and glaucoma,'' Mr. Compass said. ''I don't want to hear any excuses.'' Wearing a back brace, he walked to a military truck and grunted up the ladder with the assistance of two National Guardsmen. But a tender lumbar region -- strained in a fall from a truck several days ago -- did not suppress his enthusiasm. ''Just remember,'' Mr. Compass, 47, said to his security detail. ''You're with the chief. Nobody gets hurt.'' Since Hurricane Katrina flooded the city, Mr. Compass has been widely criticized for his inability to keep the peace as New Orleans sank into mayhem, and to sustain the morale of his officers, about 500 of whom abandoned the 1,700-member force in anger or despair. In recent days, Mr. Compass, who has been superintendent since 2002, has returned the verbal fire with a raw, impassioned defense of his department. He pointed to those officers who stayed and helped restore order despite a shortage of manpower and ammunition, and volleys of gunshot from what he said were dozens of people trying to thwart rescue efforts. ''This is the time for men of honor, not those others,'' Mr. Compass said, referring to the officers who left. While other cities may prefer a more buttoned-down, businesslike presence from their police chiefs, Mr. Compass exudes the casual, loquacious style of the Big Easy. He wants to be called Eddie, not Edwin, and he is as likely to bump fists when greeting people as to shake hands. On Wednesday, he vigorously wrestled to the ground a friend whom he thought had died in Hurricane Katrina's aftermath, and chided him for ignoring instructions to evacuate. Responding to those who criticize his handling of the chaos, Mr. Compass said he believed that his officers did the best they could, considering that their communications system was inoperable and that the city's ammunition depot was left inaccessible beneath 10 feet of water. ''We faced the greatest challenge that any city has faced in the history of mankind,'' said Mr. Compass, a man who seems to regard understatement as a felony. Some police officers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, complained Wednesday that the superintendent was largely invisible immediately after the flooding began. But others said he had maintained a strong public presence, and they praised him for supporting his officers in a department whose reputation suffered severe damage from corruption scandals in the 1990's. ''That's a cop,'' Sgt. George Jackson said. ''He stands up for his men.'' The son of a postal worker and a homemaker, Mr. Compass grew up in midtown New Orleans, attended grammar school with Mayor C. Ray Nagin and high school with Charles Parent, the city's fire superintendent. Mr. Compass said that he always wanted to be a police officer, and that in the current crisis he was relying on faith for guidance and stamina. ''We couldn't have a better policeman to deal with the pressure he's had to deal with,'' the Rev. Charles J. Southall III, pastor of the First Emanuel Baptist Church of New Orleans, said in a telephone interview. ''But I'm concerned about his health and emotional stability. There's only so much you can give without someone giving back.'' Mr. Compass said that many evacuees were so angry with him as they waited days to be rescued from the convention center that a group of them tried to grab him and take him hostage, saying, ''If we get the chief, we get the buses.'' While he acknowledged that murders and rapes had occurred at both the convention center and the Superdome, Mr. Compass said the mayhem at the unlighted convention center would have been worse if the police had not created a plan to capture the armed thugs who were terrorizing others. Because his officers could not risk harming innocent evacuees by returning fire in the dark, he said, they watched instead for muzzle fire and moved toward it, patting people down and yelling ''gun'' when they felt a weapon. Then officers converged and tackled the gunman. ''That's never been done before,'' Mr. Compass said. ''If we hadn't extracted the weapons, many more may have died.'' He defended Mayor Nagin's decision this week to issue a mandatory evacuation order. If force is required, Mr. Compass said, it will be only the minimum necessary. ''We are the greatest crowd-control police in the world,'' he said. ''We deal with Mardi Gras every year.'' People must leave to allow the city to be rebuilt, and to protect themselves from disease and fires, Mr. Compass said. ''When your child needs a shot, you know it's going to be painful,'' he said. ''But if you don't get the shot, they can die.'' His wife, Arlene, and children have left New Orleans, and so have 600 of the city's remaining 1,200 officers, for a few days of rest and relaxation in Las Vegas and Atlanta. Another shift will leave when the first returns. Mayor Nagin has also sought a little time off, but Mr. Compass said that he was going nowhere for the moment. ''My feet were the first ones on the battlefield,'' he said, ''and they will be the last to leave the battlefield.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE POLICE CHIEF Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"After a day of confusion and complaints, officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Thursday that the agency would not expand a trial program to distribute debit cards worth $2,000 to victims of Hurricane Katrina for immediate living expenses. A FEMA official in Washington said the cards would be distributed at the Astrodome in Houston beginning on Friday. Reports that the debit cards would be distributed on Thursday morning at the Astrodome, a temporary shelter, brought several hours of mayhem to the complex, attracting a crush of cars and pedestrians that caused the police to shut the gates, locking out thousands of residents in the 90-degree heat. Meanwhile, in Baton Rouge,David G. Passey, a FEMA spokesman, said he did not know why the program had been discontinued. But Mr. Passey said, ''As we've looked at the logistics of expanding the debit card, we believe that our normal methods of delivery, checks and electronic funds transfer, will suffice.'' Under questioning by reporters, he said he could not explain why traditional conduits of aid, which take from 10 days to two weeks to reach victims, provided they have addresses or working bank accounts, had been deemed more appropriate than the immediate relief offered by the debit cards. He said ''program specialists'' had made the decision. Announcing the debit card program on Wednesday, Michael D. Brown, the FEMA director, said it was designed to ''empower'' evacuees ''to make their own decisions about what they need to have to restart their lives.'' But he did not say when and where the cards would be distributed. In Baton Rouge, The Associated Press reported, people went to a Red Cross office believing they could get the debit cards there. Callers to a Baton Rouge radio station from as far away as Atlanta and Houston complained that they did not know how to get the cards. One person said she had called the FEMA office in New York, only to be told that the cards were in Atlanta. But Mr. Passey said the cards had been intended for distribution only at the Astrodome, where the highest concentration of evacuees was housed. After the police lockdown at the complex, the order that had characterized the temporary housing situation there so far threatened to collapse, as people fainted, pushed and shoved, and complained loudly. ''It's just a hassle to get assistance,'' said Sparkle Stanwood, 25, an evacuee from downtown New Orleans, as she stood outside an Astrodome gate, sweat glistening on her face. ''They gave us an appointment for 10 a.m. today -- now they won't let us in. Some people broke a gate open. It's a lot of people, and it's hot.'' Another evacuee, Eric Robertson, said: ''We're very angry. We don't really know what's going on. It's so unorganized out here. There's nobody to even answer a question about why the place is on lockdown.'' The Red Cross in Houston began handing out debit cards Thursday loaded with $650 to $1,600 in purchasing power. The relief organization issued 7,000 cards at the Reliant complex around the Astrodome and will issue more Friday at the George R. Brown Convention Center. Tennessee has distributed 1,550 ''electronic benefit cards.'' STORM AND CRISIS: GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE"
"With his wife of 20 years, Denise Jill, in a wheelchair, breathing oxygen from a bottle and sedated for pain from lung cancer and heart disease, Mr. Eaton has been pushing her each morning out of the Astrodome shelter complex to Houston's light-rail line. There he loads her and the wheelchair aboard for the short but agonizing ride to a clinic where she receives a dose of methadone for her pain. Then they repeat the trip in reverse. When they returned to their shelter on Thursday morning, they found the outside gates locked. A premature news report that federal officials were all set to hand out $2,000 debit cards had jammed the roadways with hopeful storm victims. The police responded to the gridlock by locking down the shelters, trapping thousands of people outside, including the Eatons. ''I'm screaming and yelling for someone with a badge,'' Mr. Eaton, 44, a plumber and contractor, said after he was finally let back in. ''The oxygen tank is almost out, and this woman spent 45 minutes in the hot sun.'' Mr. Eaton had been trying for days to get his family into a hotel room or apartment subsidized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That, he said, would allow his wife to obtain a steady supply of medication; two of his teenage daughters could return to school -- a third escaped New Orleans before the storm -- and he could look for work. On Thursday afternoon, his luck turned. City officials moved the family to a room at the Hilton, with the promise of a free apartment starting on Friday. Volunteers said they would drive Mrs. Eaton to her clinic each day. It was their first real relief since the storm. Marooned on the bar's deck, they had felt lucky that they salvaged three filled oxygen tanks, but Mrs. Eaton went without her 15 medications for six days. Scouting dry ground nearby, Mr. Eaton said, he met a group of Hondurans who had a box truck but no gas. He siphoned diesel fuel from some trailer trucks, swallowing some in the process but drawing out 20 gallons. ''It was do or die,'' he said. ''Otherwise this woman would be dead now, and these girls.'' As he recalled the ordeal, he dragged absently on a cigarette, until reminded that he was hazardously close to his wife's oxygen bottle. ''Stress,'' he mumbled, tossing the butt away. ''I'm a human being.'' RALPH BLUMENTHAL STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"

"In November, the First Battalion, Eighth Marines, fought the most pitched battle of the Iraq war, attacking insurgents dug into mosques and narrow streets until the city of Falluja was virtually leveled. Today, many of the same marines are helping this hurricane-battered city inch toward recovery, shoveling stinking mud from a church and roaming the streets in a borrowed pickup delivering food, water and ice to needy families. ''These are the guys who fought the battle of Falluja,'' said Maj. Lew Vogler, the battalion's executive officer. ''Now we're taking care of Slidell, La., with the same professionalism. We've got the muscle and the manpower to get it done.'' At the First Baptist Church, First Lt. Paul Steketee and Cpl. Edwin Maldonado were getting makeshift waders made from black plastic garbage bags wrapped around their legs with duct tape by Lance Cpl. Nicholas Aikman as they prepared to clean out the church's putrid kitchen. Some 500 pounds of meat, milk and cheese rotted when the power went out. ''Oh, it's ugly back there,'' said Bruce Efferson, 56, a minister at the 1,300-member church. Other marines were shoveling mud from the floors, stripping ruined wallpaper and lugging textbooks to the higher shelves of the church's school, which serves 400 students. ''These boys have humped,'' Mr. Efferson said of the marine work crew. ''And I'm ex-Navy; I'm used to making fun of marines.'' Outside the church, the aid from volunteers swelled. A dozen volunteers in yellow T-shirts from the Noonday Baptist Church in Marietta, Ga., presided over relief supplies stretched along the driveway: generators, chain saws, wheelbarrows, bottled water, canned food, rice, Kool-Aid, clothes, soap and shampoo. Mr. Efferson, who said he ran bars and nightclubs before becoming a Christian, observed the scene and said, ''God's still alive.'' Some of the marines roamed the area in Mr. Efferson's white Dodge pickup with a city map and a bullhorn. Riding in the bed of the truck with the supplies of food, water and ice were three lance corporals who are usually scout-snipers, one of the deadliest specialties in the Marines. As they drove past houses that had been reduced to heaps of wood and that had been crushed by boats from a canal, they found a family of six who were grateful for the meals-ready-to-eat that the marines were delivering. ''I'm glad you like them,'' Lieutenant Steketee said dryly. STORM AND CRISIS: THE MARINES"
"Judge Edith Brown Clement, one of the candidates President Bush is considering for the Supreme Court, was among the thousands of people forced from their homes by Hurricane Katrina. Judge Clement left New Orleans in the early stages of the storm, and she and her husband are living now in the Jackson, Miss., home of Judge E. Grady Jolly, a colleague on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, said the circuit's chief judge, Carolyn Dineen King. The court is based in New Orleans. Judge King said the John Minor Wisdom U.S. Court of Appeals Building on Camp Street in New Orleans had not suffered much damage. But Judge Clement and two other appeals court judges who worked there have moved to other cities in the circuit and expect to work outside New Orleans for an indefinite time. Judge Jolly, reached at his chambers in Jackson, said that Judge Clement and her husband, Rutledge C. Clement Jr., were staying at his home at his invitation, and that Judge Clement was resting and not taking calls. He said she was considering workspace in the James O. Eastland Federal Building in Jackson, where he works. But that building suffered some hurricane damage as well, Judge Jolly said. The Clements' home in New Orleans was damaged but not destroyed, he said. The Evacuees"
"For this disaster President Bush needed his second in command to be a visible presence, not a force operating from a secure undisclosed location. So Vice President Dick Cheney on Thursday joined the blitz of administration officials tromping through the havoc the hurricane left, declaring, ''We're making significant progress.'' He walked a once-well-to-do block of Gulfport, Miss., where homes had been pulverized into piles of planks. He stood on a foul-smelling bridge here overlooking the sandbag-filled breach in the 17th Street Canal levee. And he defended the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal officials who have come under fire, while promising that the government could wage war in Iraq and recover from the hurricane without a tax increase. ''If there's a place on the face of the earth that has the resources to deal with these problems it's the United States of America, and we're going to get it done,'' Mr. Cheney said here in one of two rare question-and-answer sessions with reporters. ''There's no question there were problems with respect to the evacuation in New Orleans. We've gotten around that problem now, and I think everyone's focused on the future.'' In creased khakis and a crisp blue button-down shirt, his laminated schedule and a silver pen in his breast pocket, Mr. Cheney struck a sharply different pose than he did during the last national catastrophe, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when his leadership was considered so crucial that he was kept separate from President Bush and largely out of sight for weeks at a time. He said he would return to the region on Saturday, most likely to the eye of the disaster-diaspora in Texas. Mr. Bush has visited the Gulf Coast twice in the past week, the secretaries of state and defense have made tours, and an array of cabinet officers is expected Friday. Mr. Cheney expressed little emotion at what he had witnessed, instead taking the pragmatic problem-solver tack. Among the long-term issues he said he was concerned about were whether people without flood insurance would be covered under their homeowners' policies since the waters stemmed from a hurricane, how displaced people would receive their Social Security, unemployment and other government benefits, and long-term housing for evacuees. In Gulfport, a block off the ocean on Second Street, in a neighborhood so devastated that residents needed permits to visit their destroyed properties and had to be out by dark, a heckler in an orange shirt hurled profanities twice to disrupt Mr. Cheney's remarks, but the vice president just smiled his lopsided smile and, when asked, said it was the first time he had heard such guff. He got a better reception at the home of Becky Dubuisson, 51, an administrator at NASA, where a picket fence was washed up in the yard and the storm surge had come up to the first floor. ''You're out here sweating and sweating, putting on bug spray, and the vice president shows up -- it lifts your spirits,'' said Dan Younghouse, Ms. Dubuisson's brother-in-law, who had come from Albertville, Ala., to help her clean. ''With the magnitude of it all, where do you start? As far as I'm concerned, this is as good as could be expected.'' In New Orleans, at the 17th Street Canal on the soaked border with suburban Metairie, Mr. Cheney leaned over to touch the 7,000-pound sandbags that Chinook helicopters had deposited into the levee breaches that let the floodwaters flow. Then he shook hands with about a hundred Coast Guard members who had spent more than a week rescuing stranded residents, and looked over the levee, where homes remained under water up to their second-story windows, and little more than the steeple was showing of the Pontchartrain Baptist Church. A huge pipe pumped sludge-filled water the color of Army fatigues from the street back into the lake, a fire burned at one submerged house, and the toxic blend filled the air with a sulfurlike stench. ''You've got to recognize the severity of what Mother Nature did to us here,'' Mr. Cheney said when asked what had gone wrong in the hurricane's aftermath. He endorsed the notion of a Congressional committee's examining the response, but fretted at the politicization of the issue, saying the hurricane survivors he had met were not playing the blame game consuming much of Washington and Baton Rouge. ''Not one of them asks us those questions,'' he said. ''They're not looking backwards. They're not worried about whether someone is a Republican or a Democrat. They're focused on the task at hand.'' Asked in Mississippi whether FEMA should be headed by political appointees like its current director, Michael D. Brown, rather than career disaster professionals, Mr. Cheney said, ''You got to have people at the top who respond to and are selected by presidents.'' Mr. Cheney was traveling with his wife, Lynne; Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales -- who made a side trip to the makeshift jail at a Greyhound station -- and Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security. He was also joined here by Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, a Democrat, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana. Governor Blanco, who had been critical of the administration's initial handling of the hurricane's aftermath, said after the visit, ''I think the federal response is going to be more than adequate from here on out. ''We need them for the long haul by our side,'' she said as Mr. Cheney left for Baton Rouge, where he was debriefed at the state Emergency Operations Center. ''I can walk with confidence that the federal government will stay by our side for many, many months to come.'' Indeed, Mr. Cheney said he expected the rebuilding of New Orleans to ''last a good long time,'' vowing to ''bring it back better than ever, but that will take several years.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE VICE PRESIDENT"
"Education Secretary Margaret Spellings telephoned the Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama state school superintendents and other top Gulf Coast educators yesterday, offering broad federal assistance to stricken schools and universities. The federal government will ignore deadlines facing school systems in gulf states on some federal financing programs, Ms. Spellings told the educators, and the government will cut through red tape and be flexible on other educational questions, she said in an interview. ''I told them we wanted to help them in any way we could,'' she said. Ms. Spellings said the superintendent in Mississippi, Hank M. Bounds, had asked for help in finding temporary classrooms, because 271 schools have been damaged or destroyed. The school superintendent in Houston, Abelardo Saavedra, reported that his schools could accommodate 30,000 displaced students. Dr. Saavedra asked Ms. Spellings to waive federal requirements that homeless students be educated at the school nearest their temporary shelter, because thousands are expected to be housed at the Astrodome and could overrun nearby schools, Ms. Spellings said. The waiver would let students in the Astrodome be bused to schools across Houston, she said. In a sign that the secretary hopes, at least during the relief effort, to get past the rancor between some educators and the Bush administration, Ms. Spellings said she had invited 40 educational groups to participate in a panel that would coordinate efforts. The invitation went not only to groups like the PTA and the superintendents' associations, but also to the national teachers' unions, which have sharply criticized administration policies. Ms. Spellings's predecessor, Rod Paige, once called the largest union, the National Education Association, a ''terrorist organization.'' ''This is not about politics,'' Ms. Spellings said. ''This is all hands on deck.'' The executive director of the N.E.A., John Wilson, said his union had been invited to send a representative to a meeting next Wednesday. ''We'll have somebody there, because we think it's important for all the education groups to unite and help the children on the Gulf Coast,'' Mr. Wilson said. The federal government will be extremely flexible with the devastated systems but less so with districts elsewhere that might enroll displaced students, Ms. Spellings said, adding, ''This will become a national issue, because these kids are going to end up in schools all over.'' The mere presence of displaced students in some districts would not persuade her to suspend the accountability requirements of President Bush's No Child Left Behind education law for those students, she said. ''If 10 kids end up in the Little Rock system,'' Ms. Spellings said, ''I won't necessarily exempt them from the accountability provision.'' STORM AND CRISIS: EDUCATION"
"On Thursday night, Michael D. Brown, the federal government's point man for managing the response to Hurricane Katrina, made a remarkable confession on live television. Speaking of the thousands stranded at the convention center in New Orleans without food or water, Mr. Brown said that his agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, had just learned of their plight. CNN's Paula Zahn was incredulous. ''Sir,'' she said, ''you aren't just telling me you just learned that the folks at the convention center didn't have food and water until today, are you? You had no idea they were completely cut off?'' ''Paula,'' Mr. Brown replied unequivocally, ''the federal government did not even know about the convention center people until today.'' The comment symbolized what some have described as a deeply flawed federal response. President Bush praised Mr. Brown's performance on Friday, but Mr. Brown's remarks prompted Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, to call on President Bush to fire Mr. Brown or Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. ''That was just a boneheaded statement from someone who should be in charge of this situation,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''The president will have to change the leadership so that a response this bad will never, never happen again for the American people.'' Mr. Brown, 50, is a Republican lawyer who worked for the International Arabian Horse Association before joining FEMA in 2001 as general counsel. This week he has become the public face of an agency that critics say has lost focus and clout since it was absorbed in 2003 by the new Department of Homeland Security. Now that FEMA is part of a much larger bureaucracy created to counter the threat of terrorism, its role in dealing with natural disasters has been diminished, state emergency management directors, disaster experts and former FEMA officials say. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, asked the president to name a new cabinet-level official to direct the effort. Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, said FEMA should be separated from the Department of Homeland Security. ''FEMA should not be hindered by a top-heavy bureaucracy when they are needed to act swiftly to save lives,'' Mr. Foley said. Since FEMA's absorption into Homeland Security, its ties to state emergency programs have been weakened, and it has reduced spending on disaster preparation, critics say. Russ Knocke, press secretary at Homeland Security, denied that FEMA's move to the department had hurt it. ''Not only does FEMA have the resources but it has the backing of the department to do the job,'' he said. Mr. Brown was brought to FEMA in 2001 by the then-director, Joe M. Allbaugh, an old friend who had run Mr. Bush's first presidential campaign. He was promoted to deputy director in 2002 and to director in 2003. The public first saw Mr. Brown's folksy manner when he led the response to the 2004 Florida hurricanes. FEMA was later criticized for giving millions to undeserving residents. This week he has displayed striking candor, saying he awakened Monday thinking the agency had underestimated the storm and later admitting that the lawlessness surprised him. Andy Lester, a friend who practiced law with Mr. Brown, called him ''an incredibly compassionate, very dedicated fellow in a thankless job.'' Mr. Allbaugh said Mr. Brown is ''doing a great job.'' ''I know a lot of people right now want to point fingers and criticize, but people should keep their powder dry,'' he said. ''Disasters, particularly one of this magnitude, are always ugly to begin with.'' FEMA was created by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 after criticism of the government's fragmented response to a series of disasters, including Hurricane Camille in 1969 and California earthquakes in 1971. Hurricane Andrew, which struck South Florida in 1992, demonstrated that the federal government still had not sufficiently figured out how to respond smoothly, as thousands were initially left without shelter or water. The agency had a reputation for political patronage and pork barrel spending. It was with the appointment in 1993 of James Lee Witt, from Arkansas, that the agency began to earn respect. Mr. Clinton made FEMA a cabinet-level agency. ''Witt shaped it into an organization that was not only to respond to disaster but attempt to mitigate disaster by taking actions before they occurred,'' said Michael Greenberger, a domestic security expert at the University of Maryland and a former Justice Department official. After severe flooding in the Midwest in 1993, FEMA under Mr. Witt, for example, bought more than 10,000 properties adjacent to rivers and relocated residents and businesses. In Grafton, Ill., where 403 residents and businesses applied for disaster aid after the 1993 flood, only 11 applied when the river overflowed again in 1995, FEMA said at the time. The approach to disaster management changed with the arrival of President Bush, experts in emergency management say. Mr. Bush appointed Mr. Allbaugh, who was Mr. Bush's chief of staff when he was governor of Texas. Testifying before Congress in 2001, Mr. Allbaugh said he was concerned that federal disaster assistance had become ''an oversized entitlement program'' and made it clear that the new administration wanted to curtail FEMA's mission. His goal, he said, was to ''restore the predominant role of state and local response to most disasters.'' While Mr. Allbaugh was FEMA director, the Bush administration, with the backing of Congress, reversed the emphasis on preventing flooding, cutting the formula for such federal grants by half. ''It just does not make good sense,'' said Larry A. Larson, director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. FEMA's budget in recent years under the Bush administration has grown, from $4.6 billion in 2002 to $5.038 billion as originally enacted this fiscal year. But after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the agency was merged along with 21 other agencies into the newly formed Department of Homeland Security. Grants previously distributed directly to local and state governments were assigned to a separate Homeland Security office. As a result, three out of every four so-called federal preparedness grants now are spent on counterterrorism. Representative Thompson, whose Mississippi district was damaged by Katrina, said that during the Bush administration, FEMA had lost its focus. ''FEMA went back to being treated like a political resting place for favors that were owed,'' he said. ''The entire emphasis of it was demoted.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE EMERGENCY AGENCY"
"From the moment he walked out of the Oval Office toward his helicopter on Friday morning until he left New Orleans at the end of the day, President Bush's task was to erase the hardening impression that his administration had failed to act with sufficient urgency to address the suffering of tens of thousands of people. Mr. Bush has been imperiled politically by the deep gulf between the disturbing reality in the storm-ravaged South and what was widely perceived to be a slow federal response detached from the desperation felt on the ground. He used his trip to try to close the perception gap and made some progress, demonstrating compassion toward those he ran into, particularly in Mississippi, which represents politically solid ground. The impact of his trip was magnified by the fact that it coincided with those of convoys carrying food, water and troops. But the overall impression Mr. Bush gave was tentative, particularly compared with the confident visit he paid to New York four years ago, just three days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Then, he took up a bullhorn to hail rescue workers at ground zero; on Friday, he steered clear of the streets of New Orleans, whose stricken population could not be counted on to hail him with open arms. Mr. Bush began his day by saying on the South Lawn of the White House that the results of the federal effort so far were ''not acceptable.'' But he qualified that criticism as the day wore on, apparently out of discomfort with the implication that he was criticizing rescue and relief workers. At times he seemed off balance, on a trip that took him to Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, and he struck a few discordant notes along the way. In Mobile, Ala., he touched only briefly on how hundreds of thousands of displaced people in the region would be housed in the weeks and months ahead, but singled out Senator Trent Lott's intention to rebuild his home in Pascagoula, Miss. At several stops Mr. Bush appeared as concerned with bucking up the morale of government officials, like Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, as with reassuring people whose health and livelihoods were at risk. Even as he pledged to right what had gone wrong with the rescue and relief effort, he congratulated Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whom he called Brownie, for doing ''a heck of a job,'' an evaluation not widely shared in New Orleans. Fortuitously or by design, Mr. Bush reached the region on the very day that a huge influx of supplies and waves of troops arrived in New Orleans, palpably easing the crisis. And he generated scenes that will no doubt help repair his image, as he hugged victims of the hurricane in Biloxi, Miss., and stood near the site of the main levee breach in New Orleans. The White House's political recovery effort extended beyond Mr. Bush. With race looming as an issue, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the most prominent African-American member of the administration, said Friday that she would travel on Sunday to her native Alabama to see the storm damage and recovery efforts. Mr. Bush often rebounds after faltering. He performed poorly last fall in his first debate against Senator John Kerry, his Democratic opponent in the presidential race, but then did much better in the next two. It took him a few days to regain his footing and find his voice after the terrorist attacks of nearly four years ago. The iconic image of his response to 9/11 came on Sept. 14, 2001, when he stood at ground zero with that bullhorn in his hands; his uncertain performance the day of the attacks is far less remembered. ''It's natural to want to blame somebody,'' said Ron Kaufman, a veteran Republican strategist and lobbyist. ''But I don't think that in the end, as long as he carries through with the kind of tone he set today, that he'll pay any kind of price.'' Democrats made clear that however much progress the administration shows in the days ahead in dealing with the disaster, they intended to make Mr. Bush's management of the response an issue for a long time to come. ''The lack of an adequate, swift response to this emergency should not be covered up with political grandstanding and slaps on the back,'' said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York. ''This failure must not be swept under the rug.'' Until Friday, Mr. Bush had all but invited the torrent of criticism that he was out of touch with the scale of the human tragedy unfolding in Louisiana, often sounding off-key in the context of what may prove to be the worst natural disaster the nation has suffered. On Thursday afternoon, with New Orleans in a state of near anarchy and tens of thousands of people there pleading for help, he stood before the cameras in the Oval Office to speak of his ''sympathy,'' his desire ''to make sure I fully understand the relief efforts'' and his judgment that ''the federal government has got an important role to play.'' Earlier, in an interview with ABC, he said no one had expected the levees in New Orleans to be breached, when in fact engineers, members of Congress and other government officials had been warning of just such a risk for years. ''Katrina took away his agenda, and maybe his image as a leader, unless he pulls it out in the next few days,'' said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington. ''His initial reaction was certainly not as quick and compassionate as a lot of people would have liked.'' If Mr. Bush is to keep from having the disaster and his response to it weigh him down for much of the rest of his presidency, he will have to use it as a springboard to improve the domestic security system and quickly develop a broad, appealing vision of how to rebuild the Gulf Coast, said former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican. ''As a test of the homeland security system, this was a failure,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''It's important for the president to lead the nation in saying -- and he has already said -- that this is unacceptable. This is not a moment to defend inadequacy. It's a moment to respond very aggressively to human suffering and establish a vision of a more secure, more prosperous Gulf Coast.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ASSESSMENT"
"President Bush, facing searing criticism over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina, toured New Orleans and the Gulf Coast yesterday in his first on-the-ground look at the desperation that has gripped the region for the last five days. ''I want you to know that I'm not going to forget what I've seen,'' Mr. Bush said in remarks at the end of the day on the tarmac at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. ''I understand the devastation requires more than one day's attention. It's going to require the attention from this country for a long period of time.'' Mr. Bush's arrival coincided with long-awaited deliveries of aid to the flood zone. But the president did not interact much with storm victims, and at one site, a Salvation Army truck in Mississippi, those he did see had first been screened by Secret Service agents with metal detectors. Mr. Bush flew back to Washington from New Orleans without paying a visit to the chaotic makeshift trauma center set up in one terminal at the airport, where many patients evacuated from the city's hospitals were dying before they could be airlifted to other cities. For the first time, Mr. Bush acknowledged that the government response to the catastrophe had fallen short. ''The results are not acceptable,'' the president said as he left the White House about 9 a.m., his face grim. Later, however, after a walking tour of Point Cadet, a poor neighborhood of flattened one-story bungalows in Biloxi, Miss., Mr. Bush amended his remark to say, ''I'm certainly not denigrating the efforts of anybody.'' He added, ''I am satisfied with the response, I'm not satisfied with all the results.'' Mr. Bush toured Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana as he was coming under some of the harshest attacks of his presidency -- from Democrats, Republicans, local officials, hurricane victims and the general public, who have been shocked by scenes of bodies floating in floodwater and the elderly left dead in their wheelchairs in the world's most powerful nation. ''I don't think anybody can be prepared for the vastness of the destruction,'' Mr. Bush told reporters in Biloxi, after walking through streets of crushed cars and the occasional concrete stairway to nowhere. ''You can look at a picture, but until you sit on that doorstep of a house that used to be, or stand by the rubble, you just can't imagine it.'' He also declared that the United States had the resources to fight this disaster as well as the war in Iraq. ''Somebody questioned me the other day, 'Do we have enough National Guard troops?''' Mr. Bush said. ''Of course we do.'' In Biloxi, Mr. Bush hugged and kissed two weeping sisters on a street where a house had collapsed, telling them to ''hang in there,'' and later passed out bottles of water to residents at a Salvation Army truck. It was the first time that the president encountered a storm victim since the hurricane slammed into the Gulf Coast on Monday and Lake Pontchartrain flooded 80 percent of New Orleans on Tuesday. Mr. Bush toured the city by helicopter with Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana and C. Ray Nagin, the New Orleans mayor, who on a local radio station on Thursday night urged federal officials to ''get off your asses and do something.'' Mr. Bush did not go into the heart of the city's devastation, where thousands of largely poor, black refugees have raged at the government's response to one of the worst natural disasters in American history. The White House cited security concerns and worries about causing more chaos as the reasons for keeping Mr. Bush away from the streets and the New Orleans Superdome, where refugees have lived in squalor and lawlessness for days. ''The president wanted to see as much as he could without impeding the relief efforts,'' said Erin Healy, a White House spokeswoman. Throughout his day, Mr. Bush did not address the shocking images of the desperate and dying on television, even when he was asked by a reporter in Biloxi ''why the richest nation on earth can't get food and water to those people that need it.'' Mr. Bush sidestepped the question and responded that helicopters had rescued people from rooftops and ''thousands of peoples' lives have been saved immediately, and that's good news.'' He did stop to see the work going on to repair the breach in the city's levee that caused much of the flooding, and said at the airport that ''there's a lot of people working hard, and they're making good progress.'' The president's goal for the day seemed to be one of spreading hope and encouragement, which he offered publicly in New Orleans to Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who has been sharply criticized for its response to the disaster. White House officials had said that Mr. Bush, in cutting short his monthlong vacation, would tour the region either Friday or Saturday, and in the end he chose the day on which he could arrive simultaneously with the first convoys of relief supplies. As Mr. Bush appeared in Biloxi, cable television channels ran a split-screen image of National Guard trucks bringing food and water to desperate people in the Superdome. In Biloxi, many residents of the Point Cadet neighborhood said they had been buoyed by the president's visit. ''He's going to give us all the help he can. I think he's seen enough devastation,'' said Valerie Owens, who had received a hug and a kiss from Mr. Bush when she went to get food from the Salvation Army truck. The president teared up, Ms. Owens said, as she told him how she and her family and neighbors, including two children, ages 2 and 5, had ridden out the storm for five hours on a small flat boat, named the S.S. Minnow, just like on ''Gilligan's Island.'' ''The only one not crying,'' she said, ''was the 5-year-old girl.'' Ellen Robertson, 51, met the president with her 7-year-old niece. ''He said he's trying to get everything back on track for us,'' Ms. Robertson said. She and her family live in four houses along a nearby street and all had their roofs crushed by trees, debris and wind. ''I believe him because I have to,'' she said. ''I have no choice for right now.'' But on the edge of the neighborhood, people sat in their yards grumbling about relief efforts and declining to go meet the president. ''It's been three days; there's still no ice this side of town,'' said Mack McCormack, who was living with three other men in a small home where mud stains six feet up the side were evidence of Hurricane Katrina's visit. ''There are people who are hurt. They can't get out to get ice. We're making two trips today with these coolers with wheels to get it for them.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT"
"He has been camped out for days on the 27th floor of a structurally damaged and powerless hotel in New Orleans, sending runners to communicate with the few staff members who remain in an increasingly futile effort to run some semblance of a municipal government. Like many others in New Orleans, Mayor C. Ray Nagin is a man with a home under water, a man whose family has fled to higher ground, a man who is worried about food and clean drinking water. But at this moment, what defines Mr. Nagin is that he is a mayor without a city. When he was elected three years ago, he was the great hope of New Orleans, a popular newcomer unfettered by ties to old-line political organizations, an energetic redeemer swept into office on the promise that he would rid the city of corruption. Now New Orleans is in ruins. And Mayor Nagin is steadily losing what little power he has to govern the desperate and dispossessed citizens who remain under his care. On Thursday, four days after Hurricane Katrina struck, the personal toll of this harsh reality became clear. For a moment, Mr. Nagin's customarily calm demeanor dissolved into anger, and he lashed out at the federal government for what he called its slow response in sending the National Guard to help control the growing crisis. ''Don't tell me 40,000 people are coming here,'' he said. ''They're not here. It's too doggone late. Now get off your asses and do something, and let's fix the biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country.'' The interviewer, Garland Robinette of WWL-AM Radio, responded, ''I bet that the people listening to you are on your side.'' Even a week ago, when the mayor's approval rating was over 60 percent, most would have agreed. But among the uncertainties that have followed in the hurricane's wake is what Mr. Nagin's legacy will be. Will he ultimately be viewed as a strong leader in crisis, a Southern version of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who guided New York through the dark days after Sept. 11? Or will he be remembered as a mayor who was not up to the task? In recent days, Mayor Nagin has been under attack inside and outside of the city. His decision to stay at a Hyatt hotel near the Superdome has met with both praise and criticism. To his supporters, it is evidence that he is a captain who refuses to abandon his ship, even as it sinks. To his critics, it is proof of his stubbornness, a refusal to go with the rest of his government to makeshift quarters in the state capital, Baton Rouge, where he might have been in a better position to communicate with others and coordinate the relief effort. Many hurricane victims, living on the streets or huddled in unbearable conditions in the Superdome, had nothing but harsh words for the mayor. They blamed him, along with President Bush and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as failing to respond more quickly to their plight. And they called him a coward for not setting foot inside the putrid hallways of the stadium but instead speaking to people outside. ''We've been in here for five days, and he still hasn't shown his face to us,'' said Donnieka Rhinehart, 26, as she prepared to board a bus outside the domed stadium. ''I support the mayor,'' said Jason Magee, a golf professional from the New Orleans area living temporarily in Baton Rouge, 75 miles to the west-northwest. ''I think a lot of us do. I think this is a federal-level problem. I'm displaced and I'm not happy, but I'm not angry at the mayor.'' Mr. Nagin could not be reached for comment despite repeated efforts through his staff members, who are working out of their cars or in temporary offices in Baton Rouge or Houston. He did meet with President Bush on Friday. Perhaps the strongest complaint against Mr. Nagin, himself an African-American, is that he did not move aggressively enough to evacuate the poorest, most vulnerable, predominantly African-American citizens from their low-lying neighborhoods in New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward. Inside the Superdome, a rumor circulated that Mr. Nagin and other city officials deliberately dynamited levees after the hurricane so floodwater would be diverted from the French Quarter into the impoverished Ninth Ward. ''They saved the tourist area but ruined the Ninth Ward,'' said Ashan Jacobs, 25, a bartender. Louisiana officials have rallied to Mr. Nagin's side, emphasizing that the magnitude of the disaster would have overwhelmed any mayor. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said Mr. Nagin's best efforts were felled by the communication system that collapsed all around him. ''No matter how great a mayor is, and this mayor is great, they cannot function well without good communication,'' Ms. Landrieu said. ''No mayor could have kept control of this city without a functioning communication system. He couldn't call a press conference or the chief of police.'' The city's head of intergovernmental relations, Kenya Smith, is among Mr. Nagin's closest aides. Mr. Smith, speaking from the state police headquarters in Baton Rouge, said he had never seen the mayor on the attack in quite the way he was in the radio interview on Thursday. But he questioned whether the mayor's outburst was strategically planned. ''It was probably designed to put a little fire under those who can get resources to the city,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I don't think it was so much him venting as trying to ensure the delivery of resources. It was not done without thought.'' Rodney Braxton, the city's chief legislative lobbyist, added, ''It's important that people understand how frustrated he is.'' Mr. Braxton added: ''Right now, he's very upset and agitated. I'm seeing a different Ray Nagin.'' In March 2002, when Clarence Ray Nagin was elected with 58 percent of the vote, the city seemed to welcome him as an independent-thinking reformer who was not part of the cronyism that had in the past held so much sway over mayoral races. Disgusted with corruption in local government, voters gave him a chance, despite his lack of political experience. Mr. Nagin had been an executive with Cox Communications, which operates the local cable television system. ''New Orleans is going to do things different,'' Mr. Nagin, a Democrat, told cheering supporters on election night after defeating his closest opponent, Richard Pennington, the former chief of police. A product of the New Orleans public school system, Mr. Nagin seemed like someone waiting to give back. ''I'm not in it for the money; I'm in it for our children and grandchildren,'' he said after his election victory. In his three years in office, Mr. Nagin has begun to act on his campaign promises. He has started building and economic development programs valued at about $4 billion and was a proponent of homeownership in the city's poorest neighborhoods -- the ones that were most affected by the flooding. While working at Cox, Mr. Nagin was credited with turning around the faltering regional operation. As mayor, he said he would use his business acumen to create a larger black middle class by restructuring a local economy that had too many low-wage jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry, and not enough of anything else. Now, low-wage jobs are the least of Mr. Nagin's concerns. When the city finally dries out, many wonder if there will be any tourism industry left. ''There are lots of people who want to be the mayor of New Orleans,'' Mr. Braxton, the lobbyist, said, ''but I bet they don't want to be the mayor right now. I've asked him to come up here to Baton Rouge. But Ray said he is not going to leave New Orleans, period.'' He added: ''It's exactly like this: The ship is full of water, but the captain is not leaving. Not without the crew. The crew are those poor people you see on TV in wheelchairs at the Superdome. That's his crew.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE MAYOR"
"A risk management firm yesterday offered the first estimate of economic losses from Hurricane Katrina -- $100 billion -- and said that private insurance would probably cover less than a quarter of that. Federal money and charitable contributions may need to do the rest. Saying the damage already appeared far greater than expected, Risk Management Solutions in Newark, Calif., said that insured losses would range from $20 billion to $35 billion, much higher than the firm's initial estimate of $10 billion to $25 billion. The new figures suggest that Hurricane Katrina will cost the insurance industry more than any other natural disaster on record, unseating Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which cost $21 billion in 2004 dollars, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. Katrina's price tag may also overshadow the $23 billion in insured losses caused by four large hurricanes last year in South Florida. But there is far more that commercial insurers will not absorb. Uninsured losses often include damage to roads, highways, utilities and public buildings, as well as the cost of government relief efforts. There is also the huge cost of not doing business, which the firm estimated at $100 million a day. Not only will the total losses reach $100 billion, but they may keep climbing if efforts to repair the levees in New Orleans stall, said Kyle Beatty, a Risk Management Solutions meteorologist. While the insurance industry's share of that $100 billion will still be high, ''there's far more economic dislocation relative to the insurance dollars coming in,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the Insurance Investment Institute. Mr. Hartwig said that insurance dollars were often the most potent, since they came in the form of cash rather than low-interest loans. ''It means that for New Orleans to get back to where it was the day before Katrina will take longer.'' And he said that policyholders should not expect insurers to try to cover flood damage out of generosity. ''Insurers will pay every dollar that they promised to pay under the terms of their contact, but flood is very clearly excluded from policies, and it always has been,'' he said To be sure, insurance companies could face still more liability, Mr. Beatty said, especially where looting and vandalism are at play. But there will remain a large gap between insured losses and economic losses, suggesting that government and private donations will be hugely important to the region's recovery. How the country will close the gap is unclear. Congress approved a $10.5 billion emergency aid package yesterday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which finances flood insurance for homeowners, is still repaying the Treasury for the $300 million it borrowed after last year's hurricane season. ''If the flood insurance fund runs dry, we can tap the Treasury,'' said Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for FEMA. ''Chances are good we'll have to do that for this storm because of the catastrophic nature of it.'' ''Residents should not be worried that the flood insurance program is insolvent,'' Mr. Kinerney added. ''Be assured, we're not going belly-up, and we're not going away.'' The many homeowners who lack flood insurance -- including 6 of 10 homeowners in New Orleans, according to federal data -- will most likely be applying for aid. And even getting people their money may prove more challenging than in past catastrophes. ''I think what makes this one different is just the sheer scope and size of it,'' said Ray Stone, vice president for catastrophe operations at St. Paul Travelers, which has one of the largest shares of customers in Louisiana. ''It's just going to be a much, much longer haul.'' Risk Management Solutions estimated that the flood in New Orleans had inundated 150,000 properties, making it the most damaging flood in the nation's history. The most recent flood of similar proportions, the firm said, was a 1953 flood in the Netherlands. It, too, was caused by a major storm surge that overwhelmed barriers protecting a city below sea level. That flood submerged 47,000 properties and killed 1,800 people. It took six months to pump the community dry. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE DAMAGES"
"Less than a week after Hurricane Katrina severely disrupted energy supplies, spot gasoline shortages were reported yesterday at service stations in New York City and across the country heading into the three-day Labor Day weekend. If consumers do not heed warnings to refrain from panicked buying, industry officials and analysts said, the situation could worsen. AAA said it had received many sporadic reports of service stations running out of gasoline, but noted that even in cities where dozens of stations were said to be out, hundreds of other outlets still had ample supplies. A day after gas prices in New York and much of the country passed $3 a gallon, there were increasing reports of pumps running dry, though officials in New York City said there was no gasoline emergency. Nonetheless, in Albany, the State Senate called a special session for Sept. 20 to seek solutions to high gas prices. And a committee of the New York City Council vowed to crack down on price gouging. At a Mobil station in Fort Lee, N.J., the manager, Mohammed Idrees, said he had run out of gas every day from Tuesday to Thursday. Mr. Idrees's supplier, who calls to tell him when his daily tanker will arrive, has not called. Mr. Idrees was down to his last 1,500 gallons late yesterday afternoon. ''The supplier doesn't have an answer for us as to when he's going to bring more,'' he said. Last night, several service stations along Route 17 in New Jersey had no gas and turned away motorists. The shortages are particularly worrisome because they come at the beginning of a long weekend when many families take their last road trips before the end of the summer travel season. Industry officials said that while they were trying to ensure that ample supplies would be available through the holiday and beyond, consumers would probably determine if they and their neighbors could get home on Monday without too many headaches. ''The real downside of this hysteria is that people hear rumors about outages in other towns and rush out to gas up, thereby increasing the likelihood of gas lines and outages in their own town,'' said Justin McNaull, a spokesman for AAA in Washington. Broadly speaking, the United States should have plenty of gasoline inventories to meet demand. At the end of last week, the country had about 194 million barrels of gasoline, and on an average day, Americans consume about 9.3 million barrels. ''The key thing that I can't answer is will consumers act appropriately,'' said John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group. ''If they decide to rush the system, it can't handle it even in the best of times.'' The oil industry and government, meanwhile, reported progress yesterday in easing supply shortages and resuming a semblance of normal operations at pipelines, refineries and a critical oil import terminal. The International Energy Agency said its members would release two million barrels of emergency oil and gasoline to the United States a day for the next 30 days. The United States energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, said the federal government would release 30 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as part of the initiative. Gasoline futures prices -- the rough equivalent of wholesale prices -- fell for the first time this week, signaling that traders and analysts believed that the government and industry were addressing supply constraints. Supplies were tightest in the South, especially in the states that took a direct hit from the hurricane. AAA said yesterday afternoon that many stations in the Florida Panhandle cities of Pensacola and Panama City were out of gasoline. The Hancock County School District in Sparta, Ga., about 100 miles east of Atlanta, cancelled classes on Thursday because it could not buy enough gas for its school buses. C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., a logistics company that oversees 11,000 to 12,000 truckloads of freight daily, said some trucking companies were reluctant to send drivers into the area hit by Hurricane Katrina because of the diesel fuel shortage. ''We're happy when anyone will take a load south,'' said Chris O'Brien, vice president for transportation at C.H. Robinson, which is based in Eden Prairie, Minn. ''We can't guarantee there will even be fuel.'' The hurricane knocked out oil production in the gulf, shut down a major import terminal and hampered operations at nine refineries. Power failures severely reduced the capacity of two main pipelines that feed finished gasoline and other fuels to the eastern half of the country. ''From the start of the supply chain to the end of the chain, everything stopped,'' said Benjamin Brockwell, director of pricing for the Oil Price Information Service, which compiles a widely followed survey of gas prices. ''So that means that product that was already in the distribution system was sucked dry.'' Yesterday, the government and industry reported progress in restoring at least pieces of that system. The Colonial Pipeline Company, which typically transports about 2.4 million barrels of fuel daily, said it was operating at 70 percent capacity yesterday evening and would be at 86 percent by late this weekend. Kinder Morgan, the Houston-based operator of the Plantation pipeline, said it was approaching 95 percent of its daily average volume of about 640,000 barrels. Both pipelines struggled to restart after they lost power to fuel pumps in Louisiana and Mississippi. Also, the Energy Department said Entergy, the electric utility, had restored power to all but three refineries in the New Orleans area and refiners were restarting and increasing production. All told, eight refineries in the region remain shut and may stay that way for a few days or weeks while companies deal with flooding and power disruptions. On Thursday evening, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, an import terminal in the gulf where tankers deposit crude oil shipments, accepted its first shipment since Saturday, the company that runs it said. The Coast Guard said four other ships were waiting to deposit oil at the terminal. The Energy Department is also making more than 12 million barrels of crude oil available to domestic refiners. And the Environmental Protection Agency has waived clean-air rules nationally to allow for the use of a greater variety of fuel. Yesterday, it also issued a special exemption for fuel used in Atlanta. Mr. Brockwell said it was impossible to say how many gas stations would run out. But at least 30 percent of stations east of the Rockies may start running on empty, he said. Stations that are pumped dry over the weekend could have to wait days before getting another shipment. ''If you had unusually high demand and your supplies were diminished two days earlier than usual, then they won't rush you a new supply,'' said Richard Cobb, executive director of the Georgia Petroleum Council. Watching all of this at a distance, policy makers in Albany and New York City proposed measures to ease the pain at the pump. Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, has proposed capping state sales taxes at $2 a gallon, saving the motorist 8 to 10 cents a gallon, according to his estimate. The State Assembly, which has a majority of Democrats, however, has no plans for a special session, but will instead hold hearings. Dina Improta, a spokeswoman for the city Department of Consumer Affairs, which inspects the city's 14,000 pumps at 1,200 gasoline stations, said there was no ''vast emergency.'' ''If there was a vast emergency in the city where there was no gas,'' Ms. Improta said, ''our officials would be aware of it, and I have not heard anything about that.'' In Brooklyn, at least one station, an Amoco on 4th Avenue, ran out of gas at 3:30 p.m., and livery-cab drivers had come up with their own ways to conserve fuel. Many were lined up at a nearby subway station. ''Three days ago I stopped driving around looking for customers,'' said Moin Mohammed, 37, of Queens. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE OIL SUPPLY"
"Amber Wyrick sat alone in a temporary office set up by the Harrison County coroner, wiping at tears. Five days after the storm, she had yet to hear word about her 1-year-old son, Danny, who was with his father when Hurricane Katrina hit. His house was gone. ''I feel like in my heart I would know if something was wrong with him,'' Ms. Wyrick said. But she started to cry again. ''It's just not knowing that hurts so bad.'' Scores of people here have a relative or friend whose fate is unknown. While Internet message boards have linked many on the outside seeking news, those on the coast have no access to any form of communication more reliable than a message in a bottle. People have lost not only their telephone service, but also their addresses. As rescue workers struggled to inspect hard-to-reach areas, anxiety was mounting. Only half of Bay St. Louis and Waveland, two of the most damaged areas, had been canvassed, said Joe Spraggins, the Harrison County director of emergency management, at a morning briefing. Forty-five percent of Biloxi had been searched. So little of Diamondhead and Pearl River had been accessible that the Federal Emergency Management Agency rated them as zero percent searched, Mr. Spraggins said. There were 105 confirmed deaths in Harrison, Jackson, Pearl River and Hancock Counties. So desperate are people to communicate that when a T-Mobile office in Gulfport put out a sign that said ''free calls,'' 1,500 people lined up over two days, the managers said. There was tearful call after tearful call, with one relieved mother even insisting that her daughter pass the phone to a T-Mobile employee so she could thank him. But by Friday, the office had run out of fuel for the generator that powered its signal tower. One woman, an evacuee from New Orleans, said she was trying to reach her family so they could come get her. Another man was trying to tell his mother, a stroke victim, that he had made it through the storm. Thousands of calls have poured in to a toll-free number set up by The Sun Herald, a local newspaper, which has published items like ''Mary Hudson, looking for half brother, fire chief Tommy Stone,'' or ''Sylvia Hickey, Mobile, Alabama, is fine.'' But that avenue is inaccessible to many, because the power is out and telephone and cellphone service come only in blips. Luanne Thompson, 38, said she had no idea where her infant son might be; he had been in a New Orleans hospital after surgery. ''All I know is what I'm hearing on the radio, and I'm hearing they're evacuating everyone,'' she said. ''Over there they gave me an 800 number for the Red Cross, but other than that I don't know who to call.'' A spokeswoman for the American Red Cross said the toll-free phone line was not yet staffed. But, she said, there was a place on the organization's Web site for families to reconnect. Calls by a reporter to more than 20 hospitals across the South located Ms. Thompson's baby, Sonny Ray Thompson, at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. ''We didn't know how we were going to find his mother,'' said his nurse, Adrienne Arnold. Ms. Wyrick lost her house to the hurricane and only narrowly rescued her other three children, 2, 3 and 5, in a boat. Her search for her youngest son began with a trip to Gulf Port Estates in Ocean Springs, where Danny's father had lived. But deputies stopped her, telling her the area had been demolished. She was not satisfied. ''I tried to find a way around them, I can't lie,'' she said. ''I kept telling my father-in-law, 'Just drop me off, let me go, I'll walk.''' She checked shelters along the coast and visited the police every hour. On Friday, someone directed her to a ''family assistance center'' run by the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team, a division of FEMA. After filling out an eight-page form that asked for information about dental records and identifying marks, Ms. Wyrick learned that the information would go only to the county coroner, not to shelters and other places where missing people might have gone. Cotton Howell, the regional commander of the mortuary team, said that the specialists who run the centers had not arrived and that communications systems were not in place to share information with other relief agencies. There was also the problem of locating families who made reports to tell them if a body had been found. They were asked to provide their current location, possible future contact information and the name of a relative outside the disaster area. ''People who come in for missings don't have a fixed address, so we have to ask much deeper questions,'' Mr. Howell said. Some of those searching were themselves missing. ''My boss had accounted for everyone but me,'' said Marla Hemphill, an administrator at Northrop Grumman, who had come in to report that she suspected her sister, who lived in Biloxi and refused to evacuate and leave her pets, might be dead. Like so many others, she had gone to inspect the damage herself. The roof of her sister's house had collapsed, Ms. Hemphill said, and the house had a terrible odor. ''The front porch was still there with a table with a coffee cup on it,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''But the whole house slid backwards.'' Some people outside the disaster area have been so worried they have simply gotten in their cars and made the trip. Charles D. Widgeon, 48, and his brother Charles W., 38, saw their brother on television after the storm and came from Columbus, Ga., to find him. ''We've been to every shelter; none of them have a check-in list,'' the elder Mr. Widgeon said. ''At the hospital, they don't even know who all they got in there.'' For two days, they drove around, he said Thursday night, finding only their brother's car. By then, they themselves needed to be rescued. ''We're out of gas and out of money,'' Mr. Widgeon said. They had spent the night in a shelter and were waiting for their mother, driving from Columbus, to come pick them up. Some people coped with the uncertainty by throwing themselves into the recovery effort. ''My brother stayed on the beach,'' said John Boudreaux, who was helping run a shelter at Orange Grove Elementary in Gulfport, with a shrug that suggested he knew that many others shared his predicament. ''I don't know if he's dead or alive.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE MISSING"
"Do not be misled by Congress's approval of $10.5 billion in relief for the Hurricane Katrina victims. That's prompted by the graphic shock of the news coverage from New Orleans and the region, where the devastation catapults daily, in heartbreaking contrast with the slo-mo bumblings of government. There are dozens of questions Americans will demand to have answered once this emergency has passed. If the Homeland Security Department was so ill prepared for a natural disaster that everyone knew was coming, how is it equipped to handle other kinds of crises? Has the war in Iraq drained the nation of resources that it needs for things like flood prevention? Is the National Guard ready to handle a disaster that might be even worse, like a biological or nuclear attack? One thing is certain: if President Bush and his Republican Congressional leaders want to deal responsibly with a historic disaster of this scale, they must finally try the path of honestly shared national sacrifice. If they respond by passing a few emergency measures and then falling back on their plans to enact more tax cuts, America will have to confront the fact that it is stuck with leaders who neither know, nor care, how to lead. The pre-Katrina plan for this Congressional season was to enact more upper-bracket tax cuts for the least needy, while cutting into the safety-net programs for sick and impoverished Americans. These are the very entitlement programs most needed by the sudden underclass of hundreds of thousands of hurricane refugees cast adrift like Dustbowl Okies. Will Congress dare to go forward with these retrogressive plans in the face of the suffering from Katrina? Its woeful track record suggests that, shockingly, the answer may be yes. G.O.P. leaders are set to mandate billions in Medicaid and antipoverty cuts this month, while the Senate is poised to try again to repeal the estate tax, a monumental folly that will deprive the deficit-ridden government of an estimated $750 billion in vital revenue in the first decade. The theory is that over the long run, the missing money will ''starve the beast'' and force Washington to make huge cuts in federal programs. The public has never bought this, but as long as the economy held up, it was willing to ignore the long-term implications. That can't be the case now, when those implications are sitting in filthy refugee centers, when the streets of New Orleans are under water and when the nation must take care of hundreds of thousands of homeless people. Yet President Bush has still managed to repeat his no-taxes mantra. Senator Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat, is now fighting for every available dollar to restore her state. Republicans had been wooing Ms. Landrieu as a possible supporter of the estate tax repeal. Now, we presume, she has higher priorities. Washington's inspiration must now be the individual rescuers in New Orleans, who have labored so bravely and selflessly, as well as the charitable deeds of local and state governments. Houston's offer of shelter at the Astrodome has put self-regarding national politicians to shame. Congress and the president had better get the message: an extraordinary time is upon the nation. The annihilation in New Orleans is an irrefutable sign that the national tax-cut party is over. So is the idea that American voters cannot be required to accept sacrifice or inconvenience, no matter how great the crisis. This country is better than that. Editorial"
"A sequined Venus Williams turned into her own promoter last night, stealing a page from professional wrestling, or perhaps a cue card from her reality show. Minutes after she advanced to the fourth round of the United States Open with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Daniela Hantuchova, Williams turned to the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd and barked into the microphone: ''Are you guys ready for the Williams sisters? Yeah! We'll see you on Sunday.'' Suddenly, what used to be an awkward but inevitable family get-together became a public-relations picnic -- even if the sisters would rather not be playing each other this soon. Serena Williams, who eliminated Francesca Schiavone, 6-3, 6-4, yesterday afternoon, will join Venus on center court at the United States Open for the first time since they met in the 2002 prime-time finals. They also met in the 2001 final. ''It's obviously extremely disappointing to have to play my sister in the next round,'' Serena said in anticipation of her sister's victory a few hours later. Although Venus, seeded 10th, won Wimbledon this year and Serena, seeded eighth, won the Australian Open, the sisters' world rankings had dropped because of injury and inactivity, causing them to end up in the same section of the draw. ''It would be nice to be higher in the rankings, but it just seems like I can't keep up,'' Venus said of her one regret about meeting her sister. The two will play earlier in a Grand Slam event than they have since they first came on Tour as teenagers, when they wore plastic beads in their braided hair. Now Venus, 25, and Serena, 23, who own a combined 12 Grand Slam titles, wear weighty jewelry and constantly try to polish their image. Serena's expensive diamond earrings and necklace -- all on loan -- have raised eyebrows at this tournament, and Venus was criticized after saying on Wednesday that she knew little about Hurricane Katrina and the devastation it had caused along the Gulf Coast because ''sometimes it's better not to know.'' Both have tried to make amends. Serena even suggested her $100-per-ace contribution to relief efforts might not be enough. ''I need to start hitting more aces, my donation's going to be embarrassing,'' she said. ''It's not looking so good. I might have to double it at the end of this tournament.'' But then she grew defensive about her approach to charity. ''I think I actually made a very kind gesture out of nowhere,'' she said. '' I just decided in the middle of the match, you know, for every ace I hit, I want to donate money, stuff like that. So I don't get that one.'' Her aces brought her personal contribution to the Hurricane Katrina relief fund to $400 yesterday, $600 total, not including the planned auction of those $40,000 earrings that do not belong to her. The auction was the jewelry designer's idea, she said. Venus had to be prompted to explain how she joined in the former tennis player Zina Garrison's relief effort by sponsoring $1 yellow shoelaces for the flood victims. Serena chose not to discuss her sister's comments about being unaware of the hurricane and its effects. ''I'm definitely here to answer questions about me,'' she said. ''Like I said before, we're separate people, even though we do a lot of the same things.'' The two practiced together this week, and Venus insisted she would spend more time preparing to play her sister. Their Open finals tradition began in 2001, with Venus winning a ragged match under the lights. Serena won in straight sets the next year. Serena holds an 8-6 career record against Venus, although Venus beat her in their one meeting this season, in Miami. In their last five Grand Slam matches, Serena has defeated her sister every time, and she holds seven Slam titles to her sister's five. Asked how she prepares to play her sister, Serena joked: ''When I was winning all the Grand Slams, I poisoned her food. I may have to go back and do that again.'' To which Venus replied: ''She doesn't know I have a food-taster.'' Venus has also had the edge since the spring. Serena has been hampered by a sore left ankle and knee. She appeared winded as she sprinted to reach Schiavone's drop shots and screamed when she overhit. ''I am definitely playing better than I was even a week ago and two weeks ago,'' Serena said. ''I definitely think I'm getting better and better.'' Venus shrugged and said: ''It doesn't matter how Serena is playing because her competitive spirit is so high, you have to go to the ends of the earth to beat her.'' While the Williams sisters gave the day its intrigue and controversy, the rest of the seeded women marched onward, including Kim Clijsters, seeded fourth, and No. 1 Maria Sharapova. Sania Mirza, 18, yesterday became the first woman from India to advance to the fourth round. She came to her news conference with yet another T-shirt with a feisty saying: ''You can either agree with me or be wrong.'' Mirza defeated Marion Bartoli of France, 7-6 (4), 6-4, setting up a fourth-round match with Sharapova, who blew by Julia Schruff of Germany, 6-2, 6-4. Venus fought off six break points in her first service game and then rolled from there, racing to grab the microphone. To the crowd she promised there would be ''a lot of hard hitting, hard serving -- we'll both have a few tricks up our sleeves.'' She was asking the fans if they were prepared. By then, Serena, who had been watching in Venus's box, had ducked inside the stadium, knowing the question could have been directed at her. ''She's playing unbelievable,'' Serena said. ''I have to be ready.'' TENNIS"
"Military vehicles bearing food and supplies sloshed into the drenched heart of this humbled and stricken city on Friday, while commercial airplanes and cargo planes arrived to lift beleaguered hurricane survivors from the depths of a ghastly horror. Five days after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, the chaotic scene at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport evoked the mix of hope and despair that has gripped this city. Disorder prevailed, as thousands of survivors with glazed looks and nothing more than garbage bags of possessions waited in interminable lines for a chance to get out. Patrolmen yelled out the number of available seats on each flight, and passengers boarded planes not knowing where they would land, and not caring. An increasing number of cities and states across the country were offering to take them in. The airport was a stark landscape of triage, with rows of people on stretchers and others bound to wheelchairs, including someone already dead, in a wing that had been converted into the world's largest emergency room. A morgue had been set up in one concourse. The fresh wave of relief efforts came on a day when President Bush toured the ravaged region by helicopter and walked through the residue of Biloxi, Miss., before ending up in New Orleans, where he told survivors, ''I'm going to fly out of here in a minute, but I want you to know that I'm not going to forget what I've seen.'' Scores of amphibious vehicles and Humvees carrying thousands of newly dispatched armed National Guardsmen pushed through New Orleans in a daylong parade, hoping to replenish the dire needs of the stranded and to try to restore order to a city that had devolved into wantonness. In one sign of the boundless despair, police officials acknowledged that some New Orleans officers had turned in their badges, refusing to risk their lives to try to right the city. Another new ingredient was a spate of fires that broke out and were left to burn, because hydrants were not working and firefighters had no way to get to the blazes in the water-soaked city. Dan Craig, director of recovery for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, estimated that it could take six months to drain the city and another three months to dry it. State officials said that it would take more than a month, and that pumping would begin on Monday. In a city too bruised to know what to feel, many of the famished survivors applauded the arrival of the relief trucks, though others, enraged at how long their wait had been, showered them with profanities. A critical juncture was reached when the overwhelmed Superdome, the site of unimaginably squalid conditions, was mostly emptied by day's end. Thousands of other survivors, though, remained stranded in the putrid convention center. Others were said to remain perched on roofs, even this long after the storm. No one could convincingly say when the last of the living would be removed from the city, though state officials said they hoped to complete the process by Sunday. Dead bodies continued to present themselves at every turn. Medical authorities said 8 to 10 people an hour were dying at the city's hospitals. The supply convoy showed up just hours after Mayor C. Ray Nagin exploded in a radio interview on Thursday night, castigating the federal government, particularly FEMA, for what he felt was a lame and puny response to his city's needs. By Friday, about 19,500 National Guard troops had arrived in Louisiana and Mississippi, and 6,500 in New Orleans itself, mostly military police officers, though Mr. Nagin maintained that was still not enough. Senior Pentagon and military officials said the Guard presence in the hurricane zone would grow to 30,000 in coming days, mostly in Louisiana and Mississippi, with the rest going to Alabama and Florida. The guardsmen were posted at major intersections, and Army vehicles patrolled the streets, seeking to quell the looting and unrestrained crime that has shocked the nation. Some 300 members of the Arkansas National Guard, just back from Iraq, were among those deployed from foreign assignments specifically to bring order. ''I have one message for these hoodlums,'' said Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana. ''These troops know how to shoot and kill, and they are more than willing to do so if necessary.'' In the radio interview, Mayor Nagin blamed much of the widespread crime on crazed drug addicts cut off from their fixes. Lt. Gov. Steven Blum said in Baton Rouge, the capital, ''I am confident that within the next 24 hours we will see a dramatic improvement.'' Buses continued to wheel out of the city loaded with refugees from the Superdome and from around the convention center, the two principal shelters for those left behind, moving them to new, makeshift lives in the Houston Astrodome and other far-flung evacuation quarters like Reunion Arena in Dallas and a warehouse at KellyUSA, a city-owned complex in San Antonio. One evacuation bus carrying 50 people to Texas overturned on Interstate 49, near Opelousas, the police said, killing one person and injuring 17 others. Admissions to the Astrodome were halted after about 11,000 people had been accepted, fewer than half of what was planned, because officials felt it had become crowded enough. The Superdome, where upward of 25,000 people had sweltered in conditions described as unfit for animals, was mostly emptied, though 1,500 were still there late Friday. They had renamed the place, rife with overflowing toilets and reports of murder and rape, the Sewerdome. Edgar John Thead, 68, who sat with his 65-year-old wife, said he had been in line for the buses at 4 a.m., but had to withdraw because his diabetic wife could not stand the heat. ''I'll be the last one in line,'' he said. Throughout New Orleans, thousands of people, many of them among the city's poorest and most marginalized residents, were still unsure when and how they would get out. An estimated 20,000 were said to be at the four-story convention center, which at some points apparently attracted as many refugees as the Superdome but was ignored much longer by rescue operations. Conditions there were even worse than at the Superdome, with armed thugs seizing control and, the authorities said, repulsing squads of police officers sent to retake it. On Friday morning, people huddled in small groups inside the center or sat on orange folding chairs outside, a gruesome mockery of an actual convention. Amid overflowing toilets, an elderly women and a teenage boy were having seizures in the arms of relatives. Evacuees said that seven dead bodies littered the third floor. They said a 14-year-old girl had been raped. There was a pervasive feeling of abandonment. ''The trucks kept passing us up; they just kept going further east,'' said Louis Martin Sr., a truck driver who had been at the center since Tuesday. In the afternoon, P. Edwin Compass III, the superintendent of police, drove by on the running board of a van and shouted that food and buses were on the way. Some people responded with soft applause, while others jeered. A woman ran alongside the van, shrieking: ''We don't need food! Get us out of here!'' Throughout the city, where it was dry enough, people wandered in dazes. Along St. Charles Avenue, clumps of people trudged with plastic bags of belongings. Some had fled the violence of the convention center. Others searched for vans. Outside the Hyatt hotel next to the Superdome, scores of tour buses in ankle-deep water waited to evacuate people who had been living in and around the stadium. ''It's been hell,'' said Donnieka Rhinehart, 26, a nursing assistant who said she had lived in the stadium with her two small children since Monday. She said she saw a rape and heard that a girl's throat had been cut. The quickest way out of the city on Friday seemed to be the airport, after government officials arranged for more than a dozen airlines and cargo operators to volunteer planes to fly people to safety. But the lines never seemed to diminish. As soon as one flight took off, seven or eight helicopters would land on the tarmac with additional batches of survivors. Airport authorities did not know where the helicopters came from. ''Helicopters just appear,'' said Carolyn Lowe, a deputy director of the airport. Other cities and states continued to extend interim refuge and other forms of aid for the affected areas. Philadelphia announced that it was willing to take in a thousand families from New Orleans, and Detroit offered refuge as well. New York, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Georgia, California, Utah, Virginia and Washington were among other states offering to provide general support or take refugees. Some states promised to allow children of evacuees to enroll in their schools. During his tour of the area, President Bush kissed two weeping women who said they had lost everything in Biloxi, and he then walked down the street with his arms around them. Speaking about the rescue and relief efforts before leaving Washington, Mr. Bush acknowledged that ''the results are not acceptable'' and pledged to do more, saying the $10.5 billion in aid authorized by Congress was but a ''down payment'' on the disaster relief. In Washington, members of the Congressional Black Caucus called the federal response shameful, and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle promised hearings on what had gone wrong. That there was much peril remaining in New Orleans was without question. Before daybreak, an explosion tore through a warehouse along the Mississippi River, a dozen blocks or so from the French Quarter. And a fire at an oil storage facility across the river sent a plume of smoke across the city. The situation was terrifying at some of the city's hospitals for much of the day. Doctors, nurses and patients at Charity Hospital had to plead for help for more than 100 patients, who were later evacuated after violence had earlier prevented rescuers from getting in. Six patients had died during the wait for evacuation. Staff members were still inside, and some were reportedly keeping others alive with intravenous fluids. All were evacuated by the end of the day. Those who call New Orleans home and cherish its idiosyncratic stamp on the American landscape could only guess at what their city would look like and how broken it would be when the day came that the waters went away. The Army Corps of Engineers kept at the repair work on the broken levees that had allowed Lake Pontchartrain to thunder into the bowl-like city after it seemed that damage from the hurricane had ceased. And after three days of delays, the Corps and a swelling army of private contractors slowly began to set the stage for draining the hundreds of billions of gallons of floodwaters from the city. The plan was to close the holes that the storm tides had opened and break open new holes in places where the levees were holding water in the city rather than letting it out. A train of dump trucks and a yellow bulldozer began laying a narrow, temporary road of black rubble and gravel from dry ground to the north end of the 300-foot breach in a wall of the 17th Street Canal, through which most of the floodwaters passed. At the same time, heavy-lift helicopters lowered hundreds of huge sandbags into the south end of the gap. The height of the water in the streets and the adjoining lake had leveled off, so water was no longer rising. The authorities were hopeful that the breach could be slowly, if temporarily, blocked. At the same time, Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, commander of the Corps, said he was concerned about storms forming in the Atlantic. ''We want to make sure that we don't catch ourselves with levees open and have another storm front move in on us,'' General Strock said. Efforts to set life right again persisted throughout the Gulf Coast, as hundreds of thousands went on without electricity, and in many cases, homes. Relatives still sought feverishly to find loved ones. The number of deaths remained unknown, with estimates continuing to run into the thousands. Researchers who flew over 180 miles of coast between Pensacola, Fla., and Grand Isle, La., said that along the shore, for blocks inland, nothing remained but concrete slabs and chunks of asphalt. Often, they said, it was impossible to tell what had been there before the storm. There were more and more scattered signs of the crippling economic impact. A preliminary assessment from the oyster industry, one of Louisiana's flourishing seafood businesses, found that while the western side of the state fared well, everything east of Bayou Lafourche to the Mississippi line was ruined. The area accounts for two-thirds of the state's oyster harvesting, or $181 million a year. With federal aid, officials said, it could take two to three years for the crop to return. The frenzied pursuit of gasoline by motorists in the region did not slacken, and disruptions of routines continued. In Georgia, schools in Hancock County were closed on Thursday because of a gasoline shortage. Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia signed an executive order temporarily halting state collection of all motor fuel taxes, effective after midnight Friday. This should reduce gas prices by about 15 cents a gallon. Mr. Perdue said he hoped to keep the moratorium in effect through September, but needed the approval of the legislature, which will convene a special session starting Tuesday. ''I believe it's wrong for the state to reap a tax windfall in this time of urgency and tragedy,'' Mr. Perdue said. Other states were contemplating actions of their own. California announced that it was beginning an investigation into gasoline price gouging in the state. Meanwhile, in scattered camps in increasingly far-flung locations, countless thousands of refugees were fumbling to understand the next steps in their lives. Barry Mason, 54, of New Orleans traded a spot in the Superdome for a seat by the 40-yard-line in the Houston Astrodome. The Superdome was ''filled with all kinds of unbelievable filth, a screaming mess,'' he said, but spending the night in a chair was not much better. ''This is what they brought us to?'' Mr. Mason said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"The 1,200 members of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers were looking forward to their annual convention in New Orleans later this month, with its sessions on canine pack order, helping the shy dog and running a doggie day care center. After the serious business, they expected to relish the real fun: partaking all the delights New Orleans had to offer -- jazz, Cajun food, a tour of haunted houses, a bayou trip and a pub crawl. That is not to be. With the devastation from Hurricane Katrina, association officials scrambled this week to find another city to act as host to at least 1,000 trainers and a fair number of dogs. Several hundred other groups are rushing to do the same, as it is quite clear that for at least the rest of the year and probably longer, New Orleans will be closed to tourists. ''It's going to be a while before New Orleans is ready to host a meeting again,'' said Colin Rorrie, the president and chief executive for the Meeting Professionals International trade organization. Worrying about tourism and convention business amid the destruction in New Orleans and the surrounding gulf region is no misguided exercise. Tourism, as the city's main industry, is critical to its recovery. Last year, a record 10.1 million people visited New Orleans and spent $4.9 billion there. The tourist industry employed 81,000 people, almost 20 percent of the city's work force, said Stephen Perry, the president and chief executive of the convention and visitors bureau. Taking refuge in a small town north of New Orleans before setting up offices in Baton Rouge this week, Mr. Perry said that the tourism industry contributed nearly $250 million to the city last year from sales taxes on visitors' expenditures. Other cities in the region were just as dependent on tourism and hit just as hard. Mr. Rorrie estimated that at least $1 billion in meetings and convention business would be lost because of the storm. ''There's an overwhelming sense of, 'My God, this is a catastrophe beyond what anyone has experienced,''' he said. On its Web site, the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau still beckons: ''Welcome to America's most romantic, walkable, historic city.'' But not for the rest of this year, bureau officials are now saying, and possibly into next year. They have already canceled the 40 convention and trade shows scheduled for September that would have brought in 200,000 visitors, each spending an average of about $500 at hotels, restaurants and shops. Several hundred more conferences scheduled for the rest of the year will have to find other sites, too. They include numerous small military unit reunions, the Sweet Adelines International singing competition, a major Hewlett-Packard training event and a 20,000-member meeting of AARP. A number of conference planners and tourism officials in cities across the United States are saying that New Orleans' tourism industry could be still out of business when Mardi Gras begins at the end of February. That at least many of the smaller conventions planned for New Orleans can be moved at short notice speaks to the continued weakness in the trade show and convention business, particularly in less-desirable convention cities that find a hard time competing against flashier places like Las Vegas, Atlanta and New York. Indeed, only hours after the traumatic video of people stranded on rooftops, organizations like the National Association of Convenience Stores or the National Hardwood Lumber Association were fielding calls from convention bureaus in Detroit, Hartford, Pittsburgh and Albany. ''We didn't realize we were that popular,'' says Ruth Cameron of the Sweet Adelines, an international organization of women's choruses who sing in four-part harmonies. ''Apparently there are slow times in other cities.'' New Orleans is generally ranked as the fifth-largest convention city in the United States, after Las Vegas; Chicago; Orlando, Fla.; and New York. The riverside Ernest N. Morial Convention Center has 1.1 million square feet of exhibit space, the largest contiguous-space exhibit hall in the United States, with 12 exhibit halls and 140 separate meeting rooms, a 4,000-seat conference auditorium and 2 ballrooms. The center, from what officials can see, sustained little damage from the high winds. But since then, it has been a refugee center and a rather desperate one at that. Reports from inside the center describe dead bodies and overflowing toilets. ''Right now, we are out of resources at the convention center,'' Mayor C. Ray Nagin told reporters Thursday. ''Currently, the convention center is unsanitary and unsafe, and we are running out of supplies for 15 to 20,000 people.'' The trouble is magnified because many hotels and restaurants are in ruins. After the floodwaters are drained, airlines and the region's transportation system must be up and running before restoration can even begin. For the rest of the gulf region, tourism may be smaller but it is no less a lifeblood. The Mississippi Coast Coliseum and Convention Center in Biloxi, with 84,000 square feet of exhibition space, is a small site, ranked as the 204th-largest convention center by Tradeshow Week magazine. Nevertheless, said Stephen Richer, the executive director for the Mississippi Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which includes Biloxi and Gulfport, tourism is a $2-billion-a- year industry for his region. Meetings and conventions bring in at least $200 million of that. ''We're trying to assess the damage,'' Mr. Richer said. ''The basic fact is that all of the casinos have damage -- some of them very extensive. We've lost restaurants, museums, historic homes. The convention and visitors bureau office got washed away.'' Among the conventions lost is the annual meeting of the Mississippi Municipal League. The group rebooked the meeting in Biloxi after another hurricane, Dennis, wiped out their conference in July. ''I can't tell you how many of our 18,000 rooms are open,'' Mr. Richer said. But there won't be any conventiongoers in any of the usable hotels, he said. ''They will be filled with emergency workers and homeless residents."" The 1,740-room Beau Rivage hotel and casino in Biloxi, owned by MGM Mirage, was significantly damaged. ''We're not going to have anything there anytime soon,'' said Alan Feldman, senior vice president for public affairs at the company. The Beau Rivage accounted for about 4 percent of the company's net profits last year. The nation's tourism industry has reacted to the region's misfortunes in a sympathetic fashion. The Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau earlier this week offered several incentives to companies and organizations whose meetings were displaced by the hurricane. Dallas is trying to accommodate about a dozen requests to reschedule conventions at the moment, which would represent 200,000 room nights and, conservatively, an economic transfer of about $400 million. About two dozen hotels offered discounts to groups that wanted to move their conventions to Dallas. For groups that regularly rotate their meetings among a roster of cities, including Dallas and New Orleans, the city has offered to swap convention dates so New Orleans is guaranteed business in a later year. American Airlines, with a major hub in Dallas, has agreed not to assess destination change fees for group business relocating there. ''It was the right thing to do,'' said Phillip Jones, president and chief executive of the Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau, who also happens to have been Louisiana's secretary of tourism. ''Dallas has been able to step up and offer something to New Orleans during this crisis.'' Jeff Sacks, a vice president for the conference planning company Conferon Global Services, has noticed the same approach in other cities as he negotiates to find new sites for groups like the Sweet Adelines. ''The cities are all being very, very fair,'' Mr. Sacks said. ''It's like the way the industry treated New York City after 9/11. They don't want to turn a tragedy into a financial windfall, but they know it is a blessing.'' The dog trainers were able to book the Marriott hotel in San Jose, Calif., on the same dates they had planned for New Orleans. The hotel rooms will cost only $2 more than what they expected to pay in New Orleans. ''We are still in a state of amazement that we could pull this off,'' said Teoti Anderson, the group's president. (She is happy she signed an event-cancellation policy a few weeks ago that will cover much of the cost of the switch.) They may not get as many members to attend in San Jose; after all, they lost the after-hour allure of New Orleans. ''We are looking for things to do in San Francisco,'' Ms. Anderson said. Some cities appeared to be poaching. ''There are cities that are trying to take advantage of what is certainly a horrible thing,'' Mr. Rorrie of the meeting planners trade group said. He thinks the Dallas offer to swap is a ''good way to go,'' because it will help New Orleans get back on its feet later on. Other cities say they are only responding to need. Danielle Courtenay, spokeswoman for the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that ''it was never our intention to go out and poach meeting business.' ''We just got on the phone and said, 'Listen, we have some open space.''' ''We've been there,'' she said. ''We know what it feels like to be hit by a hurricane.'' The New Orleans convention employees, working out of offices in Washington, Chicago and Baton Rouge, are calling counterparts in other cities to give them business. While the New Orleans group has canceled all events in September, it will not make a decision about October events until next week. But most groups are already looking. Convention planners say that it is difficult finding alternatives at this short notice. But there is room out there. Mr. Sacks, the meeting planner for the Sweet Adelines, said he talked to 25 to 30 cities and 8 of them said they had availability. Hewlett-Packard had planned an H.P. Technology Forum training conference for 4,000 people the week of Sept. 11. The company's new chief executive, Mark V. Hurd, was scheduled to make his first public appearance before customers. The company has spent 18 months planning the event and must now scramble to move it in a matter of days. The most popular convention towns are solidly booked and meeting planners know that. But when asked, the big halls in Las Vegas, New York and Atlanta are looking for slots to fit in some conventions. ''The business will be spread out so it will not have a major impact in any one city,'' said Richard Heller, president of the Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas. No one is writing off New Orleans as a major convention city. ''I believe New Orleans convention business will rebound quickly,'' said Michael Hughes, director for research at Tradeshow Week. How fast the industry gets back on its feet, Mr. Perry of the New Orleans visitors bureau said, is critical to the city's recovery. ''From an economic point of view, the recovery of the tourism industry will be of significant help,'' he said. ''It will generate the revenue allowing the city to bounce back.'' ''We are taking a page out of Mayor Giuliani's handbook,'' Mr. Perry said. ''We will be saying, 'Don't just send your dollars. Come to New Orleans. Don't stay away.''' HURRICANE KATRINA: THE CONVENTION BUSINESS"
"Some were being given water by soldiers. Some had small spasms as they lay on their stretchers. Some psychiatric patients chewed their lower lips or babbled quietly. Some tried to wander out the doors where buses dropped off more patients. Some were dying; one corpse in a wheelchair, not far from the Delta counter, lay covered by a blue blanket. On the day that a fleet of military helicopters and buses with military escorts finally succeeded in emptying the exhausted and darkened hospitals in the city's flooded zones, the departures concourse of the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport had become the newest and most chaotic hospital in the New Orleans area. By evening, all the patients in the flooded zone had been moved out, though hundreds of medical personnel and frightened city residents who had sought shelter in hospitals from rising water were still hoping someone would come get them, too. Left behind were an unknown number lying dead in flooded morgues and sometimes in spare corridors. As the nation watched long lines of obviously fragile patients being wheeled down the tarmac, it was clear that some patients had died in transit -- the airport hospital has its own morgue -- and there were worrying hints that the forgotten nursing homes of New Orleans might ultimately be found to be worse charnel houses than the stranded hospitals. The head of a Louisiana ambulance service said he had been told of one home in lower St. Bernard's Parish where 80 patients had been found dead and of an apartment home for the blind where the staff had abandoned the residents. The reports could not immediately be confirmed. A Web site set up by The Times-Picayune newspaper in New Orleans at www.nola.com to encourage people to tell their stories had numerous detailed pleas from family members of elderly New Orleans residents saying they believed their relatives were trapped in nursing homes or apartment buildings, unable to make contact because they were bedridden or too senile to ask fleeing neighbors for help. Nonetheless, the situation for hospital patients had suddenly improved dramatically. Early on Friday morning, the scene at the airport looked ''extremely desperate'' in the eyes of Dr. Ross Judice, medical director for Acadian Ambulance Service, which even before Hurricane Katrina landed had contracts to evacuate many private hospitals. In a 4:30 a.m. phone call to his wife, Robin, in Lafayette, he described a chaotic situation in which the area meant for 250 already had 2,000 sick and injured patients, more were arriving every hour and the Federal Emergency Management Agency had no plans to evacuate any of them. It was hard just to move patients across the tarmac from helicopters, and Dr. Judice asked his wife to send out a plea for gurneys and medical golf carts with beds. He also asked her to recruit volunteers willing to fly in and act as stretcher bearers. ''Somebody's got to get this thing rolling,'' his wife reported him saying. By 9:30 a.m., Mrs. Judice said, he had called back and ''there was tremendous relief in his voice.'' The military had arrived with transports and chartered commercial jets were landing. ''Patients were being moved out and he felt that there was definitely a plan,'' she said. By Friday afternoon, there were only a few hundred patients at the airport. With hundreds of National Guard troops spreading out in the city streets, it was finally easier for small boats to approach embattled hospitals, some of which were surrounded by six feet of floodwater and had little or no electricity and no running water. At the same time, the fleet of helicopters evacuating patients from rooftops had grown from a handful of single-patient civilian ambulances just after the storm to about 100 military medevac choppers. The evacuations came in the nick of time for several hospitals, where doctors had been working by flashlight and helping patients breathe with manual ventilators, waiting helplessly for news from the outside. Some staff members were so hungry and dehydrated that they were reported to be feeding themselves intravenous sugar solutions. Although helicopters had delivered food and water to some hospitals, it was limited and rationed. Richard Zuschlag, the president of Acadian Ambulance, described a hellish week for his helicopter and ambulance crews from his command center in Lafayette. Mr. Zuschlag said he had begged the governor, senators, Pentagon and FEMA officials for more help as the crisis deepened. The evacuation was so chaotic, he said, that ''At Touro Infirmary, these mothers were just giving my medics their little day-old babies. They were just looking at us with fear and horror on their faces. We would put four of them in an incubator and just fly them out. They're scattered all over the country now. We couldn't keep track of where everyone was going.'' All the babies, he said, had identification bracelets on, so that their mothers would presumably be reunited with them. A spokesman for the hospital later said he had little idea where the evacuated patients were. At Charity Hospital, which was not evacuated until Friday evening, Mr. Zuschlag said, ''When we first tried to get medics there, in Fish and Wildlife boats, people shot shots at us, tried to turn our boats over. It would be O.K., and then there'd be pockets of thugs where it was terrible.'' Early on Friday morning, at University Hospital, a public institution with many patients on welfare, Dr. Joan James, an obstetrician, said in a telephone interview that it was getting harder and harder to take care of the patients. Dr. James was among the last to be evacuated from the hospital by airboat. Only four of the eight floors were usable, and the water outside was so deep that fish were cruising past, she said. Intensive care and dialysis patients had been evacuated earlier in the week, but each had to be taken out by boat to another nearby hospital with a helicopter landing pad. The hospital was out of running water, had no ventilation and food that had been had been airlifted in was limited. Backup generators powered only the operating rooms and a few other areas, so the staff was using flashlights and stethoscopes to diagnose patient problems. ''We can't tell a lot from monitoring a fetal heartbeat,'' Dr. James said. ''People are starting to get frustrated. Luckily, we haven't had anyone get too violent.'' Don Smithburg, the chief executive officer of the Louisiana State University Hospital, which oversees the public hospitals, told The Associated Press, ''Our morgue at Big Charity is full and it is under water.'' The basement morgue had 12 bodies and another five were stacked in a stairwell, also under water, and other bodies were left elsewhere in the hospital, he said. At Touro Infirmary Hospital, two private buses were able to get the last of its 2,000 employees and patients out of the hospital by the end of Thursday, Stephen Kupperman, the hospital's chairman, said. The hospital also hired private air ambulances to transfer patients. ''We could not get any assistance from the government at first,'' said Mr. Kupperman, who said about 80 patients transferred from the hospital were moved by government helicopters the last day. ''My view is that the government was totally unprepared for something of this size,'' he said. By this morning, Tulane University Hospital had been able to evacuate some 1,400 patients, employees and others, largely by leasing 20 private helicopters. HCA, which operates Tulane, started making arrangements to move people a week ago, said Ed Jones, a vice president. The company has also been able to move some 50 Charity patients, many of whom are critically ill. Tenet Healthcare hired five private helicopters to try to get 3,000 patients and employees out of four of its hospitals , said a spokesman, Steven Campanini. Among the few hospitals still operating in the area is the Oschner Clinic Foundation, which is not flooded. But after several of its generators failed, the clinic had no clean water and chose to transfer about 200 of its 45o patients to Houston. Oschner now has power and supplies, allowing it to reopen its emergency department, according to Dr. Joseph Guarisco, the department's chairman. ''The crisis is clearing up rapidly,'' Dr. Guarisco said. Now hospitals and public officials face the daunting task of trying to locate patients. ''Our patients are scattered,'' said Mr. Kupperman of Touro Infirmary. '' We don't really know where they are.'' At Kindred Hospital, an acute-care center in the Garden District, workers and patients were taken out in four tour buses on Friday morning. Hospital workers said they had been told that they would be evacuated several times this week but the buses never arrived. On Thursday morning, three dozen patients were brought to the hospital lobby but then had to sleep on the floor. Bridget A. Jatho, who worked in the psychiatric ward, said that the 11 patients in her unit frequently grew restive during the week but that only one fight broke out. At the airport, Jack Rimp, who retired to New Orleans after a career in theatrical advertising in New York, surveyed the scene in a wheelchair, his hospital gown neat around his knees, a green oxygen tube beside his chair, a card hanging over his neck identifying him as an emphysema patient. Mr. Rimp was evacuated by helicopter from Memorial Medical Center on Wednesday, and been at the airport ever since. ''After three nights, it's really fine,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE HOSPITALS"
"WITH each passing day -- sometimes, it seemed, each hour -- the news grew worse. After Hurricane Katrina missed a head-on collision with New Orleans, there was hope that the storm's 175 m.p.h. winds might not have had a chance to do as much damage as feared. But then came reports of breached levees, beached oil rigs, widespread flooding -- and, perversely, fires. Estimated death tolls rose from dozens to hundreds; Mayor Ray Nagin said perhaps 1,000 people or more had perished in New Orleans alone, even before the looting and gunplay erupted. The agony in Louisiana and Mississippi all but overwhelmed news of a new round of business-related criminal indictments and statistics showing that even as the economy rebounded from the last recession, poverty has grown and family incomes, for the first time on record, fell for five consecutive years. KATRINA'S FURY -- Natural disasters have struck before, of course, and many have been both deadly and devastating. But none may measure up to the effect of Hurricane Katrina, which tore up the Louisiana delta and southern Mississippi. Beyond the human toll, which is still being tallied and may be considerable, the hurricane did extensive damage to the nation's oil and gas resources, and it may take weeks or months to repair it all. The storm idled offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, which accounts for more than one-fifth of the nation's oil production, and disabled eight major refineries, which by themselves account for 10 percent of the country's total refining capacity. Crude oil prices spiked above $70 a barrel -- nominally a record, but still below the inflation-adjusted peak of $86 a barrel in March 1981 -- but the pinch came first in the market for fuels. Gasoline jumped to $2.68 a gallon on average nationwide, the highest price ever without adjusting for inflation, according to AAA. In many cities, regular gasoline was sold for more than $3.30 a gallon; where spot shortages developed, including North Carolina and Georgia, prices shot up to as high as $5.87 a gallon for regular. Jet fuel prices also soared, but spot shortages cropped up nonetheless; about half of the jet fuel sold in the United States is refined along the Gulf Coast. Shipping was also hit particularly hard, which is bad news for farmers and others who use the Mississippi River to take products to market. Exports that usually move in bulk through the stricken area's ports, roads and rail lines are likely to face disruptions for weeks, if not longer. The storm also left 18 percent of the residents of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi and some small regions of Florida without power, according to the Department of Energy. Estimates of privately insured losses -- which is guesswork at this point, with much of New Orleans still under as much as 20 feet of water -- range from $15 billion to $25 billion and could surpass the inflation-adjusted total of $22 billion incurred by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Damage from flooding, which private insurers do not cover, could double the figure. One disaster-management firm estimated total losses could exceed $100 billion. GIMME SHELTERS -- KPMG, the accounting firm, agreed to pay $456 million to avoid being indicted for creating and selling tax shelters that it acknowledges were illegal, but eight of its former partners were not so lucky. They were indicted, along with a lawyer who did not work for the firm, for conspiring to defraud the government by promoting the shelters and then trying to hide them from the Internal Revenue Service. A criminal indictment would have been a near-certain death knell for KPMG. A single criminal count, of obstruction of justice, was enough to kill another major accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, in 2002. That charge was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court, but too late to save Andersen. In addition to agreeing to pay the penalty, which works out to about $300,000 for each of the firm's 1,500 partners, KPMG accepted a deferred-prosecution agreement under which it will engage an outside monitor and limit its tax practice until Dec. 31, 2006. PAY FALLS, POVERTY RISES -- Household incomes have failed to increase for five consecutive years -- the first time that has happened since the Census Bureau started keeping records -- and the number of people living in poverty increased last year. The bureau's annual report on the nation's economic well-being showed that a four-year economic expansion had not prevented the median pretax household income from declining to $44,389 last year. That is its lowest point since 1997, after adjusting for inflation. At the same time, the poverty rate for working-age people, those ages 18 to 64, rose last year. The portion of people age 65 and older in poverty fell, while child poverty was essentially flat. Over all, the poverty rate increased to 12.7 percent, from 12.5 percent in 2003. Consumer confidence jumped last month, regardless of the bureau's findings. The next report on consumer confidence, which will reflect the effects of Hurricane Katrina, is due Sept. 27. WHISTLE-BLOWER DEMOTED -- Bunnatine H. Greenhouse, a civilian in the Army's procurement bureaucracy, had publicly opposed awarding long-term multibillion-dollar contracts to the Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root without competitive bidding in 2003. Last June, she told a Congressional panel that one of the awards was ''the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career.'' The Army demoted her last week, an action that her lawyer, Michael Kohn, described as an ''obvious reprisal'' for challenging the Halliburton contracts; Dick Cheney was the company's chief executive before he became vice president. The Army said Ms. Greenhouse's demotion was based on her performance and was not in retaliation for any disclosures of possible improprieties. Mr. Kohn said the Army's inspector general was investigating the matter. FIVE DAYS"
"As thousands of National Guard soldiers entered New Orleans on Friday to help restore order and deliver emergency supplies, Pentagon and Guard officials said the military's response had been slowed by a combination of physical obstacles created by the storm compounded by a cumbersome bureaucratic process for sending federal forces to assist in natural disasters. State officials in Louisiana and Mississippi said they had overcome the absence of some 8,000 of their National Guard troops who are deployed to Iraq by drawing on Guard members from other states, but not until after the storm had passed and the magnitude of the emergency had become clear. Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré, commander of the joint task force coordinating military efforts in hurricane relief, defended the prestorm preparations by the National Guard and Pentagon, including the positioning of 10,000 National Guard troops in five Gulf Coast states. But he acknowledged that the storm damage had caught military planners off guard. Floodwaters, debris-clogged streets and crippled communications hampered initial rescue efforts. States outside the most heavily damaged area held off sending more Guard members until the storm had passed. Even after the Guard reinforcements began arriving, he said it took a long time to load and dispatch relief trucks with supplies. ''If you ever have 20,000 people come to supper, you know what I'm talking about,'' General Honoré told CNN in New Orleans on Friday. By Friday, about 19,500 National Guard troops had arrived in Louisiana and Mississippi, and 6,500 in New Orleans itself, mostly military police officers. Senior Pentagon and military officials said the National Guard commitment to the hurricane zone would grow to 30,000 in coming days. Over all, the active and reserve military commitment to hurricane relief could reach 50,000 troops. The aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman is steaming to the Gulf Coast to serve as a command post for the various warships contributing to disaster relief. By this weekend, more than 500 marines from Camp Lejeune, N.C., will arrive in Louisiana by air and sea, bringing with them equipment for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, including water purification devices, seven-ton trucks, dump trucks, forklifts, generators and Humvees. Over all, more than 150 military and Coast Guard helicopters are now ferrying supplies, conducting search and rescue missions, and other operations. U-2 spy planes have been sent aloft for a better picture of hurricane and flood damage. Army officials said units at several bases, including Fort Hood, Tex., and Fort Bragg, N.C., were notified Thursday to stand by in case thousands of soldiers and dozens of helicopters were needed to assist in the rescue and relief operations. The Pentagon's response in this case, which critics have called slow and insufficient, illustrates the tension between civilian control of domestic disasters and how far forward the military can prepare in advance of official requests for help. The five states in the storm's path had each called up their own National Guard troops, including about 7,000 soldiers and airmen who were mobilized in Louisiana and Mississippi, said Maj. Gen. Ron Young, a senior staff officer for the National Guard Bureau. But other states waited until after the scale of the destruction became clear to call up their own Guard units and send them to Louisiana and Mississippi. Governors in those states would not have called up those units without assurance that they would get federal disaster assistance to pay for the additional troops, he added. President Bush declared a state of emergency on Saturday, before the storm struck, but too late for troops from other states to position themselves closer before the storm hit, even if they had been called up. ''They could not stand up 5,000 and 6,000 Guardsmen on state active duty not knowing if they were even going to be needed,'' General Young said. It is not entirely clear yet what impact the American operations in Iraq have had on the hurricane relief mission. With more than 25,000 of the 40,000 marines stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., deployed to western Iraq, a Marine spokesman, Capt. David Nevers, said it was more ''challenging'' to assemble the right mix of marines and aircraft to deploy to Louisiana, but still workable. Some critics have attributed the slow response partly to the deployment of the Louisiana and Mississippi National Guards to Iraq. Military officials acknowledged that the Iraq deployments strained the Guard ranks in those states, but the governors could request Guard soldiers from other states. By happenstance, the 4,000 troops of the Louisiana Army National Guard's 256th Brigade Combat Team are ending their yearlong tour in Iraq and will begin returning home in the next few weeks. The planning complexities also slowed the Pentagon's preparations for sending active duty units. Officials said that though Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told the uniformed services to be ''forward-leaning'' in readying units for deployment, military officials did not want to appear to be elbowing aside civilian officials in responding to the disaster. Nor could they anticipate the scale of the damage. As a result, the Pentagon planning started only days before the storm reached the Gulf Coast and even then was small-scale and impromptu. Navy officials, for example, said their prehurricane planning began last Saturday when a half-dozen ship commanders in Norfolk, Va., and Baltimore were warned their vessels could have to deploy to the gulf to assist. Even a Navy vessel that is on call for possible deployment to sea takes 24 to 48 hours to get under way, but these had to be loaded with supplies for storm victims, a process that took several days. The first of these ships did not leave until Wednesday. STORM AND CRISIS: THE MILITARY RESPONSE"
"LAST year on that horrible date of Sept. 11, two women from Russia played for the championship of the United States Open. Svetlana Kuznetsova from St. Petersburg beat Elena Dementieva from Moscow, and then they stood together and reminded the fans to never forget the terror that had struck New York in 2001 or the schoolhouse in Beslan, Russia, only eight days earlier. ''It seems so little,'' Kuznetsova told the fans, acknowledging that nothing could bring all those slaughtered people back to life. That night I wrote, ''In one pampered, irrelevant, silly little corner of the city, the golden door was shining for two guests who brought honor to both nations.'' At the very least, these two athletes from Russia had demonstrated dignity and awareness of events off the court. That's not a lot to ask, is it? Compassion is nice; money is better. Athletes make such obscene sums of money that it is reasonable to ask what they are putting back. Yesterday, Lance Armstrong, in an e-mail message to this newspaper, made a pledge of $500,000 from himself and his foundation to provide ongoing treatment for cancer patients who have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina. That figure matched the donation from the United States Tennis Association, the host of the Open. As the major American sports event going on at this moment, the Open provides an absurd contrast between its wealthy patrons and the destitute people of the Gulf Coast. Yesterday, shortly after winning her match, Maria Sharapova sat in a studio under the eaves of Arthur Ashe Stadium and read from the prompter: ''Hi, I'm Maria Sharapova. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina has affected hundreds of thousands of lives. You can help now by making a contribution to the American Red Cross. Thank you.'' To make it easier for tennis patrons to pitch in, starting tomorrow, representatives of the Red Cross will be at the east gate of the National Tennis Center, eager to receive money for the relief drive. Clicking a credit-card number onto a Web site for the American Red Cross or the Salvation Army seems almost like an abstraction, although surely worth doing, early and often. The frustration radiates outward, certainly toward a government that has seemed committed to downsizing its responsibilities. However, frustration keeps going toward any moving target -- including those earrings glittering on Serena Williams's earlobes, or maybe that vapid disconnect emanating from Venus Williams, who is so remote she might as well be named Pluto. On Wednesday, Venus was asked if she had watched the television coverage from New Orleans. ''No, I don't really watch the news,'' Williams said, recalling how she had to ask why her flight to New York was delayed last week. ''In some ways, I'm very unaware of the latest happenings of the world,'' she added. ''I kind of leave it like that because sometimes it's better not to know.'' A few minutes later, Venus gave copious evidence of knowing way too much about some '70's reality show. Last night, after advancing to meet her sister tomorrow, Venus said, ''At the end of the day, I wish I could do something. It's a sad time. They're in my prayers.'' Her sister Serena at first announced that she was donating $100 for every ace she fired for the rest of the year, but after firing only six in two matches, she noted yesterday that she might have to double her pledge. Serena seemed a little stung by suggestions she was not doing enough, so she revealed that the earrings she had worn would be auctioned on the Women's Tennis Association Web site (WTATour.com) after the Open. Of course, the earnings belong to Serena's designer. She says she's too cheap to buy jewelry like that. Williams is not the only player at the Open who is raising money. James Blake, who plays Rafael Nadal this afternoon, has put up 10 autographed rackets for auction starting tomorrow, via his Web site, jamesblaketennis.com. Andre Agassi admitted he could not watch much of the tragedy on television, but in his 20th Open he is wise enough to address the spectacle of Americans drowning in the streets of New Orleans. ''Well, certainly, helpless is a fair word to use,'' Agassi said, adding, ''You look at the tsunami that hit and you think, 'Geez, how long does that stay in the news?' Is it how long people care about it? But those lives are still affected. And this is going to continue for a long time. I mean, schools and hospitals.'' It's easy for us to whack away at the obtuseness of the Williams sisters. But as the two Russian players reminded us last year, even in these foolish little corners of sports, reality sometimes intrudes. Maybe the Armstrong donation and the U.S.T.A. donation will remind the rest of us to kick in. Sports of The Times E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com"
"Among the many businesses in the New Orleans area left reeling from Hurricane Katrina, Fair Grounds Race Course will not conduct its 2005-6 meet on site. Churchill Downs Inc., which owns the track, made the announcement yesterday and also said the meet would probably be held at Louisiana Downs, a Harrah's track about 350 miles northwest of New Orleans in Bossier City. Tom Meeker, the president and chief executive of Churchill Downs, said the Fair Grounds barn area and racing surfaces were under about four feet of water. The grandstand is above water, but part of the track's roof sustained damage. No horses were stabled at the track when the hurricane hit. Meeker said Churchill Downs management was concentrating on locating the 500 employees who work at Fair Grounds. So far, about 150 have been found. Seven employees from the security department remained at the track during the hurricane, but they were ordered to evacuate Thursday because of unrest and violence nearby. The Fair Grounds meet was supposed to run from Nov. 24 through March 26. Meeker said plans could be finished next week for a temporary meet at Louisiana Downs. It was unclear how long that meet would be, but expectations were that it would be far shorter than the one that had been scheduled. Any profits would be donated to hurricane relief efforts. ''There will be myriad problems in moving the meet,'' Meeker said. ''But at a time like this, those problems look much smaller, given the circumstances people are facing. Our primary thing is to provide an opportunity for our horsemen to have a place to run for some substantial purses. ''And we believe that by running a meet there, we can provide some additional funding to horsemen or employees of the track who now find themselves in need.'' Meeker gave no specifics concerning the future of the Fair Grounds, which opened in 1852 and was rebuilt after a fire in 1993. ''We invested in this community because we liked it,'' Meeker said. ''The nexus between that track and that community is a mirror image of what the nexus is here in Louisville, Kentucky. There is a great tradition down there in that community associated with that racetrack. ''We are firmly committed, with other business leaders and investors in that community, to re-establish New Orleans over the course of the next years or whatever it will take to get that city back on its feet.'' The hurricane did not damage Louisiana Downs, which is just outside Shreveport and has had racing all week. The handle has dropped since the hurricane because Fair Grounds and its off-track betting shops have been closed for simulcast betting since Katrina hit. ''There are horsemen in this state who have raced over the years at the Fair Grounds and horsemen who race at Churchill Downs who would be faced with a real problem if there is no racing at the time Fair Grounds is supposed to run,'' said Ray Tromba, Louisiana Downs's vice president for racing operations. ''We're glad to consider any thoughts and ideas Churchill has about racing here. We realize this is an important issue for the racing industry, particularly here in Louisiana, and we will be glad to help.'' HORSE RACING"
"The major electric utilities in the storm-damaged Gulf Coast region have restored power to some areas less directly affected by Hurricane Katrina and to numerous hospitals, some key oil operations and to the main airport of New Orleans. But like a slow-healing wound, the power grid remains in ugly condition at the heart of the multi-state region battered by the storm. About 1.6 million residential and business customers were still without power yesterday, according to the Department of Energy. Entergy, the largest utility in region and the service provider for New Orleans, had little progress to report in most of that city yesterday because of the flooding, although service was restored to hospitals and other critical users in drier western suburbs. A smaller company, Cleco, said that it had barely begun to turn on lights in northeastern Louisiana. And coastal Mississippi, served mainly by Southern Company's Mississippi Power unit, also remained almost completely blacked out with the exception of sites running on private generators. Restoring power to oil and gas production and distribution operations has been a priority. Entergy said that it had restored electricity to major refineries north of New Orleans but that power would not be delivered to three sites farther downriver for at least another week. The company said that it expected to restore power to one the two pumping stations that serve the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port by early Saturday but that the other would be out of service for another week. Southern Company, a utility holding company based in Atlanta, said that some of its other units in the region were faring better than Mississippi Power. Southern's Gulf Power subsidiary by yesterday had virtually completed repairs to its system that serves the Florida Panhandle region. Alabama Power, a larger Southern unit, said that 99 percent of its customers around Birmingham had power, although it did not expect to reach that level for the harder-hit Mobile region until Wednesday. ''We had 103,000 customers, or about 48 percent of our total, restored this morning and should get over 50 percent by the end of the day,'' Kenneth Coleman, area manager in Mobile for Alabama Power in a telephone interview yesterday afternoon. Mississippi Power, which serves 195,000 customers, did make substantial progress restoring service in the northern reaches of its territory. That includes Hattiesburg, a city of close to 50,000 that is about 75 miles inland from the coast. The renewed service sent Hattiesburg residents racing to stores and gasoline stations. ''People are lined up 50 yards deep at the market and it looks like a half-mile to the gas station,'' said Carl Hagstrom in a noontime conversation via a cellphone that he said had just begun to receive calls for the first time since the hurricane hit landfall early Monday. But most of Mississippi Power's network closer to the coast is not functioning and only 30 percent of its substations are back on line. ''We've got more than 4,000 outside employees helping them now,'' said Andrew J. Dearman III, chief transmission officer for Southern in Birmingham. ''We're keeping non-essential people, including executives like me, out of the area.'' A similar repair pattern is unfolding among Mississippi's electric cooperatives, which collectively serve about half the state's customers. Roughly 324,000 co-op customers, or 46 percent, were without service as of yesterday, with most of them in the southern portion of the state, according to Ronald L. Stewart, a spokesman for the Electric Power Associations of Mississippi trade group. In many cases, the co-ops are awaiting the restoration of service on major transmission lines owned by commercial utilities like Mississippi Power and Entergy from which they purchase power for local distribution. The restoration rate could slow down, Mr. Stewart said, because ''Now you are getting to the part where you have to rebuild transmission towers, not just remove trees.'' The limited availability of telephone communications is hampering progress. It had been so difficult to contact the Southern Pine Electric Association, a cooperative that operates a pumping station on Colonial Pipeline's petroleum products distribution network, that the White House on Thursday phoned the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, a trade group in Arlington, Va., for help in reaching Southern Pine to emphasize the high priority the government put on getting power restored for Colonial, according to Patrick Lavigne, a spokesman for the trade group. The station is now back on line, Mr. Stewart said. HURRICANE KATRINA: THE POWER GRID"
"Riding on the running board of a big white van, the city's highest-ranking police officer rolled up Friday afternoon to deliver the first scrap of good news that the 20,000 people holed up here in the squalid convention center had heard for nearly a week. ''We've got food and water coming,'' shouted the police superintendent, P. Edwin Compass III, microphone in hand. ''We've got buses that are going to take you out of here.'' The unannounced arrival of Mr. Compass, in a crisp navy-blue uniform, was a sudden and even surreal turn at this dank outpost of suffering, filled to bursting with the people who had flocked here days earlier to escape the floods of Hurricane Katrina, only to become a trapped horde of the hungry, the filthy and, here and there, the dead. Soft applause and cheers rippled in a rising and falling wave as Mr. Compass proceeded along the mile-long terrace front of the convention center, crammed 10-deep with exhausted men, women and children. ''Thank God!'' an elderly woman gasped. But some kept silent, any joy or relief tempered by skepticism that Mr. Compass and the city would deliver on one more set of promises. Others cursed, deeply resentful that they had been left to survive by their wits in the cavernous -- at night, pitch-dark -- convention center without food, water or protection from the thieves and thugs who they said had terrorized them. One angry man shouted over the applause, ''It's about time!'' A woman ran alongside Mr. Compass's van, shrieking at him: ''We're ready to go now. We don't need no food. Get us out of here!'' Standing at the curb, Glenda Cloud, 50, said: ''They can keep their food. We've got people dying in here.'' Meals were served, and Mr. Compass said that as night was falling, military helicopters lifted off with some of the most seriously ill storm victims. He said buses would arrive on Saturday for those without serious health problems. Just how many had died was not clear, though the breadth of the horror was in plain sight. On the sidewalk, a woman with short gray hair lay dead on her side, legs drawn up toward her belly. The elderly woman whose corpse had become a recurring image Thursday on the television news still lay slumped, a day later, in her wheelchair. Young and old swooned in the hot, fetid air. Also unclear was the extent of the violence that had been visited on the captive crowd. Although many repeated stories they had heard of rapes and killings, no refugees or officials could corroborate them. But perhaps the biggest question was how this foul scene came to exist in the first place, right in the center of the city, less than a mile from the Superdome and just south of the French Quarter, in a neighborhood frequented by tourists -- many of whom ended up here after their hotels became uninhabitable. On Tuesday, when the city's levees burst, one of the few remaining structures on dry land was this center -- officially the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center -- a huge, hangar-like building on high ground near the Mississippi River. Many refugees said they had come here after hearing directives on the radio that they do so, because the Superdome and other shelters were already filled. But Kenya Smith, head of intergovernmental relations for New Orleans, said Friday that the convention center was never designated an official shelter. Mr. Smith said that hotels, had apparently sent guests here under the impression that it was. At the convention center, he said, the refugees were told -- he was not sure by whom -- that FEMA would send buses to take them from the city. Yet federal officials were not even aware there was a crowd at the convention center for three days into the crisis, according to Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Brown told network television interviewers on Thursday night that federal officials had learned about the refugees just that day. ''Don't you guys watch television?'' Ted Koppel asked him on ''Nightline.'' ''Our reporters have been reporting about it for more than just today.'' Mr. Brown, who indicated that officials had heard word of the problem earlier but were too busy dealing with refugees at the Superdome to confirm it , said, ''We learned about it factually today that that's what existed.'' Mr. Compass, the police superintendent, indicated in an interview on Thursday that his department had been well aware of the crowd at the center. Some people had been brought here after being rescued from the floodwaters, he said, but ''most people just went in there'' on their own. He said many tourists took shelter here -- along with perhaps 100 armed thugs. ''The tourists are walking around there and as soon as these individuals see them, they're being preyed upon,'' Mr. Compass said. On Wednesday, Mr. Compass said he sent eight squads of 11 men each to take control of the convention center, but the first squad made it only 30 feet inside before being rushed by more than 50 people. The lawlessness was sometimes welcome. On Friday morning, some young men broke into the kitchen of the Marriott Hotel, across the street from the center, fixed a gigantic batch of scrambled eggs, grits and bacon and served it to storm victims. Henrietta Glover, 61, a former preschool teacher, said, ''We have some Robin Hood figures who have gone out and found milk and food for us and fixed food for us.'' Just before the police superintendent arrived, a convoy of 17 police and military vehicles, some with lights flashing and sirens wailing, sped past the convention center in an apparent show of force. Several military helicopters also hovered over the building. Shortly after Mr. Compass spoke to the refugees, 1,000 members of the National Guard and 60 police officers, armed with loaded shotguns and automatic rifles, took up positions on a grassy median running along the center of Convention Center Boulevard. The mere presence of the security forces had a calming effect on many refugees, who said they had been shaken by cries for help on some nights from what they took to be victims of rapes and assaults. ''We heard people, men and women screaming,'' said Chantell Jones, 19. ''But no one got up to help because we were scared for our own lives.'' Other refugees found the arrival of the police and military anything but calming. They said they felt that the police, in their attempts to gain control of the convention center, and the National Guard members, had been as menacing and terrifying as the civilians who sporadically fired guns inside and outside the center, often setting off stampedes. ''The police would draw their rifles and guns down on us,'' said Emily Baker, 56. ''They were very afraid of us.'' Ms. Baker said the police also came in one night and ''took two white people out of here'' in what she interpreted as a selective rescue. ''It was our first time seeing the police here,'' she said. It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from the police in a city without electricity and with little phone service. Rapunzel Weaver, 45, a cook, said she had been sobbing for days because she worried that her stay might drag on endlessly. She said she stopped crying after Mr. Compass arrived. ''This is the first we have heard from him,'' she said, ''and I believe him.'' The refugees said they had been told several times since Tuesday, sometimes bypolice officers in squad cars, that buses were on the way to evacuate them. But the buses never came. ''We've been lied to so much,'' said Raymond Whitfield, 51, who works at a coffee processing plant. Soon after the armed troops moved into position, other soldiers began bringing in military meals. Some also pitched tents for what looked like a medical station. And already, some lawyers were circulating through the storm victims, promising to find compensation for them with a class-action lawsuit against city and state officials. Carl Richardson, 45, a truck driver, said he added his name to a list of potential plaintiffs being compiled by a well-dressed man and a woman partner. Mr. Richardson said he was not especially looking for money. ''If I get a little apology, I'll be happy,'' he said. ''I'm a diabetic and I haven't had anything to eat in five days. I've gotten by, with a little orange juice that I scrounged from a co-worker who brought a little food with her.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE REFUGEES Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"WNBC-TV in New York was one of only 11 NBC stations on Thursday night that did not carry an hourlong NBC News ''Dateline'' report about Hurricane Katrina, choosing to stay with the National Football League preseason game between the Giants and New England Patriots. The ''Dateline'' program started at 10 p.m. and would have been broadcast during the third and fourth quarters of the game. Alison Rudnick, a spokeswoman for WNBC, said the station's management felt that the ''Dateline'' program ''was not of a breaking news nature.'' Had ''fires broken out or if the president was speaking,'' the station would have cut into the game, she said. ''We felt it was important to stick to our commitment,'' Ms. Rudnick added. The game is part of a three-year WNBC deal to carry Giants preseason games. WNBC, which is owned by NBC Universal, held a fund-raiser with the Red Cross for hurricane relief on Wednesday from 7 to 8 p.m., which raised $8.2 million."
"Hurricane Rita attained the strongest storm designation on Wednesday as it barreled toward the Texas coastline, forcing the evacuation of as many as a million people from this island city and other Gulf Coast communities along an arc from Corpus Christi to New Orleans. Heeding the lessons of Hurricane Katrina, the authorities in Galveston ordered all residents to leave the city immediately and tried to evacuate the city's hospitals and nursing homes with buses, ambulances and helicopters. Businesses and public buildings covered windows with plywood, and the Strand, the central business district, was virtually empty by Wednesday afternoon. ''Coastal Texans should not wait until late Thursday or early Friday to leave,'' Gov. Rick Perry said. ''Homes and businesses can be rebuilt. Lives cannot.'' Over little more than 24 hours, Hurricane Rita strengthened into a Category 5 storm as it cleared the Florida Keys and passed over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Rita had winds near 175 miles per hour, putting it at the highest measurable level. Hurricane Katrina had briefly reached Category 5 strength as it approached the Gulf Coast, but it weakened a notch before slamming into Louisiana and Mississippi on Aug. 29. The death toll from that storm passed the 1,000 mark on Wednesday. [Page A28.] Forecasters say Hurricane Rita will pass over cooler waters on Thursday and Friday, potentially weakening it to a Category 4 storm before it makes landfall, which is predicted early Saturday north of Matagorda Bay. Winds of 130 m.p.h. in parts of Texas should be expected, said Bob Rose, a meteorologist with the Lower Colorado River Authority in Texas. ''This is going to be one very nasty, mean hurricane when it strikes land,'' Mr. Rose said. The approaching storm provoked fear in Houston and along a broad swath of the Texas coast, where a nuclear plant and huge petrochemical refineries pose special hazards. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that operators of the nuclear plant the South Texas Project in Bay City, a few miles from Matagorda Bay, were working to shut down both of its reactors. Officials of the state's environmental agency, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said Wednesday that they were receiving numerous reports from plant operators along the length of the coast that they were shutting down their industrial processes or minimizing operations as a precaution. ''In the wake of Katrina, people are being more vigilant and more conservative in their approach,'' especially in light of that hurricane's economic and environmental impacts resulting from damage at similar facilities in Louisiana, said David Bower, the assistant director for field operations of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Mr. Bower described the shutdowns and other actions as ''absolutely comprehensive'' at locations along the Texas coast. The possibility of the storm hitting anywhere on the Texas coastline drove oil prices higher on concern that the storm might shut down refineries or tear apart pipelines. Companies evacuated workers from at least three refineries around Houston, which has the nation's highest concentration of refining capacity. Oil prices climbed 60 cents, or 1 percent, to $66.80 a barrel. In Washington, where President Bush declared a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana, officials tried to show that they were prepared for Hurricane Rita after the government's missteps in responding to Hurricane Katrina. ''I urge the citizens to listen carefully to the instructions provided by state and local authorities and follow them,'' President Bush said in a speech Wednesday to the Republican Jewish Coalition. ''We hope and pray that Hurricane Rita will not be a devastating storm, but we got to be ready for the worst.'' Many of the 13,000 active-duty troops in Louisiana, Mississippi and off the Gulf Coast, including marines and elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, were on standby Wednesday, to deploy to Texas if state officials there requested federal military assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita, officials at the Pentagon said. Ten Navy ships, including the hospital ship Comfort, have moved to the northeastern part of the gulf to avoid the storm, but would be ready to steam in quickly behind the hurricane to offer relief. Twenty helicopters at Fort Hood, Tex., have also been placed on standby in case they are needed for search and rescue, transport or Medivac missions in support of FEMA, said Michael Kucharek, a spokesman for the Northern Command. About 25,000 members of the National Guard are on duty in Louisiana and 10,500 in Mississippi. According to the National Guard Bureau, nearly 2,000 National Guards troops are on state-active duty preparing for Hurricane Rita, and Governor Perry has authorized the activation of up to 5,000 of the more than 10,000 National Guard troops currently available in the state. The Air National Guard has also moved several of its aircraft to Austin from Houston as a precaution. The American Red Cross was moving supplies and equipment into staging areas in Dallas and San Antonio and opening shelters according to Texas's disaster preparedness plans. Its Disaster Operations Center in Washington was a beehive of activity, as its staff and volunteers mustered supplies, vehicles and other necessities. In Florida, Hurricane Rita caused no major structural damage in Key West, but some flooding was reported. About 7,000 customers in the Florida Keys lost power and crews were working to restore it by the end of the day Wednesday. Residents who evacuated Key West were being allowed back Wednesday, while tourists were scheduled to return Friday. Meanwhile in New Orleans, Mayor C. Ray Nagin had a mandatory evacuation order in effect Wednesday for the most of the city, including the French Quarter, the central business district and Uptown. But on Wednesday, the city remained filled with contractors, cleaners and military personnel driving down streets without working traffic lights. The mayor said Tuesday that as many as 500 buses were ready to evacuate the few thousand citizens who may remain. About two dozen people who were evacuating because of Hurricane Rita arrived Wednesday at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, where tens of thousands of people were stranded for days after Hurricane Katrina. On Wednesday, each person was welcomed by six military troops who offered water and ready-to-eat meals. Then they were checked for weapons, asked whether they needed medical assistance and put on a bus, idling with air-conditioning and television until it was full enough to depart, either to Baton Rouge or elsewhere. Several people said they were evacuating for a second time, some after returning to find their homes damaged and without power. Still, after days of worry that Hurricane Rita would strike New Orleans, there was some sense of relief that it was heading west, reducing the potential damage to the city. ''We're watching Rita,'' said Sally Forman, a spokeswoman for the mayor. ''We don't have a huge population in our city, but I think that the mandatory evacuation is working.'' While New Orleans braced for the possibility more disruption, communities in Texas were also on edge Wednesday. South of Galveston in Matagorda County, Sheriff James Mitchell said that his office would not respond to calls in evacuated areas and that parents would be subject to criminal charges for endangerment of a child if they did not remove their children from the path of the storm. Longtime residents in Houston remembered the ravages of the last hurricane to strike the city, Hurricane Alicia, in August 1983. Although barely a Category 3 storm, it was responsible for six deaths and devastated the downtown skyline with 80 m.p.h. winds, shattering hundreds of windows and leaving the streets ankle-deep in glass. Throughout Wednesday, emergency measures were widely and hurriedly put into effect in Houston and along the coast. Schools, colleges, museums and other public institutions announced shutdowns starting Thursday. Prison inmates, hospital patients, nursing home residents and other vulnerable populations were evacuated from low-lying areas, and stores were stripped of bottled water, batteries and other emergency supplies. Long lines formed at banks, some of which restricted withdrawals to $500 at a time. Galveston was perhaps more nervous than any other city, having just marked the 105th anniversary of the great storm of 1900, which killed more than 6,000 residents and remains the deadliest natural disaster in the nation's history. Although Galveston largely rebuilt itself and raised the elevation of parts of the island, the storm contributed to the city's decline from a bustling center for shipping and finance to a somewhat sleepy tourist destination. ''This one could be bigger than 1900, which was just a Category 3,'' said Tom Weaver, 60, as workers boarded windows of his business, Scratch and Dent Furniture. ''If it hits us, mark my words, there will be looting. There's two types of people in this world, those that work and those that steal from those that work.'' Most of Galveston was eerily empty by early Wednesday evening, with even a team of nine officials from the Federal Emergency Management Administration leaving the city. The FEMA officials, who had been assisting evacuees from Louisiana, said they had been ordered by their managers to leave Galveston. At the University of Texas Medical Branch, a complex consisting of six hospitals, 320 of its 370 patients had been evacuated by early Wednesday evening, Marsha Canright, a spokeswoman, said. The state corrections department Wednesday also evacuated another 70 inmates from the medical center's prison hospital, Ms. Canright said. She said it was the first time in the hospital's 114-year history that it had been evacuated. In a span of four hours Wednesday morning, the 175 residents of Edgewater Retirement Community, which sits along the city's seawall, were evacuated on chartered buses and ambulances, said Barbara Williams, the residence's assistant administrator. ''This is not something that is a reactionary thing to Katrina,'' Ms. Williams said. ''We just simply have always had a plan for evacuation for a hurricane.'' Some people in Galveston said they had no idea when they might be able to return to the city, which has 60,000 residents. Saúl Aucancela, the owner of a market selling products from Mexico, said he was planning to drive to Reynosa, a border city in northern Mexico some eight hours to the south, to escape the storm. ''I'm placing my fate in God's hands,'' Mr. Aucancela, 55, said in Spanish as he finished nailing plywood on the wall of his store to protect his windows. His 18 employees had already left Galveston for refuge inland. ''I want to go to a place that isn't too expensive if I have to stay there a while,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"Energy companies stepped up evacuations of offshore operations and rushed to secure refineries on the Texas coast yesterday as they prepared for Hurricane Rita, which was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane packing winds up to 165 miles an hour. The storm appeared to be headed for the heart of the nation's oil industry. With traders uncertain where the full fury of the hurricane might fall, oil prices moved higher but closed below their peaks for the day. The stock market also took a blow yesterday, with the Dow industrials falling more than 100 points, to 10,378.03, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined by 0.91 percent, to 1,210.20. After being hit hard by Hurricane Katrina just three weeks ago, the energy industry could face a far greater test if Hurricane Rita causes extensive damage and shutdowns along the Texas coast. How much worse the situation could be, industry experts said, will depend on exactly where the hurricane makes landfall, how strong it is when it does, and how quickly electricity, telephones and other basic services can be restored. The storm could also have serious economic and environmental consequences for chemical manufacturers on the Texas coast. More than 160 plants in Texas are in the potential path of the storm, according to the American Chemistry Council. Roughly half the nation's chemical-production capacity is in the region. Texas is home to 26 refineries, representing more than a quarter of the nation's crude oil processing capacity. Of those refineries, 17 are in cities along the coast. By comparison, Katrina initially disabled about 10 refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi, accounting for 10 percent of the nation's capacity. Roughly half of that output remains out of service. BP and Royal Dutch Shell said they were shutting refineries that together process 770,000 barrels of oil a day, or 4.5 percent of domestic capacity. And Exxon Mobil said it was moving nonessential employees further inland from its Baytown plant, which processes 557,000 barrels a day. ''The potential impact is much more serious,'' said Kenneth M. Stern, a managing director at FTI Consulting in New York. ''We all sort of hope that Rita is not as strong as Katrina, but if you put them on an equal basis you are talking about nearly three times the amount of refining capacity that is at risk.'' Crude oil for November delivery finished up 60 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $66.80 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. October gasoline futures ended up 7.65 cents, or 3.9 percent, at $2.0531 a gallon. The National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane Rita was expected to land as at least a Category 3 storm on the Texas coast between the Mexican border and western Louisiana by the weekend. Officials in Galveston, the island city 50 miles southeast of Houston, ordered a mandatory evacuation. ''The farther south it hits, the better it is as far as petroleum and gasoline are concerned,'' said Robert S. Linden, a managing consultant of the PA Consulting Group in Washington. Like Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita's biggest impact on the energy sector will probably be felt at refineries, the industrial workhorses that boil and pressurize crude oil in dangerous conditions to produce gasoline, diesel and other fuels. The nation's refineries have been running at or near capacity all year. After Katrina disrupted refineries and pipelines that deliver Gulf Coast fuel to the eastern half of the country, retail gasoline prices soared past $3 a gallon in many cities, a situation that could recur after Rita. Yesterday, the national average retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was $2.764, down slightly from $2.788 but still higher than the $2.613 a month ago and $1.859 a year ago, according to AAA. One fuel distributor in Atlanta said wholesale prices were holding steady for now, but retailers and large commercial customers appeared to be ordering larger supplies for delivery in the coming days in anticipation of shortages. ''We are seeing a huge amount of demand in terms of people trying to top off their retail outlets and their terminals and tanks,'' the distributor, Tex Pitfield, president and chief executive of Saraguay Petroleum, said. ''The product is readily available for the most part, but nobody has the trucks.'' Analysts say that even if Hurricane Rita does not devastate refineries, their shutdown will make tight supplies even scarcer. ''Even if you restart on Sunday, it's going to be two, three or four days before they are fully operational,'' said Thomas Bentz, an analyst at BNP Paribas. ''Can we afford to have that much supply out of the market? It doesn't seem that we can.'' Soaring retail gasoline prices after Hurricane Katrina led to numerous calls for investigations into allegations of price gouging. The Federal Trade Commission has started an investigation, as required under a energy law adopted this year. ''I don't know we have seen any evidence of manipulation,'' John H. Seesel, an associate general counsel for the commission, said in a telephone interview. ''But that's what the investigation is meant to find out.'' Whether Hurricane Rita leads to the kinds of price spikes and spot shortages seen earlier this month could depend greatly on consumers. After falling for the first two weeks after Hurricane Katrina, demand for gasoline rose 2.1 percent in the week that ended Sept. 16, according to the Energy Information Administration. In one encouraging sign, gasoline inventories rose 1.8 percent, to 195.4 million barrels, slightly above where they were before Katrina struck, indicating that imports and domestic refineries have been able to make up some of the lost production. As for offshore facilities, energy companies shut 73.1 percent of oil production yesterday, up from 58.5 percent on Tuesday, and 47.13 percent of natural gas production, up from 34.8 percent, according to the Interior Department. The companies also evacuated more than half of their platforms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Those numbers will rise as energy companies move workers off platforms and rigs in phases, evacuating those farthest east and closest to the storm first before moving to platforms closer to shore."
"Up North Claiborne Avenue five dogs ran as a pack between the smashed houses under dead power lines, through that twisted junkscape of lumber and tin, toilets in the silt, a wall marked ''Possible Body'' and the headless Virgin Mary with arms outstretched. The dogs neither fought nor growled. Among their number were a German shepherd, a beagle and a yellow Labrador. They roam this city gaunt and uncomprehending, at turns frightened and menacing, loping directionless between ruined buildings, drinking the muck, staring at cars, waiting to die. They are omnipresent. A week ago, their self-appointed rescuers spoke of the odds of rejoining them as pets to masters, but that talk has ended. Now these dogs make for an infestation, untold thousands unwell, unrestrained, unrecognizable and left to their devices. ''I'm afraid that they'll be out here for years,'' said Wendy Guidry, among those who spend their days trying to corral the creatures. ''That there'll be a long-term population of dogs that will never be caught, that will live on the streets for years and eventually be hit by cars. That will be their lives.'' The dogs do not lack for sympathy or attendants. From the first days after Hurricane Katrina laid waste to this city, images of pets that were left behind despite protestations drew crowds of rescue volunteers. Money was gathered and airlifts were chartered. Among the crowded flights bound for New Orleans when Louis Armstrong Airport reopened last week, on planes full of cowboy contractors and corporate fixers, the earnest came to save the dogs. On a connection out of Atlanta, Crystal Smith made the first flight of her life to come join the Humane Society here. She was afraid of the dogs she would find. ''They're becoming vicious,'' Ms. Smith said. ''But it's not because they're hungry and they want to eat people. They're scared. They're stressed out; they've been living on the roof. And they don't know what you're here for.'' More than 400 rescuers are based at the Lamar-Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales, La., 60 miles away, said Julie Morris, director of national outreach for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. With credentials from New Orleans, they enter the city to chase animals, and they have captured about 7,000. How many remain no one knows. Based on human demographics, the American Veterinary Medical Association has estimated that 50,000 to 70,000 dogs were kept as pets in New Orleans. ''There's nobody who knows how many people successfully evacuated with their animals,'' Ms. Morris said. That leaves pets abandoned in the evacuation of the city, the feral population and the pit bulls trained to fight for sport, a significant pastime here before the storm. Rescuers on the streets said the bigger dogs were dying first. ''We were seeing dogs eating dead dogs,'' Ms. Guidry said. Those removed from the city are increasingly diseased. Sixty have been euthanized in Gonzales. ''The longer it goes on, the worse that's going to get,'' Ms. Morris said. On the streets, though, the dogs are learning to survive. Rescuers, soldiers and journalists leave the dogs food, and sometimes the food is gone when the people return. Rescuers have found dogs cowering in houses, but many dogs, called runners, remain on the streets. A few blocks away in the Ninth Ward, where packs gather by a breached levee, three German shepherds patrolled a smashed wooden rooftop in the tall grass. When two men approached, the dogs ran to the near edge of the tar-black rooftop four feet from the ground. They raised their heads and craned their necks and barked hoarsely into the quiet. The men poured crackers onto the street outside the twisted fence, and two of the dogs barked. The third returned to the high point of the roof, where it could see the broken levee, and laid its head on the tar. STORM AND CRISIS: ANIMALS"
"Eloise Juneau does not need a calendar to tell how long she has been living in a shelter. Any mirror does just fine. Her blond hair has turned silvery at the roots, a reminder that it has been almost four weeks since she has been able to dye it. Still, over that time she and her boyfriend have gone from sleeping on the bare floor of the Civic Center in Houma, about an hour southwest of New Orleans, to building a makeshift bedroom complete with queen-size mattress, lounge chairs and a place to hang their clothes. The couple, both 65, call it The Hilton. At the other end of the state, the floor of the Hirsch Memorial Coliseum on the Louisiana State Fairgrounds in Shreveport is a grid of mattresses and family encampments, alive with the flicker of donated televisions and the sounds of scampering children. The walkways between the beds have been marked off with white tape, and each path has been named for a street in New Orleans -- Bourbon, Canal, Hope -- so people have an address to describe where they sleep. The initial, numbing shock of seeing the world upended has begun to subside for many evacuees, according to interviews in 16 shelters over the last week across the length and breadth of Louisiana. Instead, as the days turn into weeks and approach a month, a kind of normalcy has begun to creep in, a new life requiring novel strategies and fresh uncertainties. Children are in school. Bank accounts have been opened. Sleep spaces on coliseum floors have moved from habitats to homes. The daily schedule of church visits, hot meals, mail calls and A.A. meetings has become as familiar as old neighborhood routines. And for many of the evacuees, who expected to be in shelters for only a few days, those routines have led to a creeping sense of dread that they will not get out of the shelters for weeks, perhaps months. What was supposed to be a transitory phase in their lives is beginning to take on an awful feeling of permanency. ''Things are moving so much quicker at the shelters in Texas,'' said Deirdre Cheavious, 32, who is staying at the Health and Physical Education Building at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches. ''Here, it's like a turtle.'' Her boyfriend, Mike Williams, 41, shook his head ruefully. ''Welcome to Louisiana,'' he said. Federal emergency officials said this week that there were still 71,280 evacuees from Hurricane Katrina in more than 650 shelters scattered across the nation. More than 40 percent of them, or 30,650, were in the 317 shelters still operating in Louisiana. There has been a steady trickle of evacuees moving out of the shelters over the last two weeks, some into hotels, others into housing that they have found, either on their own or with the help of church groups and others. The trickle might have become a surge, relief officials said, if not for the scarcity of available housing in the state. For the most part, food and daily necessities are plentiful, but promised money from the federal government and the Red Cross has been maddeningly slow to arrive. Almost everywhere, the greatest need is for places to live -- apartments, houses, mobile homes, anything to get out of the shelters. And now, state officials say, they will be moving thousands from shelters south of Interstate 10 to shelters in the northern part of the state, just to be safe as Hurricane Rita plows through the Gulf of Mexico. So -- just as it did in the hours when Hurricane Katrina pounded their city -- fate continues to roll through the lives of these evacuees at a Category 5 clip. At almost every turn, some combination of chance, luck and split-second decisions continues to determine the future of the storm's families. ''After we got rescued by the men in the boats, we just got on the first bus,'' said Veronica Causey, 44. ''We didn't know where it was going.'' It was going to Shreveport. And after two weeks on a pair of mattresses on the floor of the Hirsch Coliseum, Ms. Causey and her two sons were packing up to move into a three-bedroom house found for them by a local church group. Shreveport, they have decided, is their new home. ''We're going to start over,'' she said. ''I can do ironing, mend clothes, do some cooking. I need to find a new church. I live in Shreveport now.'' Margaret Trotter came to the shelter in Natchitoches because her daughter was beginning college there. But her husband fled New Orleans by air and ended up in Atlanta, and another daughter caught a bus at the Superdome and is living in Houston. ''It all depended on how you got out and which bus you got on,'' she said. A few days ago, two empty buses showed up at the Shreveport shelter from Lincoln, Neb. After a pep talk from church leaders who came with the buses, all about the joys of life on the Great Plains, a few dozen people collected their belongings, clambered aboard and headed north. They are Cornhuskers now. A day or two earlier, two busloads left the Rapides Coliseum in Alexandria, La., for new lives and jobs in Indianapolis, increasing the world's supply of Hoosiers by about three dozen. ''We had a bus take people up to Kentucky and Ohio,'' said Clyde Davis, manager of the sprawling shelter in the Lake Charles Civic Center, where nearly 2,000 people are spread across three levels. ''And there were 19 people who left on a bus this morning. I forget where they're headed.'' Those who remain in the system have to deal with shelters that vary widely in quality. Some run more smoothly than others, and their mood is often set by the personalities of the Red Cross volunteers or church leaders running them. Some shelters feature regular live music, computer rooms and big-screen televisions. Others do without mattresses and even the most basic comforts of life. Evacuees in Abita Springs, a small town on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, live in a dank school gymnasium where the power fails regularly and the only working shower is a garden hose suspended from the top of a schoolhouse door. The temporary residents scrub their laundry on a concrete slab or wash their clothes by hand in buckets, laying them to dry over the top of a chain-link fence. ''It's rough, it really is,'' said Joyce Bird Manguno, 74. ''And it's monotonous. You have nothing to do. You wash your clothes over and over, because there's nothing else to do.'' These smaller ones are known as popcorn shelters -- ''Because they pop up here and there,'' Mr. Davis explained -- and the authorities are eager to close them gradually and consolidate the remaining evacuees in one of the larger sites. ''But it can be hard to get people out of the popcorns,'' Mr. Davis said. Already, the number of evacuees has dwindled, as people gradually move out of the shelters and into local housing or head out of state. At the shelter in the Abita Springs Middle School, there were about 300 people just after the storm hit. But a few days ago, only 15 remained. And in Lake Charles, at one of the state's largest shelters, there were 3,300 evacuees at the height, but only 1,972 by early this week. ''We don't like to call them evacuees,'' said Cathy Little, who quit her job as a hairdresser to become the de facto floor manager at the Shreveport shelter. ''We call them guests.'' It is Ms. Little who gets on the loudspeaker every morning to rouse her guests -- ''Mommas, it's time to wake up your babies,'' she calls out -- and she spends her day patrolling the grid of human nests. ''The question is, How do you get out of the shelter?'' asked Mr. Williams, who worked at an air-conditioning company in New Orleans and is getting pretty sick of the same four walls of the shelter in Natchitoches. ''The trick is to be in the right place at the right time, but how do you do that?'' There are always rumors about where apartments can be found, and a steady stream of people offering accommodations -- and sometimes jobs -- in places far away. But the reality is a daily struggle to find a dwindling number of places. ''You're pretty much left on your own to figure it out,'' said Arie Floys, 23, at a shelter in Alexandria. ''I find, as soon as I give the landlords my cellphone number, which has a New Orleans area code, they say nothing's available. I think they're afraid we'll just stay a little while and then take off back for New Orleans.'' Church groups also show up at the shelters to offer help and housing, and there are dozens of success stories. But some residents said they suspected that the religious groups tended to gravitate to those who shared their faith. ''If you aren't religious, they don't want to talk to you,'' Mr. Williams said. And there are some who say they will be sad to leave the shelter -- reluctant to lose a second neighborhood in less than a month. Jeanette Houston, living in a small shelter at a school in Hahnville, just west of New Orleans, said she was depressed when she first got there. But after a few weeks, she says she has a network of friends that almost rivals what she left behind in New Orleans. ''I got to meet a lot of good people just sitting here talking,'' said Ms. Houston, who worked in a nursery. ''I sit here in this gym watching the kids run around, and it's like being in front of my door.'' In the meantime, fate keeps asserting itself. ''I got this lady who says she'll fly me to Indiana and give me a place to live and a job,'' said Larry Fleming, 27. ''But I also have a bid out on an apartment here in Alexandria.'' He has decided to let chance decide. If he gets the apartment, he will stay in Alexandria. If not, he will hop on a plane to Indiana. Frankly, he said, it could go either way. ''You know, last Christmas we had snow in New Orleans,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''And we never ever have snow in New Orleans, so it was really weird. ''But this storm? Man, this storm has been scarier than Christmas.'' STORM AND CRISIS: SHELTERS"
"You may think of jazz when you think of New Orleans. Or maybe the blues, or zydeco. But hip-hop, too, has become such a part of the city's culture that Loren Fourous was able to make a living from it, as the founder and president of a glossy quarterly called Da R.U.D.E. Magazine. After Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Fourous, 38, took shelter in a friend's home in Houston. Yesterday, she moved to a hotel as Hurricane Rita headed toward Texas. ''It's so traumatic,'' she said over the phone. ''The whole thing feels like Hurricane Katrina again.'' The magazine, which she ran from her apartment in New Orleans with a cluster of computers, printers and scanners, is in tatters. Its archives and all her personal possessions -- including family photos and her favorite Gucci and Baby Phat frocks -- are gone. Ms. Fourous wants to re-establish Da R.U.D.E. (the initials, pronounced like the word they spell, stand for Raw Uncensored Dope Entertainment) in Houston, which also has a vibrant hip-hop scene. But she has no savings, she said, and her appeals for help from the music industry have gone unanswered. ''I've sent out e-mails to well over 20 or 30 of the major labels,'' she said, ''and I haven't heard back from any of them. I've had their artists on my cover. I've given them free advertising. That's why I thought during my time of need they would help me.'' One publicist, Jackie O. Asare of Manhattan, reached out to Ms. Fourous by e-mail. ''I said, 'I know you're struggling right now, what can I do?''' Ms. Asare said. Ms. Fourous, who estimates she would need $25,000 to get her 72-page magazine going again, knew she was not dealing with deep pockets. So she countered with a modest request: send cosmetics. Ms. Asare said she shipped $100 worth of shampoos and moisturizers. Another publicist, Echo Hattix of Los Angeles, arranged for a clothing manufacturer to send khakis, T-shirts and tank tops. Ms. Fourous had to postpone the wedding she had planned for Oct. 15, and last weekend she and her fiancé, a paramedic working in New Orleans, broke up. ''The hurricane placed a major strain on the relationship,'' she said. After a lifetime in New Orleans, Ms. Fourous says she feels disoriented in Houston. ''I'm completely displaced in a city where I don't know anyone,'' she said. ''It's mentally distressing. I have my good days and I have my very, very emotional days, when it's like a surreal type of thing.'' JOSEPH B. TREASTER STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"Catching a bus at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center to evacuate for Hurricane Rita is a breeze. Six soldiers greet each evacuee who trickles into the processing tent across the street. Those arriving have food, water, medical assistance if they need it and, once they board one of the buses idling in the parking lot, air-conditioning and television. No one has to fight for a seat. ''We sent a couple of buses out yesterday with only one person on it,'' said Sgt. Tim Hohrman, a National Guardsman from Oklahoma manning the tent on Wednesday. Here at the convention center, thousands of residents, mostly black and poor, had sought shelter and escape from Hurricane Katrina three weeks ago and waited days for buses to come and evacuate them. On Wednesday, a strikingly efficient evacuation operation was under way in a city with nearly no one left to evacuate. ''Well,'' said Lt. General Russel H. Honoré, the head of the military response to the storm, ''We're ready.'' He recalled how the military, once in place, helped 20,000 people evacuate the center in nine hours. On Wednesday, only about two dozen people were evacuated from the center, following about 30 people the day before. For some, it was their second evacuation. Others were rescue volunteers who needed a ride out of town. Richard Brown, who had been airlifted to safety from Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters, slept in an airport terminal and was flown to San Antonio, returned to New Orleans on Monday only to find his house in this city's Carrollton section unlivable and a new evacuation order in effect. Mr. Brown said he walked most of the miles from his house to the convention center. He said he did not care where he was going. ''I'm being obedient to the mayor,'' Mr. Brown said. ''What else am I going to do?'' Patrick Rafferty, his wife, Cheryl, and their son Patrick were also leaving after having come from Arkansas to help a local church, Riverside Baptist, serve meals to whoever needed them. ''We don't have a vehicle,'' Mr. Rafferty said, gesturing toward the bus parking lot. ''That's the way out.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE CONVENTION CENTER"
"The death toll from Hurricane Katrina passed 1,000 on Wednesday, with Louisiana reporting 799 fatalities and Mississippi 219. But the seeming precision of the numbers raises the question of which deaths can truly be attributed to the storm. As many as 100 of the deaths in Louisiana could be ascribed to natural causes, coroners around the state said in interviews. Coroners from parish to parish were using different criteria to sort out who died because of the storm and who did not, distinctions critical to understanding the scale of the storm and to more immediate concerns like insurance and funeral coverage. In East Baton Rouge Parish, miles from the destruction, for example, the State Department of Health and Hospitals reported 68 deaths from the hurricane. But Don Morrow, the chief of operations for the parish coroner, said he did not consider the majority of those deaths to be storm-related. Rather, he said, the number reflected evacuees who died in the parish since the storm, including a young man shot to death at an apartment complex in Baton Rouge. One woman died of sepsis, an infection from dirty water, and another died after hitting her head and waiting two days for medical care, Mr. Morrow said. But most of the dead were either elderly and had carcinoma, heart disease or other illnesses, or were premature babies, he said, adding, ''I'm hesitant to count those as storm-related deaths.'' The state has said that any death that would not have occurred were it not for the hurricane should be counted. Robert Johannessen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Hospitals, said the numbers were preliminary and would ultimately be revised to exclude deaths unrelated to the storm. But many experts said it was not always easy to make that call, and in the case of this storm many bodies would never be autopsied, in part because they were too decomposed. An evacuation or the storm itself could contribute to a death or hasten it, but in many cases it is impossible to know if the person would have died anyway. ''That's a 1-800-GOD question,'' Mr. Morrow said. Frank Lepore, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center, acknowledged that criteria for attributing a death to a storm were not uniform from state to state or county to county. ''Deaths and dollars are notoriously slippery numbers,'' Mr. Lepore said, adding that the hurricane center gets its fatality figures from news reports. The number of deaths attributed to Hurricane Katrina by Wednesday was 1,036, including 14 in Florida, 2 in Georgia and 2 in Alabama. In Florida, a state experienced in dealing with hurricanes, medical examiners group hurricane-related deaths into two categories: direct and indirect, said Stephen J. Nelson, the chairman of the state Medical Examiners Commission. Drownings and deaths caused by falling trees or flying debris are considered direct. Carbon monoxide poisoning from an improperly ventilated generator, a heart attack brought on while cleaning up debris, or an accident with a chainsaw would be considered indirect. ''If they are evacuated because of the storm, and they die because of a pre-existing condition, we would count that as an indirect death,'' Dr. Nelson said. He recalled one incident where a man was evacuated to a hotel, slipped in the shower and died. The death was classified as indirectly related to the storm. ''Had it not been for the hurricane, he would not have been there,'' Dr. Nelson said. Even suicides and homicides are classified as indirect if they can be connected to the storm, he said. But he acknowledged that especially with the sick and elderly, it was difficult to determine how much a storm contributed to the death. ''There is a gray area,'' he said. Dr. Nelson said one implication of the determination is that the Federal Emergency Management Agency pays for storm-related funerals. In Florida in recent years, that practice has caused some controversy, with medical examiners complaining that FEMA paid for AIDS, cancer and other unrelated deaths, requiring very little proof. In St. Tammany Parish, there were six deaths directly related to the storm -- five from drowning and one from a falling tree, said the coroner, Peter R. Galvan. A seventh person, a 14-year-old boy, died while using a chainsaw after the storm. But Dr. Galvan said there were about 50 deaths, as yet unreported to the state, which may have been indirectly caused by the storm, including evacuees who died of natural causes, or those who could not get insulin or other medical treatments because of the storm. ''There is a lot of room for judgment,'' he said. ''Even normally, there's a lot of room for medical judgment on these death certificates.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE DEAD"
"House Republicans plan to proceed with a special investigation into the government response to Hurricane Katrina despite resistance by Democrats who say they will not take part and are demanding an independent inquiry. ''We have to move ahead while some of the evidence is still fresh,'' said Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the select Hurricane Katrina panel that the House approved last week. Mr. Davis said Wednesday that the committee was scheduled to hear from hurricane experts on Thursday and that he has summoned Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration who resigned under fire last week, to testify on Tuesday. ''I would hope they would not pass up the opportunity to cross-examine Michael Brown on the stand,'' said Mr. Davis, who added that he would invite Democrats from the Gulf Coast to participate in the hearing next week if party leaders did not appoint members of the special panel. The House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said Wednesday that she was not backing down. ''I will not appoint any Democrats to participate in this sham,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who has the authority to recommend 9 of the 20 panel members. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois named 10 Republicans to join Mr. Davis on the panel, including the chairmen of the Judiciary and Veterans' Affairs Committees. While maneuvering over the inquiry continued, the House approved more than $6billion in tax breaks for individuals and businesses affected by the storm even as a coalition of House conservatives suggested more than $500billion in spending cuts over 10 years to offset the cost of the recovery effort. The Senate is widely expected to act quickly on the tax plan, which among other provisions would waive penalties on withdrawals from retirement funds by storm victims and grant a special $500 tax exemption to people who take in evacuees who are not family members. ''I look forward to the president's quickly signing this bill, so that Gulf Coast citizens can begin to rebuild their lives without the concern of how they will pay their taxes,'' said Representative Jim McCrery, a Louisiana Republican who is a senior member of the House tax-writing committee. Conservative members of the House Republican Study Committee announced their $500billion in recommended cuts over 10 years. ''It's time for us to realize that the tax dollars we spend are real,'' said Representative Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia. Many proposals, like eliminating support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, have been perennial goals of Republicans, and the leaders of the effort to identify cuts acknowledged that they did not agree among themselves on what should go. Mr. Hastert said the leadership was willing to consider ideas from the rank and file, but he ruled out delaying the new Medicare prescription drug plan or dropping projects from the highway bill. ''We will look at viable offsets if it is something that we can get passed,'' Mr. Hastert said. Democrats quickly criticized the House conservatives' effort, saying it would fall hardest on important federal programs for the poor. ''The Republicans are suggesting that we address the poverty exposed by Katrina by starving and scrimping on education, housing, health and food programs for families across America,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. On the storm inquiry, the two sides are taking gambles. Democrats say they believe that the vivid picture of an inquiry conducted solely by Republicans will help build their case that an outside investigation similar to the 9/11 panel is needed to deliver a credible result. ''We want an independent commission,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, a Democrat with extensive experience in conducting oversight hearings. Republicans say they think that Democrats will appear to be playing politics by not participating in the hearings, which Mr. Davis said would take a thorough look at the failures in the government effort. ''We are not working with any partisan agenda,'' he said. ''We are working for the American people on this.'' He added that the public would be the ultimate judge of how the inquiry is conducted. ''This is not some partisan cover-up,'' Mr. Davis said. ''This is something that we want the questions asked.'' He said he expected members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to participate in some hearings with the House. Senate leaders negotiated on Wednesday their differences on proceeding with an inquiry, though the panel has held some sessions. STORM AND CRISIS: CONGRESS"
"Along with ruined homes and upended trees, the recent hurricanes left behind a revived debate about global warming. While some environmentalists point to the wreckage as a kind of retribution for America's failure to control greenhouse gas emissions, right-wing talk show hosts repeat, over and over, that even if global warming did exist, there is no proof it had anything to do with Rita and Katrina. In a way, they're all right. It is impossible to link Katrina or Rita, or any particular hurricane, specifically to global warming. This does not mean that President Bush and the rest of us should not be connecting the dots. These are natural disasters -- but with human fingerprints. Hurricanes derive their strength from warm ocean waters. Ocean temperatures have been rising over the last 100 years, along with atmospheric temperatures. Hurricanes have therefore become bigger and more destructive and are likely to grow even more violent in the future. This cycle cannot be reversed any time soon. But one thing humans can do is to reduce their own contribution to global warming by controlling industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The alarm bells have been ringing for a long time, but Katrina and Rita should serve as yet another warning to an administration that has belittled the science of global warming. The emerging hurricane problem is size, not quantity. The scientists who have studied the issue have not detected any increase in the number of hurricanes. Yet these same scientists -- in research reports appearing in reputable journals like Science, Nature and The Journal of Climate -- have detected increases of up to 70 percent in hurricane intensity, a measure that combines the power of a hurricane and its duration. There has been a commensurate increase in damage, mainly because more and more people have stubbornly put themselves at risk by moving to low-lying coastal areas. But the hurricanes' added strength has clearly contributed to the ever-higher toll in lives and property damage. Being cautious folk, the scientists point out that cyclical lulls and surges in hurricane activity may also have something to do with stronger storms. But even if they are completely wrong in linking warming to intensity, which seems unlikely, global warming will have other undesirable consequences, including a significant rise in sea level. In the last century, sea level rose 4 to 8 inches around the world, and most scientists expect a further rise of 2 to 3 feet in this century. According to one government study, a 20-inch rise in sea level by 2100 could put 3,500 square miles of the southern coast of the United States underwater -- rendering efforts to restore the Everglades and the Louisiana coastline essentially pointless. A large-scale breakup of the polar ice sheets would, of course, make matters much worse. Dikes could protect some regions, like Manhattan and the Netherlands, but most coastlines would be inundated. Humanity cannot avoid a warmer Earth and some rise in sea level, largely because of the gases we have already deposited in the atmosphere. But the worst outcomes may be avoided if the world takes concerted action to stabilize industrial emissions of greenhouse gases. This, of course, presupposes aggressive leadership from the United States, which produces more than a quarter of these emissions. But this is a role that Mr. Bush has shown no appetite for at all. Editorial"
"In what officials called Houston's own ''Apollo 13'' brush with disaster, hundreds of thousands of area residents and area oil refineries and chemical plants came within two days of running out of water after Hurricane Rita disrupted power to a pumping plant. A rushed repair -- described as the equivalent of running a giant extension cord to the plant -- restored the flow of water on Tuesday to a municipal reservoir that was down to half its normal 1.5 billion-gallon capacity by midday. The reservoir was being drained at the rate of up to 400 million gallons a day and so would have gone dry by Thursday, Mayor Bill White said at a news briefing at City Hall. How vulnerable the region was to losing its main water supply had been largely overlooked and highlighted a danger that will now become part of future emergency planning, Mr. White said. He said the peril was discovered by chance by Judge Robert Eckels of Harris County, who noted that neighboring Baytown east on Interstate 10 had lost water from the Trinity River pumping station in the wake of the storm on Saturday and thought to ask where else the water went. Houston, it turned out. ''We're all finding this out together,'' said Mayor Calvin Mundinger of Baytown, recounting how Judge Eckels and Paul Bettencourt, the Harris County tax assessor and collector, broke in on a Baytown conference call to disclose the problem. The information set off a frenzied effort to find a repair before the faucets dried up to 600,000 people in the area, half of them in Houston, and 75 petrochemical plants that require 150 million gallons of water a day to produce gasoline and diesel and jet fuel. The plants produce about 15 percent of the nation's fuel. ''Saturday night to Sunday, we had a mini-Apollo 13,'' said Tom Standish, vice president for electrical and gas operations of CenterPoint Energy, which went outside its service area to provide the crucial power to the Trinity River plant's 12 pumps after Entergy lines were devastated. With Houstonians still fuming over the way the emergency evacuation deteriorated into colossal traffic tie-ups, city officials have in recent days been hinting of a redeeming tale of salvation that spared Houston a worse calamity. After some of the water crisis was described by the local ABC affiliate, Channel 13, late Monday, Mayor White announced that while many ''heaved a sigh of relief when we didn't receive hundred-mile-an-hour winds,'' the danger was considerable. And he applauded the people ''who helped us protect ourselves.'' Foremost among them, he said, was Judge Eckels, the highest elected county official, who thought to ask about Houston's source of water after learning of Baytown's problem. Judge Eckels credited Mr. Bettencourt, who has an engineering background, with designing a solution, even as the mayor and judge were on the phone to the Energy Department in Washington. The final plan called for CenterPoint to activate an emergency electrical link to Entergy, the region's service provider, that would send power flowing to the downed Trinity River plant about 40 miles northeast of Houston. The plant pumps water to the Lynchburg Reservoir, a prime water source for the Houston area. Other supplies come from wells, the San Jacinto River and Lakes Houston and Conroe. But the refineries rely exclusively on the Trinity River plant and reservoir. ''Think of it as a huge extension cord,'' said Michael S. Marcotte, director of the Houston Public Works and Engineering Department. STORM AND CRISIS: WATER"
"Edwin P. Compass III, the city's flamboyant police superintendent, resigned on Tuesday after weeks of criticism for his department's failure to stem disorder in the city and in his own department in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. At a news conference in which he took no questions, Mr. Compass noted that he had been a policeman for 26 years and chief for 3 1/2 years, saying, ''I have taken this department through some of the toughest times in its history.'' But, he added, ''Every man in a leadership position must know when it's time to hand over the reins to someone else.'' He gave no reasons for resignation, but it came on the same day that the police department announced that about 250 officers -- about 15 percent of the force -- would be investigated for absences without permission in the days after Hurricane Katrina submerged this city four weeks ago. On Tuesday morning, an editorial in The New Orleans Times-Picayune accused Mr. Compass and Mayor C. Ray Nagin of embellishing stories of mayhem at the convention center and the Superdome in the chaotic days following the hurricane. Warren J. Riley, the deputy superintendent, was named acting superintendent by Mayor Nagin, who called Mr. Compass a ''hero.'' Mr. Compass, 47, has defended his department's reaction to the hurricane, saying the police held the city together even though the department's ammunition armory was left underwater, its communications system had failed and relief from the military was slow in arriving. His supporters praised him for his street cop's sensibility, his honesty and his avoidance of the labyrinth of politics in promoting officers. He had a garrulous, casual, approachable style, preferring to be called Eddie instead of Edwin. ''During the height of the storm, and through the dark times, when we had very little communications from the federal government, the men and women of this department had the wherewithal and the spirit to keep this city together,'' said Lt. David Benelli, president of the city's police union. ''That's due to the spirit of Eddie Compass.'' Mr. Compass referred to himself as a ''warrior'' who was the first to set foot on the battlefield during the post-hurricane bedlam in New Orleans. His unorthodox, back-slapping management style was evident two weeks after the hurricane when he stopped while visiting various police districts for a pedicure, a massage and a haircut. It was, he said, all part of visiting his ''troops.'' But the strain was clearly evident in Mr. Compass's face, and, in a recent interview, he spoke of health problems including a bad back, hemorrhoids and glaucoma. He also said he had seen little lately of his wife, Arlene, who is more than eight months pregnant and had evacuated their home west of New Orleans and moved to Denham Springs, La. Privately, some police officers said that Mr. Compass may have considered resigning even before Hurricane Katrina struck. Earlier this month, while in New York, Mr. Compass sought a book deal detailing his hurricane experience, said two publishing officials who asked not to be identified because a confidentiality agreement had been signed. Several high-ranking police officers said, however, that they did not know what was behind his departure. ''We don't know why, whether it's a personal decision or whether there's anything operating in the background,'' said Capt. Michael Pfeiffer, a top police operations official. Yet, morale was known to be low among many officers, some of whom grumbled privately on Tuesday that they were not receiving overtime pay. CNN also reported new accusations last week of police looting in the wake of the storm, which the department denied. Before the hurricane, a hearing before the City Council had been scheduled for this Thursday to discuss accusations of police roughhousing of blacks who dress as Mardi Gras Indians, said Mary Howell, a local civil rights lawyer and longtime critic of the police department. ''There was a palpable separation between the police department and the community,'' Ms. Howell said. ''It was very clear there were problems of leadership and accountability and discipline.'' On Friday, Mr. Nagin is expected to announce a commission to help advise him on the rebuilding of New Orleans. For weeks, local business leaders have lobbied for a forum to debate the various plans for a new New Orleans that have come to dominate conversation around the city. The commission is expected to consist of 16 community and business leaders, say people briefed about the decision, and will include an equal mix of blacks and whites. Scott Cowen, the president of Tulane University, is one name frequently mentioned as a likely choice for the commission. Meanwhile in Texas, which continues to recover from Hurricane Rita, the Harris County Medical Examiner's office in Houston on Tuesday night put out a list of 31 deaths ''associated with Hurricane Rita'' between Sept. 21 and 26. The victims, 19 women and 11 men and a baby boy, ranged in age from 14 months to 92. At least 19 of the deaths appeared linked to the chaotic evacuation when many of the 2.5 million people who fled the oncoming storm spent 12 hours or more stuck in gridlocked traffic in hundred-degree heat. Seven were listed as dying of hyperthermia. But it was impossible to tell the circumstances of the deaths. STORM AND CRISIS: THE POLICE"
"The federal government, straining to find temporary housing for thousands of evacuees from New Orleans, has generally encountered hospitality in cities and towns in the gulf area. But the reception has been very different in the small parish of St. Helena. Here, 80 miles northwest of New Orleans, white residents have spoken up at public meetings to oppose vehemently the construction of temporary housing for the evacuees, most of whom are black. The tension could complicate tentative plans by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to buy land in the parish for trailer lots. ''The only thing we see about these people on the news is what happened in the Superdome,'' said Philip Devall, 42, a white resident of Greensburg, at a recent meeting of the parish government. ''They're rapists and thugs and murderers. I'm telling you, half of them have criminal records. I've worked all my life to have what I have. I can't lose it, and I can't stand guard 24 hours a day.'' About 2,000 evacuees have been staying with friends and family in the parish since Hurricane Katrina, and police officials here say that crime related to the newcomers has been virtually nonexistent. But many residents say that fear is the driving force behind their opposition. ''I want to know how many sex offenders they're going to move in next to me,'' said Marci Kent, 36, also a white resident of Greensburg, at the meeting. ''And I got daughters, too.'' When one white man expressed concern at the meeting over possibly losing his valuables to lawless evacuees, a black woman turned around and angrily pointed a finger at him. ''We work hard for what we got, too,'' she said. ''But these people need a place to stay.'' FEMA has not formally announced its plans here, having only begun to inquire about the number of evacuees in the parish and the availability of land for trailers, parish officials said. Thomas Wicker, president of the St. Helena Parish Police Jury, as the county commission is known, described the agency's efforts as ''very preliminary.'' Nonetheless, the possibility has already begun to divide neighbors. At a public meeting on Tuesday night, Arise Hitchen, 45, a black resident of Greensburg, said that her family was willing to donate 30 acres of land for the placement of trailers but expressed concern that she might not get the chance because of her neighbors' attitudes. ''Living here, I expected this, but I thought people would eventually give in,'' Ms. Hitchen said. ''It's sad to hear people be this negative. This could easily be us tomorrow.'' Maj. Michael Martin, 48, a member of the local sheriff's department, said he could not believe the racial rift was happening in his town. ''We've always been a close-knit, helpful town,'' he said. ''We always take care of people, and now this.'' Michael Cage, 46, a Hammond resident and a pastor at New Star Church in Greensburg, said he wanted to help the factions find a middle ground. ''People don't know what they're afraid of,'' Mr. Cage said. ''We can work out the differences if we try. I'm not saying everyone from New Orleans is a saint, but all of them ain't one either.'' St. Helena Parish is an agricultural area lined by pine and hardwood forests, its 10,500 residents a somewhat equal mix of 52 percent black and 46 percent white. The median household income here is less than $25,000, and the parish's tax base barely supports essential government services. Its school district consistently ranks low among the already low statewide educational performance. James McIntyre, a spokesman for FEMA, said many cities and towns had opened their doors to housing for the evacuees, but some had expressed reservations about the effect on schools, utilities or law enforcement. In those cases, Mr. McIntyre said, the agency could provide money to ease the impact. He said he had heard unconfirmed reports of resistance based on race, and in those cases the agency would work with the governor's office to deal with the problem. One evacuee from New Orleans now living in the parish said that she felt unwelcome but hoped that the temporary housing would be built because she had no other place to go. ''I just want a place for me and my kids,'' said the evacuee, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid being singled out. ''I'm staying in a house with 13 people, and we got to do something.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE EVACUEES"
"Just a month after Hurricane Katrina smashed Mississippi's casino gambling boats, the state Legislature opened a special session Tuesday devoted to how and whether to salvage an industry that has been central to the economy of the Gulf Coast. Saying that placing such structures on the water is no longer safe, Gov. Haley Barbour instantly generated controversy by proposing that casinos, previously restricted to boats moored along the state's southern coast or the Mississippi River, be allowed to move as much as 1,500 feet inland. The casinos had been built on barges because, under Mississippi law, they had to float to keep them physically separate from nearby communities. Mr. Barbour called the moment an opportunity to rebuild the coast into a world-class destination resort made up of sprawling, state-of-the-art entertainment complexes rather than simply rebuilding what was there. ''In 30 years, when I'm dead and gone, people will look at the south coast and look at what it has become,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''If it has become just another version of what it had been, we will have failed.'' But many of the state's religious leaders, who have opposed casino gambling from the beginning, were trying to seize the moment to shut down the casinos. ''It is unfortunate that with all the human needs in Mississippi right now, the gambling-political complex has chosen this unfortunate time to try to expand its influence,'' said William Perkins, spokesman for the Mississippi Baptist Convention Board. Other proposals made by the governor on Tuesday included a $25 million package of bridge loans for small businesses; a short-term line of credit of up to $500 million to keep state and local governments running until federal relief money arrives; and various bills intended to waive deadlines and limit penalties for those whose lives were uprooted by the storm. But the emergence of gambling as the central issue of the session highlighted how crucial the tax money generated by casinos has become to the economy of Mississippi and other states that have gradually allowed the expansion of the industry over the last two decades. In Mississippi, which has among the nation's lowest tax rates for casinos, 12 percent of gambling revenues go to the government -- 8 percent to the state and 4 percent to the county where the casino is. The casinos were projected to bring in $189 million to state tax coffers in the coming fiscal year, a number that has been steadily and rapidly rising since casinos first became legal here in 1990. The governor teared up twice in his speech, once when praising his wife's efforts to help hurricane victims and again at the end, describing how he would not allow Mississippi to miss this opportunity. ''Let's lead a renaissance for Mississippi,'' he said. Many of the state's religious leaders were unmoved. ''When he was running for governor in 2003, he sat in my office twice and told me he would not expand the gambling industry,'' said Donald E. Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, a conservative social policy organization based in Tupelo. ''His constituency was the money people and the moral people, but he's chosen to split his constituency and side with the money people. Well, they may have the money, but we have the people, we have the votes, and he's going to pay.'' Mr. Barbour, a Republican who was once the national party chairman, said his position was entirely consistent with what he said during his campaign, since all he had promised was to stop the spread of gambling to new Mississippi counties. But Mr. Perkins said: ''Well, it all depends on what you mean by expand. We certainly understood him to mean that the way the casinos were was the way they would remain. What he's talking about here sure sounds like expansion to us.'' When casinos were first legalized in Mississippi, gambling was limited to a few boats that would pick up customers and ferry them offshore to gamble. Then, legislators decided to allow the casinos to operate even if they were permanently moored to the shore, as long as they remained on the water. And last year, the legislature voted to allow the casinos to sink pilings into the sea floor, to more safely secure the structures. But before such construction could be undertaken, Katrina came along and destroyed most of the coast's gambling boats. Under Mr. Barbour's proposal, operators could build casinos as much as 1,500 feet inland, as long as they also had some sort of structure right on the beach like a hotel that linked the casino to the water. Religious leaders, however, said the proposal could eventually lead to casinos overrunning the state until there were slot machines in almost every gas station and saloon, as there are in neighboring Louisiana. ''We keep taking little baby steps toward what we fear is a total takeover of the state by the gambling-political complex,'' Mr. Perkins said. Hearings on the new legislation opened this afternoon, and Representative Bobby Moak, the House Gaming Committee chairman, said he expected the bill might go to the House floor as early as Wednesday. It is then that antigambling advocates intend to try to add amendments aimed at maintaining the status quo, or perhaps even rolling back gambling in the state. ''You have as many proposals out there as you have groups,'' Mr. Moak said. ''The governor says 1,500 feet. Industry folks want it to be more. Religious leaders don't want the casinos to move at all. Frankly, it's a big row over what has come down to a few feet.'' But some religious leaders say they see an opportunity to change the law in a way that might, potentially, end all gambling in the state. One amendment almost certain to be proposed would allow a statewide referendum to end gambling. ''That would be dangerous,'' said Representative Ferr Smith, a Democrat who supports the governor's proposal. ''They could vote the whole thing out.'' If religious groups were trying to rein in gambling, political and business leaders from the stricken coastal region were pleading for passage of new casino legislation. In a front-page editorial on Tuesday, The Sun Herald in Biloxi said, ''If decisive action is not taken by the Legislature this week, then the ruin on the coast will reverberate all the way to the Tennessee state line.'' Some form of casino gambling is all but certain to return to the Mississippi coast. Representative Moak said he still hoped to work out a compromise with the church groups. But Mr. Perkins said: ''I don't think so. We will not compromise on this issue. We will never compromise on a moral issue and, to us, that's what gambling is.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE GAMBLING INDUSTRY"
"It was one of the iconic images from the evacuation of the convention center in New Orleans: a weak and bruised elderly woman being wheeled away from the scene in her wheelchair, clutching the hand of a 5-year-old girl. Like the photo of the firefighters raising the American flag at ground zero after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the image -- reproduced on 1,600 Web sites -- told the story of those who survived. It also pulled on the heartstrings of Twila Carter-Ilgen, and one morning she realized that the elderly woman she was offering coffee while serving breakfast at the Reliant Center in Houston was the very one in that photo. ''I said, 'Oh, my gosh, I saw that picture last week,''' Mrs. Carter-Ilgen said. She had already taken a shine to the woman, Nita LaGarde (who is 89, not 105, as she was identified in the photo caption), and to Ms. LaGarde's longtime neighbor from the Ninth Ward, Earnestine Dangerfield, 60, and Tanisha Belvin, Ms. Dangerfield's 5-year-old granddaughter, who has lived with her all her life. ''Once you meet them, you are taken by them because they are so nice and the little girl is so cute,'' Mrs. Carter-Ilgen said. ''I got really involved in their story.'' Ms. LaGarde had refused to leave New Orleans as Hurricane Katrina approached because she was injured during the last evacuation. The three eventually took refuge on a nearby two-story house, and later the roof, where Ms. Dangerfield tied herself to the others with an orange extension cord to keep them from falling off. ''They were taken to a bridge somewhere, and they were there for two days,'' Mrs. Carter-Ilgen said. ''They have a picture of Nita lying in the back of a truck. It was too pitiful. The looters got them the food and water.'' Mrs. Carter-Ilgen's employer -- she is a personal assistant to a C.E.O. -- will perhaps forgive her for spending a week getting new eyeglasses for the three and child care and school enrollment for Tanisha. She found them a three-bedroom brick house, and raised donations to buy a new car. ''They care so much about each other,'' Mrs. Carter-Ilgen said. ''They are a family. They just want to be together.'' She explained her intense interest in their plight: ''My grandmother lived off by herself, and she relied on her neighbors to help her. I could see the relationship; they have reminded me of that. When you see them, you see how that all works together: a 5-year-old, a 60-year-old and Nita, who will be 90 in April. ''Tina told me, 'We are just going to live our lives and be happy.''' JENNIFER STEINHAUER STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"The morning Hurricane Katrina thundered ashore, Louisiana National Guard commanders thought they were prepared to save their state. But when 15-foot floodwaters swept into their headquarters, cut their communications and disabled their high-water trucks, they had their hands full just saving themselves. For a crucial 24 hours after landfall on Aug. 29, Guard officers said, they were preoccupied with protecting their nerve center from the waves topping the windows at Jackson Barracks and rescuing soldiers who could not swim. The next morning, they had to evacuate their entire headquarters force of 375 guardsmen by boat and helicopter to the Superdome. It was an inauspicious start to the National Guard's hurricane response, which fell so short that it has set off a national debate about whether in the future the Pentagon should take charge immediately after catastrophes. President Bush has asked Congress to study the question, and top Defense Department and Guard officials are scheduled to testify on the response before a House panel today. Other elements of the response to Hurricane Katrina are also coming into question. The New Orleans police chief, Edwin P. Compass III, resigned yesterday after the department announced that 250 police officers -- roughly 15 percent of the force -- could face discipline for leaving their posts without permission during the storm and its aftermath. The former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Michael D. Brown, testified in Congress that he had warned the White House of impending disaster several days before the storm struck. [Page A25.] In interviews, Guard commanders and state and local officials in Louisiana said the Guard performed well under the circumstances. But they say it was crippled in the early days by a severe shortage of troops that they blame in part on the deployment to Iraq of 3,200 Louisiana guardsmen. While the Pentagon disputes that Iraq was a factor, those on the ground say the war has clearly strained a force intended to be the nation's bulwark against natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Reinforcements from other states' National Guard units, slowed by the logistics and red tape involved in summoning troops from civilian jobs and moving them thousands of miles, did not arrive in large numbers until the fourth day after the hurricane passed. The coordinating task was so daunting that Louisiana officials turned to the Pentagon to help organize the appeal for help. At the convention center, 222 soldiers trained in levee repair, not police work, locked themselves into an exhibit hall at the convention center rather than challenge an angry and desperate crowd of more than 10,000 hurricane victims at the center. The near-total collapse of communications made every task far more difficult, forcing some Guard commanders to use ''runners, like in World War I,'' as one put it. With land lines, cellphones and many satellite phones out of action, the frequencies used by the radios still functioning were often so jammed that they were useless. ''I think the Guard has performed admirably -- unbelievably well -- based on the conditions that Mother Nature gave us,'' Col. Glenn Curtis, deputy commander of the state's response to Hurricane Katrina, said in an interview. Disaster experts say that whatever the faults in execution, the 5,700 troops at the disposal of the Louisiana National Guard were far too few. ''What do you expect of 5,700 soldiers when so much of a state is destroyed?'' said James Jay Carafano, who studies emergency response at the Heritage Foundation. ''If we want the military to close the 72-hour gap in responding to natural disasters, we'll have to come up with a new model.'' The eventual military response, which climbed to 35,000 guardsmen and active-duty troops, was widely judged effective. Yet questions about the first few days haunt many Louisiana guard officials: Should commanders have moved their headquarters to higher ground before the storm? Could they have better headed off the lawlessness or built more resilient communications? And especially, could they have moved more troops faster to New Orleans and other devastated areas? ''I think to a man, we will live with the pain of this experience,'' said Col. Douglas Mouton, commander of 2,500 Guard engineers. The restoration of order at the convention center, when it came, was ''phenomenally quick,'' Colonel Mouton said. ''I think the frustration we all have -- the country has -- is, why couldn't it have been done a lot quicker?'' It was Colonel Mouton who made the decision not to send his soldiers into the crowd at the convention center. A 41-year-old New Orleans architect whose own house was destroyed by the flood, Colonel Mouton defended that decision but said the scenes of anguish that became an international emblem of American failure were particularly painful for local guardsmen. ''These are fellow New Orleanians who are suffering,'' he said, ''people that I go to Mardi Gras parades with.'' When the storm hit, 4,000 Louisiana guardsmen were on duty, including 1,250 in New Orleans and surrounding parishes, Guard officials said. By the next day, all 5,700 available Guard members were dispersed around the state, they said. The senior commander of National Guard troops at the Pentagon, Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum, said the Iraq deployment did not slow the hurricane response. He said that Louisiana Guard troops were ''in the water and on the streets throughout the affected areas rescuing people within four hours of Katrina's passing,'' and that out-of-state troops arrived as soon as they could be mustered. But state Guard commanders disagreed. ''We would have used them if we'd had them,'' said Lt. Col. Pete Schneider, a spokesman for the Louisiana Guard. ''We've always known in the event of a catastrophic storm in New Orleans that we'd use our resources up pretty fast.'' There is little disagreement that Guard equipment sent to Iraq, particularly hundreds of high-water trucks, fuel trucks and satellite phones, could have helped speed the response. The chairmen of the Senate National Guard caucus, Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said in a Sept. 13 letter to Mr. Bush that the Guard nationally had only 34 percent of its equipment available for use in the United States. With about 150 high-water trucks available statewide, Guard commanders placed most of them outside the danger zone at bases more than two hours' drive from New Orleans. They risked parking 20 trucks at the low-lying Jackson Barracks so they could be immediately available. Even though the National Hurricane Center warned that Hurricane Katrina might be catastrophic, they did not consider setting up headquarters elsewhere. In 10 years with the Guard, said Col. Tom Beron, who oversees most of the Guard's trucks and drivers, he had never seen more than a few inches of water on the grounds and none inside the buildings. But by midmorning on Aug. 29, as the flood approached the second floor of an armory where 35 truck mechanics, many of them unable to swim, had found refuge, Colonel Beron decided they needed to get out of that building. The trucks were useless. ''There's not a truck in the U.S. Army arsenal that could get through that water,'' Colonel Beron said. After ferrying the mechanics to the three-story headquarters building in a borrowed fishing boat, guardsmen grabbed civilian neighbors as they floated past. ''It was best to have a rope tied to you, because the water would just carry you away,'' Colonel Curtis said. The relocation of the Guard command on Aug. 30 to the Superdome from the flooded barracks assured attention to the huge crowd there. But as word arrived the next evening of the ballooning numbers at the convention center, commanders felt they had no soldiers to spare. By happenstance, there were guardsmen at the convention center: backhoe operators, truck drivers and mechanics who had chosen a huge exhibit hall to stage their heavy equipment. Of the 222 there, almost none were trained in police work or riot control. Many did not have weapons, said Colonel Mouton, the engineers' commander. ''We didn't expect a martial law situation,'' he said. ''We were building levees.'' Thirsty, hungry civilians began banging on the doors. But commanders decided opening them would pose a danger of a stampede. ''We understand we're soldiers,'' Colonel Mouton said. ''But what we had at the convention center was a partially armed group of engineers, ready to operate equipment,'' -- and with enough food and water to anger 20,000 people. On Sept. 1, he withdrew the engineers to the Superdome. Aware that the Guard would be stretched thin, state officials had contacted other states two days before the storm hit about sending troops under an agreement called the Emergency Management Assistance Contract. The day the storm hit, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana asked President Bush for all the help he could provide. After touring New Orleans by helicopter the next day, she asked General Blum, of the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon, to speed and coordinate aid from other states. Some states got troops there quickly. Sgt. Lawrence Ouellette, a Rhode Island guardsman who works as a police officer, was in court in Central Falls, R.I., on Aug. 31, when he got the call. Just 24 hours later, he and his fellow soldiers had flown to a base near New Orleans and then flew by helicopter to the Superdome to help. At least one governor, Bill Richardson of New Mexico, has complained publicly that his early offer of help went unanswered. Officials said New Mexico offered 200 Guard members the day the storm hit, and the troops were packed and ready to move the next day. But no orders were received to move those troops until two days later, Sept. 1, and 400 soldiers finally flew to the hurricane zone on Sept. 2. At the Pentagon, National Guard officials offered no explanation for the apparent delay. An officer not involved in the specific case said the reasons might include lack of aircraft and housing for the troops or uncertainty about their mission. In the weeks since the military presence brought order to the Gulf Coast, officials in Washington and statehouses have suggested that the state-controlled National Guard is no match for a disaster on the scale of Hurricane Katrina. Some have suggested that the military have a domestic force ready for instant deployment, while others say the Pentagon should simply assume responsibility for communications and other support services. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said yesterday that he expected a debate on the military's role. ''It's up to the country, the government, to think that through and decide how they want to be arranged for a catastrophic event,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. Denise Bottcher, press secretary to Governor Blanco, said state officials supported such a rethinking. ''Every piece of emergency preparedness, including the military, should be scrutinized,'' Ms Bottcher said. ''There should be some examination of how we can do this better.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE RESPONSE"
"A desperate housewife in the White House? That was so pre-hurricane. Laura Bush has moved on to reality television. Mrs. Bush flew here on Tuesday for a cameo on ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,'' the blockbuster ABC show that usually does impromptu remodeling for disadvantaged homeowners but is now taking supplies to hurricane victims for segments to be shown later this year. She met with some of the victims, passed out clothing and listened intently to tales of destruction, with a film crew following her and a boom microphone hovering overhead. ''Obviously, there are so many homes to be remade over here,'' Mrs. Bush said afterward. Earlier this year, Mrs. Bush jokingly compared herself to the lonely women of Wisteria Lane during a monologue at the White House correspondents' dinner in which she referred to ''Desperate Housewives.'' With this trip, she continued a pattern of gently incorporating pop culture into her public appearances and using mainstream entertainment as a stage for conveying the softer side of the Bush administration. She went on ''Oprah'' after the Sept. 11 attacks, appeared on ''Dr. Phil'' during the 2004 campaign and has been on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' repeatedly. But with her husband still struggling to regain his political footing many weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, the decision to link her with reality TV had a whiff of the daring. It also suggested that despite an increased effort by President Bush to address the hurricane crisis -- his visit to Texas on Tuesday was his seventh to the area since Hurricane Katrina hit, hers was her fifth -- the White House was casting about for more creative ways to convey its concern and manage public opinion. The appearance had been in the works for months. The producers of the show extended an invitation to Mrs. Bush in April, but it was not until after Labor Day, and the storms, that White House officials found a time and location that worked. Part of the appeal, an aide to Mrs. Bush said, is that the segments will not run until at least November, when public interest in the hurricane relief effort may have diminished but the need for donations and volunteers will remain high. ''The coverage will start to die off a little bit, as people are getting into the hardest time,'' said the aide, Susan Whitson, Mrs. Bush's press secretary. Her intent, she said, is ''keeping this message out there as long as possible.'' Keeping the excitement up on Tuesday was no great feat; if anything, producers had to plead for calm. Storm victims who had gathered at the Biloxi Community Center, where clothes donated by Sears, a show sponsor, were being distributed, waited eagerly with their cameras for Mrs. Bush to arrive. ''People walking in here, this is a surprise for you!'' one director shouted at the crowd. ''Don't stand here looking like you know what's coming.'' Mrs. Bush later addressed the inherent challenge for the show: selecting just one home to rebuild. ''They haven't chosen one yet,'' she said. ''I'm trying to encourage them to maybe choose a school or a library to do, which would help everybody in the community.'' And Tom Forman, the show's creator and executive producer, said he had given no thought to any political reasons the White House might have had for wanting to participate. ''The thing about making this show is I packed up and put away my cynicism a long time ago,'' he said. ''I think given the scope of the disaster, you throw the rules out the window,'' he said. ''And while we're certainly a nonpartisan show, I don't think she was there as a politician or a politician's wife or even as the first lady. I think she was there as someone who cares.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE FIRST LADY"
"Looking back, Bob Ford sees it as a possible touch of divine intervention: the pine tree that Hurricane Katrina sent plunging through his roof narrowly missed him. But the real miracle, he said, happened the night before. When a gospel-music concert he was catering drew a meager crowd because of the coming storm, Mr. Ford and his wife, Jocelyn, decided to drop off the leftover turkey legs and corn-on-the-cob at the Mississippi Coliseum here, where 1,200 evacuees were already huddled. There, he said, he was transfixed -- and transformed -- by one man's story. ''He was a middle-aged white guy, about 5-8 and rough-looking because he hadn't shaved in a while,'' said Mr. Ford, 43. ''He told me he'd walked out of New Orleans, hadn't gotten a ride until he reached the Mississippi border, and hadn't eaten in two days. ''That blew my mind, and I told myself, 'I'm in this for the long haul.''' Before the storm, Mr. Ford, a tall, panther-slim man, was known here as a golf-course owner, caterer and role model for young African-American entrepreneurs. That résumé began to take on a new dimension the day the hurricane arrived, when the Fords returned to the coliseum with their two teenagers and Joe Fulton, superintendent of the golf course, loaded down with food from their company's freezer. They cooked all day for the swelling crowd, even as winds knocked out power throughout the city. When provisions ran short, Mr. Ford appeared on local television to plead for donations. Since then, he and the passionate volunteers he has attracted have served free hot lunches and dinners to crowds that have run as high as 1,700. Dismayed by the doughnuts and drink boxes that the Red Cross was calling breakfast, they got up at 5 a.m. on Tuesday and began doling out eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, grits and coffee. ''I didn't know who he was,'' said Sam Hill II, a food-service veteran who volunteered to help start the breakfast service. ''But he had a glow.'' Mr. Ford has lined up jobs and car repairs, and entertainment for the hundreds of children in the shelter. Last Saturday, he and his troops organized a free wedding ceremony and reception for a young couple who were supposed to exchange vows in New Orleans on the day the hurricane hit. The bride, the groom and 18 of their relatives took up temporary residence this week in the Ford home, 18 miles east of here in Brandon. The tree was still stuck in the roof. ''The power was out and there was a pine tree on our house,'' Mrs. Ford said. ''But we just had to focus on what God wanted us to do.'' BARNABY J. FEDER STORM AND CRISIS: VOICE FROM THE STORM"
"ON Aug. 17, 1969, Hurricane Camille roared onto the Gulf Coast with winds of more than 200 miles an hour, only the second Category 5 storm to hit the mainland United States. It killed 143 people in Mississippi, and 201 more in flooding in central Virginia. Over the years, Hurricane Camille's legend grew, and it was not uncommon when I was a child and student in Mississippi to hear horrific tales from coast residents who had survived it. I myself was sleeping in a Boy Scout pup tent 200 miles inland when the storm swept through. Our losses were minimal -- the tents, sleeping bags, some food -- but over time I managed to spice up the adventure and add a little danger to it. For almost 40 years, it was a well-established belief that the Gulf Coast had taken nature's mightiest blow, picked itself up, learned some lessons and survived rather well. There could simply never be another storm like Hurricane Camille. After walking the flattened streets of Biloxi, though, I suspect that Hurricane Camille will soon be downgraded to an April shower. The devastation from Hurricane Katrina, a storm surge 80 miles wide and close to 30 feet high, is incomprehensible. North from the beach for a half a mile, virtually every house has been reduced to kindling and debris. At least 100,000 people in Jackson County -- poor, middle-class, wealthy -- are homeless. I search for a friend's home, a grand old place with a long wide porch where we'd sit and gaze at the ocean, and find nothing but rubble. Mary Mahoney's, the venerable French restaurant and my favorite place to eat on the coast, is standing, but gutted. It's built of stone and survived many storms but had seen nothing like Hurricane Katrina. Even without Hurricane Rita chewing its way across the region, the notion of starting again is nearly impossible to grasp. Some areas will have no electricity for months. The schools, churches, libraries and offices lucky enough to be standing can't open for weeks. Those not standing will be scooped up in the rubble, then rebuilt. But where, and at what cost? So much has disappeared -- highways, streets, bridges, treatment plants, docks, ports. The next seafood harvest is years away, and the shrimpers have lost their boats. The bustling casino business -- 14,000 jobs and $500,000 a day in tax revenues -- will be closed for months and may take years to recover. Lawyer friends of mine lost not only their homes and offices, but their records and their courthouses. At least half of the homes and businesses destroyed were not insured against flood losses. For decades, developers, builders, real estate and insurance agents have been telling people: ''Don't worry, Camille didn't touch this area. It'll never flood.'' This advice was not ill intentioned; it simply reflected what most people believed. Now, those who listened to it and built anyway are facing bankruptcy. As dark as these days are, though, there is hope. It doesn't come from handouts or legislation, and it certainly doesn't come from speeches promising rosy days ahead. Folks dependent on donated groceries are completely unmoved by campaign-style predictions of a glorious future. It's much too early for such talk. Hope here comes from the people and their remarkable belief that, if we all stick together, we'll survive. The residents of the Gulf Coast have an enormous pride in their ability to take a punch, even a knockout blow, and stagger gamely back into the center of the ring. Their parents survived Camille, and Betsy and Frederic, and they are determined to get the best of this latest legend. Those who've lost everything have nothing to give but their courage and sweat, and there is an abundance of both along the coast these days. At a school in the small town of De Lisle, the superintendent, who's living in the parking lot, gives a quick tour of the gymnasium, which is now a makeshift food dispensary where everything is free and volunteers hurriedly unpack supplies. Two nearby schools have vanished, so in three weeks she plans to open doors to any student who can get to her school. Temporary trailers have been ordered and she hopes they're on the way. Ninety-five percent of her teachers are homeless but nonetheless eager to return to the classrooms. Though she is uncertain where she'll find the money to pay the teachers, rent the trailers and buy gas for the buses, she and her staff are excited about reopening. It's important for her students to touch and feel something normal. She's lost her home, but her primary concern is for the children. ''Could you send us some books?'' she asks me. Choking back tears, my wife and I say, ''Yes, we certainly could.'' Normalcy is the key, and the people cling to anything that's familiar -- the school, a church, a routine, but especially to one another. Flying low in a Black Hawk over the devastated beach towns, the National Guard general who is our host says, ''What this place needs is a good football game.'' And he's right. It's Friday, and a few lucky schools are gearing up for the big games, all of which have been rescheduled out of town. Signs of normal life are slowly emerging. The task of rebuilding is monumental and disheartening to the outsider. But to the battle-scarred survivors of the Gulf Coast, today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow something good will happen. When William Faulkner accepted the Nobel Prize in 1950, he said, in part: ''I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion, sacrifice and endurance.'' Today, Faulkner would find in his native state a resilient spirit that is amazing to behold. The people here will sacrifice and give and give until one day this storm will be behind them, and they will look back, like their parents and grandparents, and quietly say, ''We prevailed.'' Op-Ed Contributor John Grisham is the author, most recently, of ''The Broker.''"
"The water rose even after the rains thinned and the winds lightened. It pushed up from the Gulf of Mexico through coastal canals, dismissed the banks of the Calcasieu River in places and surged across Shell Beach Drive to the steps of the estates overlooking the refineries and casinos on Lake Charles. Here near the Louisiana-Texas border, a region where historical high-water marks are recounted with hand gestures at the knee and the neck and with ominous swipes at the air above, Hurricane Rita left its own mark, and new mysteries. What, who was lost beneath the water? Was it still rising, or was it finally falling? ''It's hard to tell,'' John Butterick, a planner with the Calcasieu Parish office of emergency preparedness, said at midday Saturday. ''We don't know if it's just wind moving it around or accumulation.'' By late afternoon it was still unclear. The water appeared to recede in some places but not others, and not before it had swamped neighborhoods, lifted dozens of boats and barges onto riverbanks and flooded the longest memories. ''Audrey didn't do that,'' said David French, a deputy with the Cameron Parish Sheriff's Office, who was stopped in his patrol truck on Highway 27, southwest of Lake Charles, where downed trees and rising water prevented him from checking on the handful of people who refused to evacuate the bayou hamlet of Hackberry. Hurricane Audrey stormed ashore in 1957, killing at least 390 people in what the National Hurricane Center has long called the most destructive storm to hit southwestern Louisiana. Like Hurricane Rita, it took aim at the Texas-Louisiana border, bringing winds as high as 105 miles an hour to Lake Charles, more than 30 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico in Calcasieu Parish. On Saturday, winds in Lake Charles reached at least 100 m.p.h., Mayor Randy Roach said. This time, however, with the despair of Hurricane Katrina freshly etched, most people got out. Getting back in was another matter. ''Those are our homes down there,'' Deputy French said. ''That's where we live, and we can't get back in.'' A day earlier, Robert Noland, 54, who lives in a house on Shell Beach Drive overlooking Lake Charles, boasted that he did not fear the storm or the rising water, that he remembered Hurricane Audrey and that his house would stay dry. On Saturday his outlook was different. ''I've never seen it like this,'' he said. Not far from Mr. Noland's boathouse, a man spent the night aboard his 18-foot sailboat moored in Lake Charles. ''He said he's fine,'' Mr. Noland said, after driving a small boat through the lake to check on the man Saturday morning. But the water seemed to still be rising, edging over the road to Mr. Noland's driveway and pressuring the man's boat at its anchor. ''He just said to keep checking on him,'' Mr. Noland said. Parts of some low-lying neighborhoods in South Lake Charles were flooded. Roofs were missing from homes and businesses. Power failures were widespread in the city, with utility poles and live oaks leveled across downtown and residential streets and traffic lights often lying in the street. The Civic Center, a shelter for evacuees from Hurricane Katrina until just days earlier, lost part of its roof, and water from the lake filled half its parking lot. Green glass was blown out of the façade of the Hibernia bank building. Some mobile homes were destroyed. Aluminum sheeting flew past rattled horses that galloped endless laps in their pastures. The Interstate 10 bridge over the Calcasieu River was closed to traffic late in the morning for inspections after a barge hit it. Interstate 210, which loops Lake Charles on the south side, was open, despite reports that a tornado may have struck it. It was unclear how many people had been trapped by high water in the coastal parishes bordering Texas. Cameron Parish, geographically one of the largest in Louisiana, has a population of only about 9,000, and nearly everyone had evacuated by late Friday. And officials estimated that about 95 percent of the approximately 200,000 people in Calcasieu Parish, which includes Lake Charles, had evacuated. In Calcasieu Parish, Mr. Butterick said he was aware of at least some people trapped on roofs in the town of Westlake. Water neared the first-floor apartment door of Lynn Cormicle on Prien Lake Road in Lake Charles, but then seemed to stabilize for a few hours. ''Is it going down?'' he asked a stranger. Fears were greater in Cameron Parish, a low-lying area of wetlands, fish camps and farms, where as many as a few dozen people were believed trapped by the water that blocked Highway 27 into Hackberry. State wildlife and fisheries officers arrived late in the day, cutting through trees and hauling johnboats and airboats. Tugboat captains who rode out the storm on their boats apparently were safe. But several people worried about members of the Little family who had stayed to watch over about 500 beef cattle they had corralled to higher ground. Butch Little and his brother, Ernie, both in their 60's, remembered what fields were dry after Hurricane Audrey and steered their herd there. The men had been unable to round up more than 200 cattle grazing farther south near the gulf. ''They may not be there tomorrow,'' Todd Little, Ernie Little's son, said as rain began to rake across his land on Friday afternoon. After the storm, as night began to fall on Saturday, one man, waiting with several others as the wildlife officers took boats into the bayou, said he spoke to the Littles by cellphone at 1 a.m. on Saturday and that they were safe. A woman, Jennifer Buford, said a friend had spoken to Todd Little by cellphone at dawn, ''and the water was up to their necks.'' Another man from Hackberry, Mark Trahan, worried about Todd Little's younger brother, Tim, who had been herding cattle in Johnson Bayou, right on the Gulf, as the storm approached. A call to Butch Little's cellphone was met with an automated message, ''All circuits are busy now. Please try your call again later.'' At nearly 8 p.m., as the water finally began to recede from the edge of the road, Deputy French appeared again on Highway 27. He had news of why rescue workers had not returned with the Littles or others who had decided not to evacuate. ''The people there said, 'We've already made it. We want to go ahead and stay,''' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: LOUISIANA"
"UNTIL recently, an approaching hurricane or tropical storm would force Martin Schleifer to shut down his small advertising agency in Coconut Grove, Fla. ''Every time a storm came, it would be a mad dash to prepare,'' he said on Monday, as Hurricane Rita loomed ominously offshore. ''Losing power essentially put us out of business.'' But last week, Mr. Schleifer was a paragon of calm. Over the summer, he paid $15,000 to buy and install a large standby generator in the 3,000-square-foot house that serves as his agency's office. When Hurricane Katrina hit in August, the generator kicked into gear automatically after the power failed. It ran steadily for six days, shutting itself off when power returned. ''We didn't miss a beat,'' Mr. Schleifer said. He estimated that running the generator, which he bought from Americas Generators in Miami, prevented his business from losing $50,000 in revenue and jeopardizing customer relationships. Powerful, automated generators like his were once found primarily in commercial and municipal facilities, like office buildings. For homes and small businesses, people generally depended on smaller, portable gasoline-powered generators to run a few appliances when the electricity went out. But these days, with electrical grids stressed and an especially active hurricane season under way, home standby generators -- so called because they are always ready to whir into action at a moment's notice -- are increasingly popular. Most of these generators burn natural gas or liquid propane gas, though some use diesel fuel. Those that use natural gas can run indefinitely, as long as supplies are flowing, while those that use liquid propane are typically installed with a refillable tank that can provide power for about a week. Prices can range from less than $2,000 for a 7-kilowatt generator and around $3,000 for a more standard 15-kilowatt version to more than $10,000 for models of 40 kilowatts and above. Installation costs vary from as little as $1,000 for a basic hookup to many thousands for setups that require extensive landscaping, pipe burial or the purchase and installation of propane tanks. In 2003, the market for standby residential generators was $150 million, said Roberta Gamble, who manages the energy research practice at Frost & Sullivan, a consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif. This year, she said, the business will bring in ''closer to half a billion dollars'' and should increase ''at least 20 percent a year'' for the foreseeable future. It has been an event-driven business. Sales climbed significantly after the blackout in the Northeast in 2003, and rose further after the busy hurricane season in the Southeast last year, said representatives of two Wisconsin manufacturers, Generac Power Systems of Waukesha and Kohler Power Systems of Kohler. This year, the demand has been unrelenting. Ron Ford, general manager at TAW Power Systems, Kohler's distributor in Florida, said he expected his 2005 sales to be five times the 2004 level. ''Every time a storm crops up in the Gulf the phones go crazy,'' he said. ''It's become a joke here that we don't even need to check with the Hurricane Center. We can tell when a storm is coming by when the phones light up.'' Greg Cowsert, a sales representative for Guardian, Generac's residential brand, who handles part of the company's Home Depot account, said that his staff began arriving in Louisiana a couple of days after Hurricane Katrina, and set up shop in parking lots.''We'll send 66 units, and we'll get rid of them in about a week,'' he said. The best-selling generators, at 12 to 15 kilowatts, are robust enough to back up selected circuits, but usually will not power an entire house. But these days, people are investing in units of 30 or 40 kilowatts -- enough to run entire households, Ms. Gamble said. Once installed, they require only periodic maintenance, but setting them up isn't always easy. ''If somebody's a very ambitious do-it-yourselfer,'' said Dan Giampetroni, marketing director for Guardian, ''they could prepare the landscape, place the generator, drill a hole, run the gas line, then just hire the electrician and/or a plumber to do your final official connection.'' Most people choose to have an outside contractor do the work. But given current demand, waiting times can be significant. And even when contractors are available, it may take them several weeks to get permits and comply with zoning restrictions. Homeowners in parts of Palm Beach County in Florida, for instance, must show that all doors and windows to habitable space are at least 10 feet from the generator's exhaust outlet and that the sound level is no greater than 75 decibels at the property line, said Rebecca Caldwell, building official for the county. Add the fact that governments are only now writing the rules of the generator game, and the process can easily grind to a halt. MR. SCHLEIFER'S permits for his 40-kilowatt Guardian generator took 60 days to process, he said. Bernard Mintz of Delray Beach, Fla., signed a contract with Personalized Power Systems, in Boca Raton, to buy his 25-kilowatt Guardian generator in February. Its installation was delayed while Palm Beach County officials were revising rules. When Katrina hit, Mr. Mintz was still waiting for the paperwork to go through. ''That was sort of disconcerting,'' he said. ''I could have had it in a reasonable period of time, and we lost our power for a day.'' But he said he was happy with his generator, which on Friday was hooked up to its propane tank. ''It's insurance for us,'' he said. ''If I never have to use it, it wouldn't bother me.'' SUNDAY MONEY: SPENDING"
"Five bayous in low-lying Terrebonne Parish fan out like fingers of a hand, one that squeezed thousands of people in a watery grip on Saturday in the wake of Hurricane Rita. Winds from the south shoved water from the Gulf of Mexico through communities of shrimpers, crabbers and oyster fishermen. The surge topped levees designed for storm drainage but unequipped for hurricane protection, and left vulnerable 15,000 residents of 820 square miles, said Don Schwab, president of the parish. No deaths were reported, but 660 evacuees had been placed in three local shelters by early Saturday evening, with the number expected to rise significantly, Mr. Schwab said. Some 600 inmates from the Terrebonne Parish Criminal Justice Facility were moved to other jails. On Saturday night, water kept rising in Houma, and 70 patients were being evacuated from the Leonard Chabert Medical Center and taken to a hospital in Morgan City, emergency officials said. Four Coast Guard and Army helicopters joined 80 to 100 rescue boats provided by the local Sheriff's Department, the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Department and volunteers, parish officials said. Mr. Schwab said water rose four to five feet in the lowest areas, and some evacuees said it had risen higher. A couple of the most heavily flooded fishing and oil supply communities were not accessible into Saturday evening, Mr. Schwab said, adding that officials had no idea how many people had ignored an evacuation order that was recommended but not mandatory until Friday. Nearly a month earlier, Hurricane Katrina passed to the east and brought little water to Terrebonne. But Hurricane Rita raked past to the west and summoned floodwaters that residents said they had never experienced. ''I'm a native, and this is the worst I've ever seen,'' said Michael DeRoche, director of emergency operations for the parish. ''They've got flooding where I've never seen flooding before.'' The flooding reignited the frustration that south Louisiana officials said they had long felt in requesting money from the federal government to shore up the coastal area's canal and levee system and to replenish the eroded coastal marshes and barrier islands. ''If this doesn't convince people in Washington we need help, nothing will,'' Mr. Schwab said. On Saturday afternoon, at the intersection of Highway 57 and Woodlawn Ranch Road, Terrebonne sheriff's deputies set up a roadblock as water continued to rise from the south. Most of the flooding took place south of Houma. Ann Bonvillian sat in the shade, saying she had moved here after losing everything when Hurricane Katrina submerged her home in Buras in Plaquemines Parish. Now she feared that her mobile home in the North Ashland section of Houma had also been ruined. ''You just want to give up,'' said Ms. Bonvillian, 49, the owner of a tugboat company. Jenesha Smith, 16, a high school freshman, sat across the street at an Exxon gas station with four younger siblings. They had been rescued by boat while their parents remained behind in the community of Bobtown, trying to salvage some belongings. ''We lost everything we had,'' Ms. Smith said, clutching a Winnie the Pooh blanket, several backpacks scattered around her. Some residents of the area grew impatient, wanting to return to check on their homes, relatives and pets, but sheriff's deputies said the rising water was too dangerous. When one truck ran the roadblock, a deputy chased him down in his squad car. Catherine Posche, 65, waited at the roadblock for some sign of her daughter Judy, who had been reluctant to leave her flooded neighborhood. ''Stubborn as a mule,'' Ms. Posche said. ''I told the police, put her in jail and bring me my granddaughter.'' In the midafternoon, trusties hauled food from the Terrebonne Parish corrections facility as water lapped at the door. ''They did a good job of getting us out, better than they did for those people in New Orleans,'' said Lamont Nixon, 29. Several trusties said they slept through the hurricane without hearing much through the reinforced walls of the jail. ''It's one of the best places to be,'' said Mr. Nixon, adding quickly, ''but I'd rather be at home.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE BAYOUS"
"AMONG the countless stories of personal tragedy produced by Hurricane Katrina, some of the most compelling were accounts of residents who refused to evacuate their homes because they would not leave their pets behind. Dealing with a pet in a disaster can be difficult, but experts at animal advocacy organizations say it is not impossible. Anne Culver, director of disaster services for the Humane Society of the United States, in Washington, urges owners to take their pets with them. ''Unfortunately,'' Ms. Culver said, ''many evacuation shelters do not accept pets.'' Because of that, pets need to be taken to a motel or hotel, or an animal shelter. But whatever the options, she said, it's important to plan in advance. Ms. Culver said that the first thing a pet owner should do is put together a pet emergency kit to be used for traveling with the animal. ''You should have at least a three-day supply of food and water,'' she said, noting that it is important to include food the pet is accustomed to. ''You don't want your pet to have digestive problems in the middle of everything else you're going through,'' she said. The kit should also contain feeding bowls, a manual can opener, extra collars and leashes and any medications the pet is taking. It should also have records of the pet's vaccinations, especially important if owners have to leave their pets at a shelter. ''Many animal shelters won't let pets in unless they have proof of vaccinations,'' Ms. Culver said. It is also useful to have a crate or container to transport a pet, and, in the event the pet and its owners are separated, an extra tag on the carrier and on the pet's collar containing information about the owner's intended destination. In case the pet is home and you aren't, and you can't get there because of a disaster, it's a good idea to make arrangements in advance for friends, neighbors or family members to take care of the animal. Additional information on disaster preparedness is available on the society's Web site, www.hsus.org. Joel Hersh, executive director of the Pennsylvania State Animal Response Team in Harrisburg, said that another useful site for pet owners is www.petswelcome.com. The site, Mr. Hersh said, contains a nationwide database of hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfasts and campgrounds that will accept pets. He added that pet owners should assemble or buy a pet first-aid kit in the event a pet gets injured. Such kits are available in many pet stores and on the Web for less than $50. Kelly Harrington, director of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' New York State Disaster Response Services, in Albany, said pet owners should make sure a pet is properly identified. ''The best way is to have a microchip implanted under the pet's skin,'' Ms. Harrington said. She explained that such chips can be encoded with an identification number that can then be matched against a database containing pertinent information about the pet. ''The first thing most shelters will do is scan an animal for a chip,'' she said, adding that another way to identify a pet is to have a database-linked identification number tattooed on the pet's abdomen. Both microchips and tattooing are available for less than $50. Joseph Buttito, coordinator for the Bradford County Animal Response Team in Sugar Run, Pa., who was in New Orleans to assist in animal search and rescue operations, said that ''there is a direct correlation between people risking their lives in a disaster and the presence of pets in the home.'' ''Some pet owners who don't know what will become of their pets just refuse to evacuate,'' Mr. Buttito said. ''And that can be dangerous for the pet and its owner.'' YOUR HOME"
"Business owners can return to the dry neighborhood of Algiers and the central business district in New Orleans as soon as Monday, Mayor C. Ray Nagin said on Saturday, resuming his plan to repopulate the city even as strong winds from Hurricane Rita blew dust and debris down the streets. The mayor predicted that residents could return home to some areas as soon as the end of the week. ''What I hope to do is to very systematically start to repopulate the city,'' Mr. Nagin said at a news conference in a ballroom of the damaged Hyatt hotel here. ''We're just delayed three to five days as far as what we thought we could do.'' The mayor and city department chiefs said Hurricane Rita had done little new damage to the city's infrastructure. Uptown, some power was lost at homes where it had been restored, and 1,300 customers lost power in Algiers. A water purification plant was working in the East Bank, but breaks in the delivery system remained. Retailers including Lowe's and Home Depot are prepared to set up temporary stores to serve returning business owners and residents repairing their property, Mr. Nagin said. But he said that because of the continued risk from hurricanes and weakened levees, he would encourage elderly people and families with children not to return to the city immediately after areas reopen. The mayor had set a schedule on Sept. 15 calling for a third of the city's residents, about 180,000 people, to return this week. Federal officials had strongly urged him to wait, saying the city's infrastructure was not ready, and last Monday, with the approach of Hurricane Rita, Mr. Nagin canceled the plan, calling instead for a new mandatory evacuation. Storm waters surged into the Lower Ninth Ward again on Saturday morning, topping temporary barriers of sand and stone and causing flooding of 4 to 12 feet. In the northern part of the city, there was as much as two feet of flooding. STORM AND CRISIS: NEW ORLEANS"
"As he emerged Saturday morning from the ''battle cab'' deep inside the Northern Command's headquarters in Colorado Springs, President Bush caught sight of a famous image of himself: with bullhorn in hand at ground zero on Sept. 14, 2001. At the invitation of a sergeant major in the Marines, he wrote ''May God Bless America'' on the photo and signed it, before moving on to the next hurricane briefing. But as the White House has learned several times this week, when a president watches the gears of government mesh during a natural disaster, it is hard to find command moments like that one, four years and 10 days ago, when Mr. Bush told the world he was going after the terrorists. On Saturday, Mr. Bush moved from one emergency command center to another, looking concerned, asking questions, thanking emergency workers and trying to figure out how lessons from this storm would help in future natural disasters or terrorist attacks, said the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan. But unlike the events that have defined his presidency so far -- the response to Sept. 11 and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq -- the reality was that there weren't many decisions for the president to make. Rescue and recovery is very different than retaliation and war. No matter. As the country's attention was fixed on its television sets, Mr. Bush was pictured in command centers, a deliberate effort by the White House to strike a different image than the one that dominated a month ago. Here in the state capital, the second of three stops in sun-splashed cities that missed Hurricane Rita's wrath, Mr. Bush headed to the underground Emergency Operations Center, run by the Texas Department of Public Safety. He had familiar faces around: the secretary of homeland security, Michael Chertoff; the two senators from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn; Representative Tom Delay of Texas; and Mr. Bush's successor as governor, Rick Perry. ''Nobody asked for these things, but when they come we have a duty,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'm really here to let the folks in Texas know that the federal government knows we have a responsibility to support you in the mission of saving lives first and foremost and then helping rebuild their lives.'' Partly because Mr. Bush did not want to add to those clogged highways, he stayed away from Houston and the rest of the affected region. But late Saturday afternoon, in the latest permutation of a trip that the White House appeared to have been making up hour by hour, the White House said Mr. Bush would stop in Baton Rouge, La., on Sunday on the way back to the White House. No Ranch Visit This Trip Austin is familiar territory to President Bush. He spent six years in the governor's mansion, not far from that underground command center. He sent his daughters to Austin public schools and has been known to pop down here for dinners and receptions from his beloved ranch, only 105 miles to the north. But however tantalizingly close, the ranch was clearly off-limits on this trip. The last night Mr. Bush spent there was just after the levees broke in New Orleans. While he returned to Washington the next day, flying over the flooded city on the way, his initial presence at the ranch and images of him viewing the disaster from the climate-controlled comfort of Air Force One reinforced the image of a leader detached. No one could afford that on Saturday. So from here, Mr. Bush took his helicopter south to San Antonio, where he described how proud he was of how fellow Texans responded to a time of trouble. Tapping Into the System If Crawford was off-limits, so was the White House. In the past Mr. Bush has told reporters how much he has come to rely on the ''secure video telecommunications system'' at the White House, which allows him to talk to commanders in Baghdad or to Prime Minister Tony Blair in London. He had the system installed on Air Force One, at Camp David and in a trailer across the dirt road from his ranch. On Saturday, he tapped into it in Colorado Springs for hurricane coordination, bringing in Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and military commanders in Louisiana and Texas. He also brought in officials at the White House situation room, a 45-second stroll from the Oval Office. But for Mr. Bush, this was one conference he couldn't conduct from the comfort of home. STORM AND CRISIS: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK"
"The chaotic evacuations of New Orleans and Houston have prompted local officials across the country to take another look at plans for emptying their cities in response to a large-scale natural disaster or a terrorist attack. What they have found is not wholly reassuring. From Los Angeles to Boston, from Seattle to Miami, plans to relocate, house and feed potentially hundreds of thousands of displaced people are embryonic at best and nonexistent at worst. As the exodus from Houston this week demonstrated, in many places highways would clog quickly, confusion would reign and police resources would soon be overtaxed. New Orleans offered a different and more deadly example of what could go wrong, as tens of thousands of people, many of them poor and lacking private transportation, could be left to fend for themselves in cities without basic services or law enforcement. Most major American cities have made preparations for localized emergencies like fires, floods or large toxic spills that might involve the relocation of a few thousand or tens of thousands of people. Since Sept. 11, 2001, cities have received billions of dollars from the newly formed Department of Homeland Security to prepare for a major terrorist attack. But few have prepared in detail for a doomsday possibility like Hurricane Katrina, the storm that engulfed New Orleans and left much of the city a wasteland. Nor have they prepared workable plans to evacuate millions of people with little or no notice, as the residents of the Gulf Coast of Texas learned to their dismay late this week. Officials in Texas are now struggling with how to manage the return of residents. ''Obviously, if you have no notice, it makes it that much more chaotic and confusing,'' said Henry R. Renteria, director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services in California, the state's top disaster-planning official. Evacuating a large urban area is difficult in the best of circumstances, Mr. Renteria said, but California's geography and diverse population -- many residents are newcomers, and more than 100 languages are spoken -- make it doubly complicated here. And no plan ever survives an encounter with reality, he said. ''I'm never satisfied with any plan we have in place,'' Mr. Renteria said. ''They have to be constantly looked at, constantly re-evaluated and constantly revised in light of the lessons learned from those who have been through this experience.'' New York, more than most American cities, has the advantage of a sprawling mass transportation system. Eight million people a day use the system, and officials count on it to be useful in an emergency as well. That could be vital, because city traffic, already a problem in an ordinary rush hour, would pose a significant challenge. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the city has two general evacuation plans, one for hurricanes and another for terrorist attacks. The plans include the opening of hundreds of shelters, mostly in schools. But officials acknowledge that many elements of an evacuation would have to be improvised. Los Angeles, the nation's second-most-populous city, sits atop a spider web of earthquake faults, several of which could slip with devastating consequences, leveling large parts of the city and touching off widespread fires and explosions. But the city has no plan for moving and sheltering the large number of people who would be made homeless by such a disaster, officials concede. ''What happened in Houston is very significant,'' said Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles. ''What they've demonstrated is the difficulties in evacuating that number of people. We're a much larger area. If you'd ever have to evacuate that number of people here, there's no question it would be problematic.'' Emergency response planners acknowledge that no plans exist for moving hundreds of thousands, and potentially millions, of Southern Californians out of harm's way. ''We're going back to the drawing board,'' said Sandra S. Hutchens, chief of the office of homeland security at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ''With an earthquake or a major terrorist attack, we'd obviously have no warning. We haven't looked at mass evacuation or temporary housing for hundreds of thousands of people.'' San Francisco's evacuation plans depend in large part on the two main bridges that connect the city with Oakland to the east and Marin County to the north. Both are vulnerable to a major earthquake, as is the Bay Area Rapid Transit tunnel beneath the bay. The plans call for the use of fishing boats and ferries to get people across the bay if other routes are blocked, a stopgap solution at best. Philadelphia is also dependent on bridges and elevated highways to get people out in an emergency, and the city has drawn up no detailed plans for evacuation since early in the cold war, officials said. Gov. Edward G. Rendell has ordered every city in Pennsylvania to prepare for large-scale evacuations, with an emphasis on the large number of people in major cities who do not own cars. Boston is further along than many large cities, having devised a plan in advance of last summer's Democratic National Convention for moving as many as a million people from the central city in the event of an attack or a major storm. But exercises revealed some flaws in the plan, including inadequate public transportation and a shortage of temporary shelter away from the danger zone. Mayor Thomas M. Menino has asked that the plan be updated to reflect the lessons learned in Texas and Louisiana. Washington is one of the few cities that have tried to exercise a mass evacuation plan. Last summer, after the Fourth of July fireworks that annually draw a half a million or more people to the National Mall, the city used a system it devised to change the timing on stoplights on major arteries leading out of downtown. ''The purpose of the drill was to test our system, to test the assumptions underneath it,'' said Edward D. Reiskin, Washington's deputy mayor for public safety. The test revealed some glitches, but the drill was useful in gathering data. The test was unrealistic in one respect, Mr. Reiskin said. The crowds leaving the Mall were confused, but not panicked. ''It's not exactly comparable to an emergency evacuation,'' Mr. Reiskin said. ''Human behavior, we're certainly seeing now, is certainly a significant factor.'' Chicago officials were reluctant to discuss emergency evacuation plans in detail, citing security concerns. But Andrew Velasquez III, executive director of the city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications, said officials had identified senior housing, nursing homes and homeless shelters and had plans in place to transport their residents to safety in the case of an emergency. He also said the city had an automated telephone system capable of making 1,000 calls a second to alert residents of an evacuation order. In South Florida, signs marking evacuation routes are posted along the coastline, and millions have had to flee hurricanes. Carl Fowler, a spokesman for the Broward County Emergency Management Agency, said his county was better situated and better prepared for hurricanes than was New Orleans. Although Broward, a coastal county just north of Miami, is flat, it is above sea level, unlike parts of New Orleans. And the county has a number of east-west arteries that help coastal residents move quickly inland as a storm approaches. Officials direct traffic toward shelters within the county and away from the state's Interstate highways, Mr. Fowler said, to prevent the monumental and dangerous traffic jams that Texas had in advance of Hurricane Rita. David Schulz, director of the Infrastructure Technology Institute at Northwestern University, said the evacuations of New Orleans and Southeast Texas had revealed significant weaknesses in coordination between the local, state and federal authorities. He also said that Texas' experience showed poor communication between local officials and residents, tens of thousands of whom took to the already-jammed highways even though they were not under a mandatory evacuation order. In Texas, officials acknowledged that they had perhaps overly alarmed residents, leading to an evacuation that proved larger than necessary. ''It doesn't make any sense to have a mass evacuation plan if you don't tell anybody about it ahead of time,'' Mr. Schulz said. ''I do think that it's important that public officials make the public aware in a very forthright and fairly location-specific way what the evacuation strategy is, and I think if we've learned anything the last three weeks, we've certainly learned that.'' STORM AND CRISIS: PLANNING"
"After Hurricane Katrina hit, there was six feet of water in the library at Xavier University. There is a beached boat on a campus made that much soggier by the wind and rain from Hurricane Rita. There is a waterlogged chapel, floors as slimy and slippery as river moss, with chairs and Bibles and plants strewn willy-nilly and a statue of the Virgin Mary perched on a pedestal overlooking it all. Three miles away, there is a pile of rubble at Dillard University where three modular student dorms used to be before a post-hurricane fire burned them to the ground. There is a soggy morass of ruined books and backpacks and notebooks in the student bookstore, a ghostly vista of shrubs turned black by the polluted water that covered the campus for two weeks, and no students, just the chug, chug, chug of trucks pumping out water and drying out buildings. When most people think of higher education in New Orleans, they are more likely to think of Tulane or perhaps Loyola than Xavier and Dillard, two small historically black universities scrambling to get back on their feet. But in the parable of race and inequality left behind by the floodwaters, one chapter still to be written will be the fate of places like Dillard and Xavier, which suffered far worse damage than their wealthier counterparts on higher ground and have tiny endowments, limited resources and students who are almost all dependent on financial aid. Both say they will survive and eventually recover. But that could be a long, slow process, with Dillard researching the possibility of holding some sort of a spring semester away from its home campus and Xavier saying it needs $70 million to $90 million in aid to get it back where it was before the storm. ''I don't have an endowment I can take money from,'' said Dr. Norman C. Francis, the president of Xavier. ''If I can't recover the money we expected for the first semester to pay faculty and staff and pay our bills, we're standing here naked. We have nothing. And what we're looking for now is the help we need so we won't be severely crippled in our ability to come back.'' Higher education, like everything else, took a wallop from the storm in the New Orleans area, where more than 75,000 students had to flee their colleges and universities. All had to shut down, including Tulane, the largest private employer in Orleans Parish. As it turned out, top officials there relocated to temporary office space in Houston, only to have to move again when Hurricane Rita threatened. But few face more daunting hurdles than Dillard and Xavier, both small private universities, with almost 6,000 students between them. The universities are very different places. Xavier's campus consists mostly of taller buildings near downtown. Dillard, built in the 1930's, is a low-rise assemblage of white Georgian revival buildings with stately columns in a sprawling glade of ancient live oaks near one of the canals. Dr. Francis has been Xavier's president for 38 years. Dillard's president, Dr. Marvalene Hughes, took over July 1. Xavier, the nation's only historically black Catholic university, is a remarkably successful generator of black doctors, pharmacists and scientists; it has produced a quarter of the black pharmacists in the country and produces more future black doctors than any other undergraduate institution. Dillard has a more traditional liberal arts focus. But they have at least two things in common. First, for all the sudden attention given to the plight of the black poor in New Orleans, they are a reminder that New Orleans has also been home to a rich African-American cultural tradition of writers, teachers and scholars. Even before the Civil War, New Orleans had the largest and most cultivated population of free, educated blacks in North America. Second, when it comes to resources, very few historically black universities have much of a cushion. So while Tulane, for instance, is hoping to receive insurance reimbursement both for storm damage and for some of the revenue it lost when it had to shut down, neither Xavier nor Dillard could afford business interruption insurance. Tulane's endowment is about $745 million. Xavier and Dillard both have around $50 million, almost all of it restricted to designated purposes. It will take months to make both campuses remotely habitable. Dillard, with virtually all its buildings damaged, wet and infested with mold, faces the tougher task. Their first task is to find money to rebuild. Insurance will cover wind damage but not most of the damage from the flooding, which did the most harm. Their second is to come up with enough operating money to pay faculty and staff members, while they figure out what level they can hope to operate at as they try to plan for a second semester. Both know they will lose faculty members. The United States Department of Education says it still plans to distribute $90 million in student aid to 31 institutions affected by the storm. That represents a portion of $227 million in storm aid to higher education. But Gene D'Amour, Xavier's senior vice president for resource development, said that money alone will not go far. ''It's like you're dying of hunger and someone offers you a cup of coffee,'' he said. Dr. Francis said Xavier is requesting aid from Congress that would amount to $70 million to $90 million for reconstruction, for retention of faculty members and for financial aid to students who now have even fewer resources than they did when they first applied. Its chances of getting that much may be slim, but for now the universities and their allies at the United Negro College Fund are lobbying for more federal aid, hoping to raise money from alumni, private donors and foundations and trying to plan as well as they can for the next semester. Dillard is considering operating from a different site if its campus is not ready by January. Xavier is hoping to reopen Jan. 4 and is working on partnerships with Tulane and Loyola that would allow it to use classroom space there or enroll students in courses at those campuses. And while broken campuses and a diminished city will keep some away, many students insist they want to return. ''My heart's broken,'' said Regina McCutcheon, a senior at Xavier who is president of the student body, ''but every student I've talked to has expressed a desire to go back. We're all feeling like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. There's no place like home.'' With Hurricane Rita adding to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina and Louisiana already being nudged off the front pages, some worry that, as with most other things, the rich institutions will come out of this much better than the poorer ones will. Given the social breakdown that followed the storm, people at Dillard and Xavier say it would be doubly tragic if they emerged battered and diminished from it. ''New Orleans has lost so much of its infrastructure; it can't afford to lose its educational infrastructure as well,'' said Michael Lomax, former president of Dillard and now president of the United Negro College Fund. ''This is a case where the black colleges cannot be forgotten.'' STORM AND CRISIS: EDUCATION"
"WHEN my friend Amy asked her 9-year-old son, Eli, what lessons he had learned from Hurricane Katrina, she, being a rabbi, no doubt expected some noble reflection on self-sacrifice and good deeds. ''Don't live on the Gulf Coast,'' is what Eli told her, and Amy did not have the heart to tell him the exact location of his hometown, Houston. Now Eli has temporarily relocated to Dallas, and I have left my Houston neighborhood for my parents' home here. They happen to be in New England right now, and the New Orleans residents they had taken in two weeks ago graciously agreed to move out so that my son, Sam, my golden retriever and I could stay here while my husband, John, an editor at The Houston Chronicle, is sticking it out in Houston with the cats. This has been a particularly bad season on the Gulf of Mexico, but it's not exactly unusual. While the leaves are changing in other parts of the country, for us it's time to endure the tracking charts, the flash floods, the heat that seems to grow even more stifling just to spite the changing season. I've sat out two hurricanes, and, in 2001, Tropical Storm Allison, which left us marooned in our neighborhood for a day while we watched people on television motor their bass boats up and down the freeways. Hurricane Katrina, of course, was different, because it was so devastating and because it devastated a city most Houstonians love. New Orleans is like a rowdy cousin to us -- it's just an hour or so away by air, so you can leave after work and still make it there for happy hour after work. Of course, as tourists, we never had to acknowledge the other New Orleans, the one that filled our own Astrodome and convention center these last few weeks. Nonetheless, most of us moved aside to make room, volunteered to pack disposable diapers in plastic bags at the Astrodome and cleaned out our closets for the newcomers. It was a classic Houston response, beneficent but also hilariously true to form: one friend e-mailed to tell me that Texas A&M fans were doing so much more than the University of Texas crowd; another criticized Dallas for not doing as much as Houston; after the social pages reported that one of the Louisiana evacuees that another friend had taken in had cooked her an elaborate meal by way of thanks, another member of Houston society called her to ask where to sign up at the Astrodome to get her own Louisiana chef. Then the next storm started brewing in the Gulf, and our period of good humor came to an abrupt end. ''Why does this always happen on the weekend?'' my husband asked in an uncharacteristic bout of churlishness, but I could understand. Houston had been thoroughly enervated by all its good works, and now, suddenly, a storm of equal magnitude was coming straight for us. Everyone knows what happened in Galveston in 1900 -- there's a documentary about it that's far scarier than any slasher film -- and the prospect of a storm surge flooding South Houston so soon after Hurricane Katrina was almost too much to bear. Suddenly, instead of donating money and clothing to evacuees, I was faced with the prospect of becoming one. I didn't intend to flee. Instead, last Tuesday I filled the car with gas, got cash and told myself that leaving was out of the question. The storms always shift direction, and they always decline in strength, so why worry? But then Rita ratcheted from a tropical storm to a hurricane, and then to Category 3, 4 and 5. At the same time, my husband, who had never lived through a hurricane, started suggesting, gently, that it was time to get out of Dodge. How much time did I want to spend huddled in the downstairs bathroom with yowling cats and no air-conditioning? Midmorning on Thursday, a friend up the street who had said the day before she wasn't leaving called to say goodbye; she then posted a painted sheet on her front porch that said, ''Gimme a Rita with salt.'' Sam studied hurricane maps on the Web and then got out the video camera and started filming each room of the house in case we needed a record. He finished a little too quickly for my taste. ''Did you get every room?'' I asked. ''Mom,'' he said, ''this isn't 'MTV Cribs.''' I didn't so much decide to go as much as I just started packing, despite the warnings of chaos on the freeways. In the end, I had the same realization as everyone else in that situation: that stuff is pretty much stuff. I packed T-shirts and jeans, along with my laptop and a jewelry box, not because there was much of monetary value inside, but because it contained pieces my mother had made for me. I asked John to take the photo albums downtown, in case I got stuck in flooding, which has happened before. And then we said goodbye, as if he were just heading out for another day at the office. It was only when I saw how tightly he hugged Sam that I realized how worried he was. When I got to San Antonio, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I hadn't showered that day, and the usual three-hour drive had taken nine or so, many of those without benefit of air-conditioning as the gas dwindled. My hair was flattened against my skull, and my T-shirt was stained with sweat. I looked just like those who fled New Orleans just a few short weeks ago. By Friday afternoon we got the news that the storm had shifted direction and been downgraded to a Category 3. I wasn't surprised -- I've lived on the Gulf long enough to know that's the way it usually goes. ''Real Texans stay,'' one of Sam's friends had told him before we left, and I was sorry that I had reached an age where I just couldn't quite agree.

"Hurricane Rita caused some damage to oil refineries near the Texas-Louisiana border and raised the prospect of gasoline shortages and higher prices during the arduous process of restarting refineries all along the Gulf Coast. But it did not cause the widespread destruction of the energy infrastructure that some had feared. On the edge of this workaday city of refineries and modest ranch houses near Galveston, a flare burned silently from a tower at the large B.P. refinery on Saturday afternoon, evidence that it was largely unscathed. Up and down the energy corridor between Galveston and Houston, industry officials said refining locations had managed to avoid extensive damage from the hurricane, which made landfall to the east, near the Louisiana border. Refineries sat waiting for workers to return to assess their conditions. In Texas City, there were no signs of wind damage or flooding at any refining installations. Egrets gathered in the marshes in the shadow of refineries and petrochemical complexes owned by energy giants like Valero, B.P., Marathon-Ashland and Praxair. A toppled sign from a Phillips 66 gas station was the only indication that a hurricane's edge had passed through. The situation was less sanguine in and near Port Arthur, Tex., and Lake Charles, La., near the Texas-Louisiana border, where officials said they expected refineries and industrial plants to be out of service longer because of heavy wind damage, power failures and scattered flooding. Depending on how much of the nation's already stretched refining capacity is affected and for how long, that could cause shortages of gasoline and other fuels and push up retail prices again. ''It looks like we may have dodged some of the bullet in terms of the impact,'' said John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute. ''It certainly is better than if it had hit some of the bigger refining centers.'' Chuck Dunlap, who rode out the storm with 50 others at Pasadena Refining Systems, just outside Houston, said that at first glance, his plant and other facilities in the area appeared to have sustained limited damage. But even so, it will take a few days for his plant, which normally processes about 100,000 barrels of crude oil a day, to return to full speed. ''We are actually walking through the plant and doing a more detailed inspection,'' said Mr. Dunlap, the refinery's president. ''We won't be at full operations till midweek.'' As the hurricane approached Texas on Friday, Galveston and Houston seemed directly in its path, and had the storm plowed into those cities, laden with petroleum tank farms, refineries and natural gas processing plants, insurance experts feared that losses could have run to $30 billion. But initial estimates put insured damage at $5 billion or less. With hurricane winds extending 85 miles from the center of the storm, Galveston and Houston got heavy rain and strong gusts of more than 75 miles an hour, and they sustained scattered damage. Royal Dutch Shell and Valero Energy said their Houston-area plants would be restarted as workers returned and power was fully restored. Companies shut down 16 refineries that make up about 23 percent of the nation's capacity in the days before Hurricane Rita struck. Less than half of the facilities that closed were in or near Port Arthur or Lake Charles. Valero and Shell both said the wind knocked down cooling towers and power lines at their Port Arthur refineries, but they reported minimal damage from flooding. Valero said it would take two weeks to a month to complete repairs and restart the plant. Hurricane-damage experts said the destruction may have been limited because as the storm churned inland, the refineries were on its west side, where wind speeds are lower, according to Dr. Jayanta Guin, vice president for research at AIR Worldwide, a Boston firm that tracks hurricanes and the damage they inflict. Industry officials warned that the lack of obvious damage should not be read as assurance that things will quickly return to normal. Offshore oil platforms still need to be inspected, and restarting refineries, especially the kind of hulking operations that are common in the region, can take several days, even weeks. During that period, gasoline supplies may start to run short in much of the eastern half of the country, which gets most of its fuel from the Gulf Coast via pipelines. The largest of these, owned by Colonial Pipeline, was operating at about half its usual volume on Saturday because it had lost power at pumping stations. Retail gasoline prices rose to more than $3 a gallon after Hurricane Katrina. Regular unleaded gas sold for an average of $2.748 a gallon on Saturday, down from $2.755 on Friday, according to the AAA. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OIL INDUSTRY"
"Hurricane Rita, with an eye 20 miles wide and wind gusts of almost 150 miles per hour, slammed into the Gulf Coast before dawn on Saturday, causing far less damage than officials had feared but raising new concerns as its torrential rain and storm surges caused widespread flooding across much of the region. By late Saturday, only one death had been attributed to the storm or its remnants; one person was killed in Mississippi when a tornado hit a mobile home, The Associated Press reported. On Friday, 24 residents of a living center for the elderly died when the bus in which they were being evacuated caught fire. Officials said the storm was less deadly than Hurricane Katrina partly because of the evacuation of millions of Gulf Coast residents who had transportation away from the area and heeded warnings, mindful of the flooding, death and destruction of nearly a month ago. Through the day as the storm moved northward, every eye was on the rising waters. In Terrebonne Parish and Houma, south winds shoved water from the Gulf of Mexico through the low-lying lands, topping levees designed for storm drainage but unequipped for hurricane protection. The high water left 15,000 residents vulnerable over an area of 820 square miles, said Don Schwab, president of Terrebonne Parish. More than 650 evacuees had been placed in three local shelters by early Saturday evening, with the number expected to rise significantly, Mr. Schwab said. Water rose four to five feet in the lowest areas, he said, but some evacuees said it had risen even higher. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Saturday night that the storm appeared to be moving inland more quickly than had been expected. Heavy rains were still expected in its path, but forecasters had warned that the storm could stall over the Gulf Coast region, causing rainfall of up to 25 inches over days. In Jefferson Parish, helicopters and boats from the Navy and the Coast Guard rescued about 500 people who were stranded in their homes around Lafitte, La., about 30 miles south of New Orleans, state officials said. It was the largest search-and-rescue mission that had occurred so far in Louisiana in response to Hurricane Rita. Lt. Col. Pete Schneider, a Louisiana National Guard spokesman, said soldiers were ''heavily engaged'' in missions in Vermilion Parish and were trying to make their way to parishes farther west. ''We still are unable to perform evacuation, search-and-rescue missions in those areas due to the high winds,'' Colonel Schneider said. Across Louisiana, nearly 18,000 people were in shelters. And power was out to more than 1.2 million customers in Texas and Louisiana. Houston, where 2.5 million residents choked roadways for hours as they fled the approach of the storm, appeared to have been spared major damage. But Mayor Bill White and Gov. Rick Perry pleaded with residents not to return home yet, saying it was still unsafe to do so because of rain and high winds. Worried that a rush home would result in another nightmarish traffic jam, the Texas Department of Transportation released an unusual plan that calls for people in various sectors in and around Houston to return on different days. Those from the northwest part of the city and from communities to the Northwest were told return Sunday. Those from the southwest are supposed to return Monday, and those just from a small part of the area to the northeast are supposed to return Tuesday. Hurricane Rita made landfall about 3:40 a.m. Eastern time as a Category 3 storm, which carries winds up to 130 m.p.h., with its eye passing just east of Sabine Pass, Tex., near the Texas-Louisiana border. After hitting land, the storm weakened to a Category 2 and later was downgraded to a tropical storm, which has winds of less than 75 m.p.h. President Bush, who was criticized for his administration's slow response to Hurricane Katrina, monitored Hurricane Rita from the United States Northern Command in Colorado Springs and other emergency command centers. James Gunter, the fire chief in Jasper, Tex., about 70 miles north of the coast, said in a interview with KHOU-TV early in the morning: ''We've had fires in the county that we have not been able to respond to -- won't be able to respond to, period. The entire county is without power.'' Chief Gunter added, ''We can go out on the south side of our building and we can look to the south and we can see nothing less than utter devastation.'' Early Saturday, water levels were receding in the upper and middle portions of Galveston Bay as strong winds were pushing the water southward, causing it to pile up across bayside locations of Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. Forecasters said the flooding farther west along Galveston Island, on the north-facing bay shores, was expected to subside by midday. In New Orleans, water that topped two repaired canal levees in the Ninth Ward on Friday because of rain and wind as Hurricane Rita approached began to recede somewhat on Saturday. The Army Corps of Engineers said water had dropped just over a foot in the Industrial Canal by Saturday morning. Plans were being made for helicopters to drop 3,000-pound to 7,000-pound sandbags into a 25-to-30-foot gap where water still flowed into the evacuated Lower Ninth Ward, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, which had been battered by Hurricane Katrina. ''We just have to get clearance with Mother Nature,'' said Mitch Frazier, a spokesman for the corps. The worst damage from Hurricane Rita appeared to be in southwestern Louisiana and East Texas. But the storm also sparked fires in Galveston and Houston. In Lake Charles, La., early unconfirmed reports told of heavy damage to the glass facade of the Hibernia Bank tower downtown, potential damage to casino barges on Lake Charles, and a fallen overpass on either Interstate 10 or Interstate 210, a spur to the south of town. Parts of Beaumont were flooded, and there were indications that water had been swept around Port Arthur's horseshoe-shape seawall. One resident of Orange, a town just to the northeast, called the courthouse to say she was climbing into her attic to escape rising water. Glass blew out of the J.P. Morgan/Chase Tower in downtown Houston, forcing the police to cordon off the area. In coastal counties and parishes, crews of workers rose in the dark early Saturday and prepared to go out at first light to assess the damage, while inland Texas counties like Jasper were still under siege by the storm. ''We're in the process of going through the eye right now, so we've got a lot of rough times ahead,'' Diane Brown, the acting Jasper County Jail administrator, said after answering the telephone at the Sheriff's Office early Saturday morning. In Louisiana, officials from Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes huddled in the Calcasieu Parish Jail, which had been evacuated of all 1,149 inmates before the storm. About 3 a.m. Saturday, wind was rattling the roof and the windows. ''That's the sound of our lives changing forever,'' said Mike Aymond, a Calcasieu sheriff's deputy. But, Deputy Aymond said: ''It'd be a lot worse if New Orleans hadn't happened. People would have stayed.'' Initial estimates by insurance experts put the damage from Hurricane Rita at $5 billion or less, far below the estimated $35 billion in damageinflicted by Hurricane Katrina nearly a month ago and the $30 billion that had been feared had Galveston and Houston taken a direct hit. ''The areas of Texas and Louisiana where this came ashore was far less developed than the coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi where Katrina struck,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. Hurricane Rita also struck with less force. In Jefferson County, Tex., which includes Beaumont and Port Arthur, Carl Griffith, the county judge, estimated that only 10 percent to 15 percent of the county's 250,000 residents had stayed behind, compared with 40 percent in previous evacuations. In Cameron Parish, a low-lying area of bayous, farmland and fishing camps just south of Lake Charles, nearly all of the 9,000 residents had evacuated by late Friday. About 95 percent of the 200,000 residents in Calcasieu Parish, which includes Lake Charles, had evacuated, officials estimated. In Beaumont, windows blew out of the ground floor of the Entergy building, which the county was using as a shelter and staging area for first responders, causing a drop in pressure throughout the building, the tallest in downtown. As the first rescue workers left, the wind continued to shake cars and drive horizontal sheets of rain. The Houston police had confirmed 28 burglaries overnight and arrested 16 people, said Frank Michel, a spokesman for Mayor White. Eight of those arrested, four juveniles, three women and one man, were accused of looting a Target store. Three were arrested at a business on the city's southwest side, and one person was caught stealing beer from a convenience store, the police said. Residents who had not evacuated were warned by the National Hurricane Center to remain in place until Hurricane Rita moved farther inland, because traveling, especially in cars, would be dangerous. In most evacuated areas, officials said it was not safe to return, except in Friendswood, Tex., a suburb of Houston. On Saturday, Army helicopter crews from the First Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Tex., began flying Federal Emergency Management Agency teams whose job it was to gauge damage from the hurricane. ''The air crews are facilitating the movement of personnel to conduct assessments of the conditions in anticipation of the relief effort,'' said Maj. Greg Thompson, the First Air Cavalry Brigade executive officer. The military also sent five mortuary teams from New Orleans to Fort Sam Houston, Tex., and five other teams were placed on alert, according to a statement from the Northern Command, which manages the Pentagon's efforts in domestic emergency and relief missions. Those teams help recover and transport the dead. By early Saturday, more than 50 helicopters, as well as other surveillance and transport planes, were available for damage assessment and search-and-rescue missions, according to a Northern Command statement. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"Federal investigators on Saturday were poring over the skeletal frame of the charred bus in which 24 residents of a living center for the elderly had died while trying to escape from Hurricane Rita. As they looked into the fire, fresh details were emerging about the vehicle and the company that operated it. The bus, run by Global Limo of McAllen, Tex., burst into flames and exploded on the side of Interstate 45 early Friday morning. It was carrying 38 frail residents of the Brighton Gardens home in Bellaire, Tex., away from the expected path of Hurricane Rita to another facility in Dallas. Mark Cross, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation, said Saturday morning that the bus's registration expired in July and that the vehicle had been taken out of service. But it was allowed back on the road because of a waiver signed last week by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas intended to get as many vehicles as possible involved in the hurricane evacuation and relief effort. ''I direct that all requirements concerning motor carrier registration, single-state registration, and international registration plan, and international fuel tax agreement be suspended for motor carriers traveling within or into Texas to assist with relief efforts,'' the governor wrote in a letter to Richard F. Williamson, chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission. The waiver -- for all commercial vehicles, not just buses -- also temporarily suspended limits on the number of hours those vehicles could be operated. The bus that exploded had been on the road for more than 14 hours, traveling from Bellaire, a few miles southwest of downtown Houston, to within 15 miles of its destination when the accident occurred at 6:30 a.m. near Wilmer, Tex. ''I ask all Texas law enforcement and other federal and state officials to honor this letter as a blanket permit,'' Mr. Perry wrote. There were no indications of safety problems with the bus, only that its registration had expired, Mr. Cross said. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said that drivers for Global had been ordered to stop driving five times in the last 33 months, mostly for infractions regarding bus logs. In its most recent federal inspection, in 2004, the company was rated as ''satisfactory,'' with no evidence of major safety problems in recent years. Global filed for bankruptcy in February, although a lawyer for an owner said Friday that this had not affected the safety of the vehicles. Global's offices are in a white, flat-topped structure with green trim, with a mobile home parked to one side, on a commercial strip separating McAllen from the southern suburb of Pharr. On Saturday afternoon, a man identifying himself as Mark Cooper, a San Antonio lawyer for Global and its president, James H. Maples, emerged from the business and declined to answer questions. ''We're not going to comment on the bus or anything else at this moment, until this investigation is further along,'' Mr. Cooper said. Then, he offered a written statement, the second the company has released, in which Global expressed sorrow for the loss of life and promised to cooperate with investigators. Johnny Partain, a former oil industry engineer who now runs a company that installs generators in McAllen, has been embroiled for years in a lawsuit with Mr. Maples over a 1997 investment he made in Global. Mr. Partain said he warned a judge more than a year ago that Global's buses were dangerous and ill-maintained. ''I told them this was going to happen,'' Mr. Partain said. ''I've personally driven those buses. I know what condition they're in.'' Keith Holloway, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, said a dozen investigators arrived in Dallas on Friday and were beginning to sift through the wreckage on Saturday morning. It was just the beginning of what is expected to be a 12 to 18-month effort to discover the cause of the accident. The explosion stopped traffic on I-45 during the evacuation of Houston and the Gulf Coast, creating a 20-mile traffic jam that worsened what had already been a chaotic endeavor. The authorities have not yet released the names of either the dead or the bus driver, who was released from the hospital on Friday. ''We're still interviewing survivors,'' said Don Pertiz, a sheriff's spokesman. ''We want to be as precise and painstaking as possible. It's going to take a while.'' Brighton Gardens had dispatched two buses to the Dallas area on Thursday. The other one got through without incident. Ten of those who survived the crash were taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital. By Saturday, seven had been released. Two of the others were in stable condition, and the third in good condition. A spokeswoman for the Baylor University Medical Center said four survivors were treated and released to a nursing home on Friday afternoon. Eyewitnesses and at least one surviving passenger said that smoke began pouring from a wheel well of the bus shortly after the driver changed a tire. The driver pulled the smoke-filled vehicle over to the roadside, and was struggling to evacuate the passengers when the explosions occurred, presumably from oxygen canisters some occupants used. There are no specific federal regulations for buses or for training bus drivers on how to transport oxygen canisters. On Friday, the federal Transportation Department issued new guidelines restricting the number of canisters in passenger compartments to one per passenger, and only when medically necessary. STORM AND CRISIS: TRAFFIC DEATHS Correction: October 8, 2005, Saturday Articles on Monday and on Sept. 25 included an erroneous account from Texas officials about the legal status of an unregistered bus that exploded and killed 23 passengers being evacuated from the path of Hurricane Rita. The state now says the bus was not covered by a waiver signed by Gov. Rick Perry to let unregistered commercial vehicles take part in the evacuation. A corrective report appears today in the National Briefing column, on Page A16."
"They waited, and they waited, and then they waited some more in the 90-degree heat, as many as 5,000 people huddled at a highway underpass on Interstate 10, waiting for buses that never arrived to take them away from the storm they could not escape. Babies cried. The sick huddled in the shade in wheelchairs or rested on cots. Dawn Ray, 40, was in tears, looking after an autistic niece who had soiled herself and her son who is blind and has cerebral palsy. A few others, less patient, simply started walking west with nowhere to go, like a man pushing a bike in one hand and pulling a shopping cart in another. But most just waited with resigned patience -- sad, angry, incredulous, scared, exhausted, people who seemed as discarded as the bottles of water and food containers that littered the ground. ''Disease, germs,'' one woman, Claudette Paul, said, covering her mouth with a cloth, her voice smoldering with anger. ''We need help. We don't live like this in America.'' New Orleans has always existed in a delicate balance between land and water, chaos and order, black and white, the very rich and the very poor. It has been the lacy ironwork of French Quarter balconies, the magical shops and galleries on Royal Street and the magisterial cuisine not just at Galatoire's or Mr. B's or Commander's Palace but also at humble po-boy joints and neighborhood restaurants in every part of town. But it has also been a place of crushing poverty, of dreary housing projects and failing schools, where crime and violence have been an incessant shadow in daily life, as much a part of the local sensibility as the smothering blanket of heat and humidity. This week, bit by bit, that delicate balance came completely undone. Water took over earth when levees broke, putting 80 percent of the city under water. The mix of fatalism and bravado that allowed the city's biggest fear -- a killer hurricane -- to become the marquee drink of Bourbon Street gave way to terror and despair and horrifying spasms of looting and violence. New Orleans became unrecognizable not just physically, but psychologically as well. Faced with a disaster of biblical proportions, everything fell apart, and government was either overmatched or slow to the task. The flood-control apparatus, which government officials and scientists had long said was inadequate, gave way, but federal engineers did not even realize that a major breach had occurred until the next morning, when citizens began reporting rising flows on Web logs. The city's evacuation plan worked, except for the thousands who were too poor or disabled to find their own way out of the city before the storm. The radios and cellphones that officials and police officers use to communicate failed, erasing any remaining semblance of authority in a city beset by chaos and crime. And finally, a full federal response came only after the dialogue between local and federal officials devolved into anger. Just two months ago, further evidence emerged that the city and its levees were sinking, increasing the risk of a catastrophic flood, even as federal money to protect the city was being cut afresh. As flood waters rose on Tuesday, Senator Mary L. Landrieu tried to impress upon colleagues in Washington that this was America's tsunami, but she said that the more she pleaded, the more she felt she was not being heard. Most local officials who were supposed to be running the city eventually left, mainly because they could not communicate with the outside world, whose help they desperately needed. It took four days for National Guard troops to arrive to restore order as looting and lawlessness spiraled out of control. Mayor C. Ray Nagin said federal aid began flowing after he spoke by telephone to President Bush and told him bluntly: ''Man, this is a mess, and I am not getting the resources I need. I need help, and if I don't get the help I need this city is going to blow up and this is going to be a national disgrace.'' New Orleans, Flannery O'Connor once wrote, is a place where the devil's existence is freely recognized. But not this devil. Not the devil of bloated bodies floating in muddy waters washing lazily over submerged pickups and campers, of corpses being eaten by rats as they decomposed on city streets, of people dying in wheelchairs outside the convention center as friends poured water over their heads to try to keep them alive. Not the devil who left Bill and Gail Orris sitting exhausted, dazed after escaping through the hole they poked through the roof of their home in nearby Chalmette, while their 20-year-old daughter, Lennie, unable to walk and mentally disabled, sucked her thumb and jerked spasmodically back and forth in her wheelchair in the hot sun. Not the devil who left Catherine Weiss, at 75, apologizing profusely for not having her teeth with her -- she had left in a hurry, after all, when the water filled her house like a bathtub -- and panicked about what had happened to her nephew, Michael Phillippello, who collapsed as a boat ferried them across the river to safety. Not the man on talk radio, stranded in his house but begging people not to try to come back to see what they had left behind. ''It's like the five stages of accepting death,'' he said. ''First, I was thinking if I had enough ice to save the good shrimp and tilapia, then it's whether I can save the house, now it's about my life. If I had two AK's I'd feel safe here. As it is, someone could pop me off, and I could end up bloated, no one would check for bullet holes, and I'd just end up in some potter's field. You can feel human life kind of receding like the waters.'' The storm that brought those waters began as Tropical Depression 12, yet another swirl of tropical turbulence in the southeastern Bahamas. But at each step of the way Hurricane Katrina seemed to overachieve. It hit Florida with more power than expected, killing nine people and knocking out electricity for a million more. Then it crossed back into the Gulf of Mexico, intensifying into one of the strongest storms on record as, in a horrific bit of timing, it churned directly over the ''loop current,'' a great, deep whorl of tropics-hot seawater that pulses in between the Yucatán and Cuba each year and then stays south of Louisiana into late summer. Often, storms weaken as they suck up cool water that lies stratified beneath the warm surface. But in the loop, even the depths are hot. ''We are facing a storm that most of us have long feared,'' said Mayor Nagin, who urged people on Saturday to leave town and then gave an evacuation order on Sunday, when it looked as if a Category 5 storm, with winds as high as 175 miles an hour, could be headed for New Orleans. ''This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.'' Many of the 1.3 million people in the metropolitan area did that. But, as always, many did not. This surprised exactly no one. In a 2003 Louisiana State University poll, 31 percent of New Orleans residents said they would stay in the city even if a Category 4 hurricane struck. Many stayed because they felt they had no choice. The survey found that those who said they would stay tended be poor, less educated, disabled, older, childless or isolated, or had lived in the city for a long period. Twenty-eight percent of the population of New Orleans lives below the poverty line, compared with 9 percent nationwide, according to census figures. Twenty-four percent of its adults are disabled, compared with 19 percent nationwide. An estimated 50,000 households in New Orleans do not have cars. And there was another bit of bad timing: the hurricane came at the end of the month, when those depending on public assistance are waiting for their next checks, typically mailed on the first of every month. ''They wouldn't have had any money to evacuate,'' said Councilwoman Cynthia Hedge-Morrell. Experts disagreed on whether there were adequate evacuation plans for those most in need. Brian Wolshon, an L.S.U. civil engineering professor who consulted on the state evacuation plan, said the city relied almost entirely on a ''Good Samaritan scenario,'' in which residents would check on elderly and disabled neighbors and drive them out of the city if necessary. Planning was stymied by a shortage of buses, he said. As many as 2,000 buses, far more than New Orleans possessed, would be needed to evacuate an estimated 100,000 elderly and disabled people. But Chester Wilmot, an L.S.U. civil engineering professor who studies evacuation plans, said the city successfully improvised. He said witnesses described seeing city buses shuttle residents to the Superdome before Hurricane Katrina struck. ''What I've heard is that there were buses, but they weren't very well utilized,'' Professor Wilmot said. ''They literally carried very few people."" The two professors agreed that the evacuation of New Orleans residents with cars went well. They said a new ''contraflow plan,'' which used all lanes of I-10 for outbound traffic, avoided the kind of traffic that snarled during a voluntary evacuation of the city during Hurricane Ivan in 2001. ''What you're going to find is that everyone who wanted to get out, got out,'' said Professor Wolshon. ''Except for the people who didn't have access to transportation.'' But many other stayed because they wanted to stay. Because their friends were staying. Because they were worried about looters if they left. Because they felt they could protect their property by staying home. They stayed because they had elderly parents who were going to stay, because they thought they knew which parts of the city flooded and which did not. Or because they always had. ''Hard-headed, honey,'' said Mrs. Weiss, when asked why she rode out the storm in the same brick home where she has stayed for storms for 41 years. ''From now on, I'm leaving for a tropical storm.'' And then there were the tourists, many of whom came with only the haziest sense of what they were facing and not the slightest idea of what they should do. When Chris and Tammy Distefano, Kris and Mike Miller and Chad and Michelle Toomey arrived from York, Pa., on Saturday morning for their first trip to New Orleans, they asked the limo driver, Joseph, what to expect. Not much, he answered. The storms always went somewhere else. He took them on a tour and dropped them off at their hotel. They dropped off their bags and walked over to Pat O'Brien's for a hurricane, the mix of dark rum, passion fruit and other juices that people drink from plastic cups as they tour the French Quarter. They were scared to death as the storm rattled their hotel, shutting off the power, Sunday night and Monday morning. But as Monday rolled into afternoon and the storm moved west, people peeked outside to find streets battered, trees down, roots torn up, but the city mostly dry. It looked like the N'awlins luck had held again. Thriving on Bluff And why not? For generations -- centuries, really -- this city had thrived in part on the poker-hand bluff, its sheer allure masking its starker realities. Eighteenth-century accounts sent back to France as the first settlers carved into the Mississippi silt focused on the fanciful, not the real, said Craig E. Colten, a geographer at L.S.U. and the author of a new book on the city, ''An Unnatural Metropolis.'' Few entrepreneurs seeking to sell the idea of building a town on this swampy island mention that as they dug into the earth, they came upon recently buried tree trunks -- a sign that they were standing on land laid down by epic floods. And as the city grew, wedged between the Mississippi River and the broad, shallow Lake Pontchartrain, so too did efforts to ring it with earthen levees. But the very expansion of the city contributed to the rising flood risk, Dr. Colten said. As swampier spots were drained, the drying soil compressed, causing reclaimed land to sink ever more. In the 20th century, more land was drained as the city's legendary system of pump stations and purging canals spread. But that made it sink all that much faster. Hurricanes feeding on warmth from the gulf rumbled by most summers. Some potent ones smashed other Gulf Coast towns, like Galveston, Tex., in 1900, and storms in 1947 and 1965, struck New Orleans directly, but with survivable intensity. Hurricane Betsy, in September 1965, finally spurred a federal hurricane protection plan for Lake Pontchartrain and vicinity. But the system that emerged was a compromise from the start, cut back by competing Army Corps of Engineer projects, by pressure from local communities that had to pay part of the tab, and by the tendency to focus more on current costs than on future risks. Officials settled on a system of levees sufficient to protect against another Hurricane Betsy -- roughly akin to what is now called a Category 3 storm, the kind that statistics estimate might strike New Orleans once in 200 years. A lull in Atlantic hurricane frequency from around 1970 until 1995 probably contributed to complacency, said Bob Sheets, a former director of the National Hurricane Center. But more recently, a string of studies found that after 1995, a natural Atlantic cycle had switched from the pattern that stifles storms to one that nurtured them. Other studies pointed to an eventual increase in storm intensity from global warming. Computer simulations showed ever more clearly how New Orleans could swamp like a low boat in high seas under the assault from certain hurricanes. Still, the compromises over flood protection persisted. After a scare from Hurricane Georges in 1998, Congress authorized the Corps of Engineers to begin studying bolstering the city's defenses against a Category 5 storm. But money for that study, and simply for finishing the last components of the original plan to protect against a Category 3 storm, dribbled in district at a fraction of annual requests. In 2004, with insufficient money to close contracts with the companies doing the work, Alfred Naomi, a senior district project manager, told the local East Jefferson Levee Authority, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune: ''The system is in great shape, but the levees are sinking. Everything is sinking, and if we don't get the money fast enough to raise them, then we can't stay ahead of the settlement.'' This year, the New Orleans district was hit by a $71.2 million cut. Without more federal money, the district reported in May, the raising of various levees and other ''pressing needs'' would not be met. In June, at a meeting of emergency planners and hurricane experts, Roy Dokka, an L.S.U. engineer who has spent much of his career refining measurements of elevations around the gulf, presented findings that parts of the coast and New Orleans were sinking 2 to 50 times faster than earlier estimates. Many spots were two to four feet lower than anyone thought, recalled Stephen Baig, a National Hurricane Center meteorologist, a chilling hint that calculations of the flood potential of particular storms, and the vulnerability of levees, might be significantly underestimated. ''For levee heights, and for our models,'' Dr. Baig recalled, ''that could mean the difference between overtopping and not overtopping.'' On Monday, there was nothing dramatic when the levee failed, no sound of an explosion or a crash. At midday, as the storm was blowing out of the city, the Web site of The Times-Picayune quoted residents near the 17th Street canal saying that after experiencing only minor flooding from the storm, suddenly the water in their yards was rising from what seemed to be a breach in the canal. One man said later that afternoon that the water was rising one brick on his house every 20 minutes. By 4:20 p.m. on Monday, the Web site reported that the water had already rolled through the nearby Lakeview neighborhood and on down to the center of the city. By then, the water in Lakeview had reached the second stories of many houses. The berms along Lake Pontchartrain had held. The problem was in canals that had been built to carry water pumped from city drains out to the lake. But on Monday, with the lake rising, the flow in the canals reversed. A surge, probably 10 feet above normal, flowed in from the lake, rising until it began cascading over the top of the sleek, butter-colored walls that stood between the east side of the 17th Street Canal and the city's Bucktown neighborhood. Greg Breerwood, a deputy district engineer for the Corps, said it appeared that as the weight of the water pressed on the high part of the wall, the water pouring over the top hit the ground on the other side and ate away at the soil supporting its base. A section of the wall pushed in and the rush of water turned that breach into a gash as broad as a football field is long. The lake and below-sea-level city were becoming one body of water. ''We heard about the flood wall failing,'' Mr. Breerwood said. ''Then we realized there was an open corridor to the city.'' A Reluctance to Leave Once the levee broke, most long-time New Orleanians knew that the city could unravel quickly, with nothing to stop the lake from pouring into neighborhoods that were still dry and surging across a huge city park and into downtown. Ms. Landrieu, a Democrat who grew up in New Orleans, whose father, Moon Landrieu, had been mayor, whose brother, Mitch, is currently Louisiana's lieutenant governor, was at the federal and state command center in Baton Rouge when the first warnings about the break flashed on Monday afternoon. Ms. Landrieu knew how reluctant people could be to leave. This was the first time her own father had ever left during a hurricane. She said in an interview that she knew instantly that thousands who thought they had survived the storm would now be trapped in their houses, racing the rising floodwaters to their second floors, or to their attics or rooftops. But she and other local officials suddenly faced a new problem: convincing federal officials that just one break in one canal with such a mundane name could bring on a cataclysm. ''I have been with Michael Brown since the minute he landed in this center,'' Ms. Landrieu said Friday in Baton Rouge, referring to the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, ''and I have been telling him from the moment he arrived about the urgency of the situation.'' But, she said, ''I just have to tell you that he had a difficult time understanding the enormity of the task before us.'' Natalie Rule, a spokeswoman for FEMA, disputed Ms. Landrieu's account. ''There was no doubt in our minds that a Category 3, 4 or 5 headed for New Orleans was going to be dangerous,'' Ms. Rule said. She said agency officials told state and local leaders: ''We will be there for you. You just go for it. We've got your back.'' But if they did, no one knew it. And as the flood-control system broke down, so soon did everything else. There was no immediate announcement that the levee had been breeched or what it meant, but different people realized at different times that maybe the bullet had not been dodged, after all. The prestorm evacuation, as chaotic as it seemed to anyone stuck on the road, was still part of a plan. Now , a whole new ad hoc stage began. The tourists from York ventured out Monday to see gangs of youths, maybe four, then a dozen, then another four, breaking into the Canal Place Mall, home to high-dollar retailers like Saks and Gucci, Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor. Worried that things were slipping out of control, they managed to make a plane reservation at $637 a ticket to get out of town. A local family staying at the hotel drove them out for $100 a head, the best money they ever spent. There had been no plans for what to do with stranded tourists, and before long, the hotels were closing down. With the Superdome overloaded and without food or air-conditioning, the hotels guided visitors to the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, a huge rectangular building that stretches about a mile and is several hundred yards wide. It has been used for conventions with more than 70,000 people. But soon the situation there devolved into anarchy, too, to the point that officials, often circumspect and cagey with the news media, were just the opposite. ''The tourists are walking around there and as soon as these individuals see them, they're being preyed upon,'' said P. Edwin Compass III, superintendent of police. ''They are beating, they are raping them in the streets.'' The Flooded Ninth Before dawn on Tuesday, Ms. Landrieu's brother, the lieutenant governor, and Sgt. Troy McConnell of the state police left Baton Rouge to assist in the rescue of flooded residents of the Ninth Ward in New Orleans. Mr. Landrieu knew the city intimately. But now he was navigating the Lower Ninth Ward not by car, but by boat. The four men on board would cut the engine and float in watery silence, listening for calls for help from inside houses or attics. People yelled from rooftops or waved shirts or rags, as if they were flags, from vents in the attic. A few wooden houses floated like buoys. It had become so hot inside the fetid houses that some residents shivered in the cold water as they swam to the rescue boat. One woman was so heavy and immobile that 12 men were needed to lift her off a gurney. They must have rescued 100 people, but by the end of the day the mood began to change to one of irritated impatience. ''By dusk, people were getting agitated and upset,'' Sergeant McConnell said. ''They had been in those houses for two days with nothing to eat or drink.'' Soon there was a small army of evacuees, refugees with no place to go who were deposited on the island of dry land at the edge of I-10 in Metairie. During the long, hot afternoon and into the humid night, the crowd swelled to 2,000 hungry, flood-weary people, residents of the northern neighborhoods of New Orleans and of St. Bernard Parish to the northeast who had been plucked from their roofs and attics. Barefoot women cradling naked, screaming babies limped from a National Guard rescue truck, everything they owned on their backs after 36 hours of watching the floodwaters breach their doors, topple their refrigerators and drive them to the only high ground available -- roofs, trees, attics and bridge spans. Behind them, elderly couples in nightgowns and slippers leaned on each other for support as they walked slowly from the helicopter that rescued them. Many clutched garbage bags holding all the possessions they could salvage; many had no more than damp tank tops and shorts clinging to their bodies. Most were hungry, thirsty and alone. Chermaine Daniels, 49, had left her flooded one-story house in the Ninth Ward on Tuesday morning, gashing her ankle on a fence as she struggled to swim to a neighbor's two-story house. Later that day, Ms. Daniels and several others were rescued by a uniformed officer in a boat and deposited at an I-10 encampment. ''What do we do now?'' she asked the boat driver. ''You're on your own,'' the driver replied. An Array of Complaints Increasingly, local officials also felt that they were on their own. On Tuesday night, Mayor Nagin complained that while federal officials had agreed that morning that stemming the flow from the breach was the highest priority, ''it didn't get done.'' Ms. Landrieu said she had talked to Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, on Tuesday and told him: '''You remember when I flew over the tsunami with you? This was worse than anything we saw.' He said, 'No, you've got to be kidding.' I said, 'I know it's hard to grasp.' And he said, 'We're on it.''' Mr. Frist's office did not respond to requests for comment. By Wednesday, with little visible response from the federal government, Ms. Landrieu said that she talked to FEMA officials. ''I started to sense they were thinking I was a little overwrought, that maybe I was exaggerating a little bit,'' she said. When she pressed Mr. Brown on when he was going to finally get buses to pick up the people who had been trapped at the Superdome, ''he just mumbled,'' she said. Mayor Nagin said that he could not remember whether he spoke to President Bush on Wednesday or Thursday, but that the president acknowledged the federal government could have done more and promised to fix the situation. By then, the state leaders also had an array of complaints. People were infuriated about the lack of National Guard troops to keep order and end the looting. How could the Corps of Engineers, which builds and takes care of the levees, have not had a contingency plan for dealing with a levee breach, especially in such a critical spot? And each time another federal agency offered to help, FEMA seemed to delay in providing guarantees that it would reimburse them later. For instance, a defense agency had packages of communications gear ready to deploy and held them while awaiting FEMA's approval, according to two congressional aides. Inside New Orleans, city officials were trying to keep some semblance of control over their city, and failing. The most basic reason was a massive breakdown of the communications system. Cellphones failed and satellite phones did not arrive for several days, according to Representative Charlie Melancon, a Democrat who represents suburban New Orleans. Ms. Landrieu said on Wednesday: ''Our communications systems are not functioning adequately; they are compromised. Not Louisiana's communications system. The United States of America. We didn't have the right communications system for 9/11. We don't have the right communications system now. By that I mean the simplest things. A police chief in a city talking to a mayor in a city wasn't happening while this was going on because their cellphones were down and their radios didn't communicate.'' The flooded city was also becoming lawless. Even in better times, New Orleans has more than its share of crime, with one of the nation's highest big city murder rates. Now, as law enforcement was all but swept away by the storm, there were acts of desperation and acts of depravity. As water rose into his home on Tuesday, Louis Martin Sr., a 36-year-old truck driver, said he commandeered a flatbed truck to rescue his family from the second floor of a neighboring home. He then made several trips, ferrying neighbors to the convention center at the instructions of a police officer. By now the crowd there had reached about 25,000 people. On Wednesday, Mr. Martin said, armed youths appeared when evacuation buses didn't. ''They had guns and they were looking for someone,'' he said. ''I saw two boys running. There were shots.'' At the convention center, food and water grew scarce. Dead bodies sagged in wheelchairs. Residents reported hearing burst of sporadic gunfire. A number of city police officers walked off their jobs in despair. By Wednesday, many city officials left for Baton Rouge, mainly because they could not communicate with the outside world and they needed to work with federal and state leaders directing operations from the command center there, said Ms. Hedge-Morrell, the councilwoman. In Baton Rouge, she said, ''we could yell and scream and keep fussing at them.'' By Thursday, local officials were yelling and screaming in public. Col. Terry Ebbert, director of homeland security for New Orleans, complained that the whole recovery operation had been ''carried on the backs of the little guys for four goddamn days,'' and ''the rest of the goddamn nation can't get us any resources for security.'' He added, ''It's like FEMA has never been to a hurricane.'' Finally, Hope Friday, for the first time, there was a dose of hope. President Bush's visit to New Orleans, where he met with Mayor Nagin, and to the rest of the tattered Gulf Coast region, helped calm some of the tensions. Referring to the federal emergency actions, Mr. Bush said: ''What is not working right, we're going to make it right.'' The first sizable contingent of troops rolled into town and restored a measure of order to the convention center. There was food and water. There was a sense that maybe, things at least would stop getting worse. But at a time when the nation fears disaster as never before, there was a horrific view of how unprepared emergency preparedness can be. Louisiana's other United States senator, David Vitter, called FEMA's response completely dysfunctional, completely overwhelmed. He said the death toll might reach 10,000 unless the rescue is speeded up. ''Hopefully today is the turnaround, that is my prayer,'' Mr. Vitter, a Republican, told reporters traveling with Mr. Bush. But this sense of expectancy dissipated at the causeway on I-10 where the crowd of refugees had swollen from about 2,500 to 5,000, according to Lt. Michael R. Field of the Louisiana State Police. ''It's worse today,'' he said. ''It's not evacuating to move people from one part of the city to another. We need to get them out of this situation.'' '' Some of the sick were being helicoptered to a field hospital at the airport. But Dr. Alan Hinton, a surgeon volunteering his time, said it was difficult to tell who was most in need of help. ''There's no organization,'' he said. Jerome Wise, 46, who said he retired with a disability as a postal worker, tripped as he climbed out of a helicopter and shattered the one possession he had taken from his flooded home a framed family photograph. His wife and seven of his children were somewhere in Mississippi. His eighth child, Calvin Holmes, was with him. He had been born 19 years ago on this day, but there was not much to celebrate here. ''Doesn't feel like a birthday,'' Mr. Holmes said. STORM AND CRISIS: A LOOK BACK Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"I CALLED my home in New Orleans Wednesday to listen to the phone ring. I didn't call for messages, knowing that without power the answering machine had not taken any. I called to connect to my home. No neighbors remained to talk to. The few who had remained through the storm and through the first part of the week had finally gone. Listening to the ring, imagining it echoing through the silent house, its sound waves caressing so much that I loved and so much of my life, I was reluctant to hang up. It seemed as if hanging up meant abandoning my home and my city, as if I were holding onto it, and hanging up meant letting it all go. What we are seeing is well beyond the worst natural disaster in American history. We will never know the exact death toll, the direct monetary loss will easily exceed that of any other disaster, and the entire population of the New Orleans metropolitan area and much of the Gulf Coast will soon be scattered across much of the country. We may also be seeing the virtual destruction of one of the world's great cities as well. In a way, though, that seems the least of the thing, and less important each day. The initial inability of local or national government to respond, our own impotence and rage over events, and the worst of it, the rapid descent into chaos -- more like Baghdad or Mogadishu than an American city -- each one of these things may be more disturbing than the heart-song of the loss. How did it come to this, and where does it go? Geology and economics answer part of the first question. All the land in the Mississippi River's flood plain from Cape Girardeau, Mo., to the Gulf of Mexico -- more land than Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont combined -- was created by the deposit of sediment by the river. New Orleans itself was located at a point particularly conducive to commerce, and the first areas settled were relatively high ground (and remain dry today). Levees, which go back to the Tigris and Euphrates, had long been in use to control floods, and also helped guarantee a shipping channel; until 1928 virtually all federal money for levees was justified by the river's role in interstate commerce. This effort was, in effect, to channel the river, and it has largely succeeded. Levees have contained all floods on the lower Mississippi -- which routinely carries triple the amount of water in the river at St. Louis -- since 1927. Then canals and pipelines were cut through the marsh below New Orleans to make shipping and energy production more efficient. New Orleans benefited from all this, but not as much as Midwest agriculture exporters or steel importers, which enjoyed cheaper freight, or the entire nation, which enjoyed the oil and gas pumped out of the gulf. But only south Louisiana has suffered from the trade-offs. No floods meant that the river no longer replenished the land each year with silt, so south Louisiana parishes began to sink. And the canals cutting through the marsh accelerated erosion. The result: the equivalent of the island of Manhattan disappears every 10 months. That explains the physical vulnerability of south Louisiana today. It does not answer the most disturbing question: How has New Orleans come so close to collapse? For what we are witnessing bears no resemblance to what has happened in the past. Before this, the flood on the Mississippi River in 1927 was doubtless the most terrible American disaster. In one obvious way, it eerily foreshadowed today's. For one thing, New Orleans officials loudly warned that a disaster was waiting to happen, and condemned Washington for ignoring them, just as last week's devastation was widely predicted. The scope of the 1927 devastation also resembled today's. No one knows the death toll. The official government figures said 500, but one disaster expert said more than 1,000 in Mississippi alone. The homes of roughly one million people, nearly 1 percent of the entire population of the country, were flooded. The Red Cross fed 667,000 people for months, some for a year; 325,000 lived in tents, some sharing an eight-foot-wide levee crown with cattle, hogs and mules, with the river on one side and the flood on the other. Even amid that horror, as in other natural disasters, people responded by bonding together. Goodness emerged. The fault lines of race and class melted away with the levees, and the commonality of the burden that victims shared created a sense of common humanity. But as days dragged into weeks, honor and money collided, white and black collided, regional and national power structures collided. The collisions cracked open the fault lines and caused America to stagger and shift as well. As a result, Americans rethought the responsibility the federal government had toward individual citizens. The government had felt little such responsibility. In 1905, a yellow fever epidemic struck New Orleans. Scientists knew how to fight yellow fever, and the Army had completely eliminated the disease from Havana. Yet, before the Public Health Service would come to New Orleans to save the lives of Americans, the city had to raise $250,000, in advance, to cover the expenses. Americans accepted this. But in 1927, even after the expansion of government during the Progressive Era and World War I, not a single federal dollar went to feed, clothe or shelter any of the 667,000 being fed by the Red Cross. (Indeed, the Army even demanded reimbursement from the Red Cross for use of its field kitchens and tents.) Americans did not accept this. Overwhelmingly they expressed a new belief that the government should help the flood victims and, by implication, other individuals in distress through no fault of their own. This represented an enormous shift in public attitudes. The flood left other legacies almost as significant. It sent hundreds of thousands of blacks out of the flooded territory to Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles. Enormous positive publicity created the presidential candidacy and guaranteed the election of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, who had been in charge of the rescue effort. Yet his subsequent betrayal of the national African-American leadership and African-American refugees snapped the emotional bond black voters felt for the G.O.P., the party that freed the slaves, beginning the shift to the Democratic Party. The flood also left a legacy directly relevant to today. It led to the passage of the 1928 Flood Control Act, which was the most expensive bill Congress had ever passed, exceeded only by the cost of the Civil War and World War I. That same bill set a precedent redefining the relationship between the federal and state governments, and for the first time gave the federal government full responsibility for flood control along the lower Mississippi and many tributaries.Today we face a disaster even greater than the one in 1927, and for all the similarities a single difference between now and not only 1927 but the other natural disasters is most striking. That sense of common humanity, of a shared burden, did not dominate the immediate aftermath of Katrina. Why not? It is understandable that when no market or restaurant is open to sell food and water, people break into them to survive. As things escalate, some people go the next step and become looters. Once order begins to break down it is difficult to redraw the line. But how to comprehend the hell, the breakdown of society, the snipers shooting at hospitals, shooting at helicopters trying to evacuate people? Yet perhaps this explains it: This disaster was not a common burden. Many people who stayed in New Orleans chose to. But many, and probably most, of those who remained either paid too little attention to the warnings or would have gotten out if they could. Once the levee gave way things deteriorated instantly. Communications between rescue personnel, between government officials became almost impossible. Things soon became so bad a senior aide to the mayor broke into an Office Depot to commandeer communication and computer equipment to rebuild a command post when water knocked out the original one. The population, without power, had no information from television or radio. Troops are finally taking control of what may never again be called the Big Easy. Midwest farm exports still need cheap freight to compete in the world market, and the nation still needs the oil and gas from the gulf; moving that infrastructure and building new refineries would cost billions and take years. If -- a major if -- the existing plan to reverse the coastal erosion will work, then it and the cost of protecting the city against hurricanes may well pass even a cost-benefit test. But past the question of rebuilding this city, my home, will this disaster leave an imprint like the 1927 flood? Will it cause the world to change the way it engages the environment? Will it cause Americans to think about the role of government and this newly seething underclass? I don't know. On Thursday, I tried to call my house once again, to listen to the phone ring. I could not. The phone no longer works. THE NATION John M. Barry of the Center for Bioenvironmental Research at Tulane and Xavier Universities is the author of ''Rising Tide,'' about the 1927 Mississippi flood, and ''The Great Influenza.''"
"In covering the compelling story of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, no network news anchor gained more than Brian Williams of ''NBC Nightly News,'' who has led the network newscast competition since succeeding Tom Brokaw last December. In what was an enormous week for television news, Mr. Williams saw his audience jump by more than 2.5 million viewers, or about 30 percent. . ABC gained about 2 million viewers, and CBS about 1.2 million. More importantly for Mr. Williams, his presence in New Orleans from the start of the story, as well as his authoritative, frequently passionate reporting on the toll of the disaster, had colleagues, competitors and outside analysts suggesting that the hurricane story may have provided him a defining moment as a network reporter and anchor. NBC and Mr. Williams have been seeking such a moment to establish him as a worthy successor to the anchor triumvirate of Mr. Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings, who all left network news -- two through retirement and one through untimely death -- over the past year. ''It has been an impressive performance,'' said Lawrence Grossman, the former president of both PBS and NBC News. ''I no longer have any loyalty to NBC, but I would say Williams has been leading the crowd. He got down there and reported from the scene. That is that old-fashioned quality that the old guys had. It's much more difficult to stand out now, because there are so many players. But I'd say Williams earned his spurs on this story.'' Joe Angotti, recently retired as chairman of the broadcast department at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, said: ''He's been out on the scene, reporting, anchoring without a teleprompter. He really has stood out.'' Mr. Williams was quick to rush to the scene when the forecasts of a Category 5 hurricane began to come in. Initially that meant only that he was competing with the hordes of other television news reporters trying to stand up in gale-force winds and speak into a microphone at the same time. But Mr. Williams got inside the Superdome and that put him in position to continue reporting from the city as the flooding became a calamity. The emotion and exhaustion finally hit Mr. Williams on Friday. ''We've all seen terrible things here,'' he said in a telephone interview from Baton Rouge, La., where he had moved after five days of near 24-hour shifts covering the story from in and around New Orleans. ''I've seen dead bodies, a lot of dead bodies,'' Mr. Williams said, his voice ragged. ''I've seen the harrowing desperation in the eyes of people just before their own death or the death of a loved one. I've seen things I never thought I'd see in the United States.'' . Like the reporting of some other journalists on the scene, Mr. Williams's reporting took a turn in midweek when relief seemed to be so late in coming. On Thursday night, when NBC expanded its newscast to a full hour, Mr. Williams introduced segment after segment with a growing sense of outrage in his voice. ''Rescue workers overwhelmed, food and water scarce, people left behind, becoming more and more unglued,'' he said. ''Where is the help?'' He added, ''The people inside the city of New Orleans are asking repeatedly to people in Washington, 'Are you watching? Are you listening?''' STORM AND CRISIS: THE NEWS ANCHOR"
"THE fried green tomatoes, crowned with shrimp remoulade, were as divine as ever. Bowls of succulent andouille gumbo were set steaming on tables. The kitchen at Jacques-Imo's on Columbus Avenue at 77th Street, the Upper West Side outpost of the funky, famous New Orleans restaurant of the same name, cranked out its signature fare after Hurricane Katrina devastated its hometown last week. But the usual revelry had completely vanished. ''It's kind of like a therapy session here,'' said the owner, Jimmy Goldman, noting that 80 percent of his staff comes from New Orleans. On Monday night, after the hurricane hit, they cried together. On Tuesday night, some were so distraught that Mr. Goldman let them go home. By Wednesday night, everyone was moving around in a daze. Lana Mollere, the restaurant's general manager, moved here from New Orleans six months ago. Her four older sisters and mother fled to Baton Rouge. ''They lost everything,'' Ms. Mollere said, her eyes glassy with tears. At a corner table, Ashli Rosenthal and Kim Meyer, 24-year-old graduates of Tulane University, huddled with Mr. Goldman to hastily plan a benefit for the New Orleans rescue effort. They scribbled ideas in their notebooks: Dixieland band. Auction. Red Cross. ''I have such an absurd love for that city,'' Ms. Rosenthal said. ''I haven't been able to sleep since Sunday night.'' The women traded bits of news about some of New Orleans' best-known characters. Eddie, the plate player from the Ninth Ward, was said to be missing. There was no word from Frenchy, a performer who painted swirling canvases. As for Jacques-Imo's Cafe in New Orleans, Mr. Goldman shook his head glumly. He had heard that the whimsical local landmark, in the Uptown New Orleans area, was flooded with two to three feet of water. Of the 85 employees of Jacques-Imo's Cafe and its sister restaurant in New Orleans, Crabby Jack's, only a handful had been heard from. Mr. Goldman was already searching for rental apartments in New York so members of the kitchen staff could work at his restaurant temporarily. Jacques Leonardi, the gregarious proprietor and namesake of the New Orleans restaurant, arrived in New York on Thursday. As he told Mr. Goldman over the phone, ''I think we're going to move the ship to New York for a couple months.'' New Orleans expatriates kept streaming into the Columbus Avenue restaurant. Sarah Hanson, Claire Meunier and Rachal Bourgeois, in summery tank tops and shiny earrings, sipped glasses of brandy milk punch and Cajun martinis and tried to soothe the pain they felt for their beloved hometown. ''I think it will all come back,'' Ms. Hanson said softly. ''I'm just thankful we can remember how New Orleans was before.'' Then she cast a glance at the latest news on a television set above the bar and sighed. ''I need another drink.'' JENNIFER BLEYER Urban Studies"
"Michael Chertoff, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, gave his most detailed explanation to date for the troubled federal response to Hurricane Katrina on Saturday, saying the storm was particularly unpredictable and that the government had not expected large sections of the levees protecting New Orleans to fail. Mr. Chertoff also expressed confidence in Michael D. Brown, a Homeland Security undersecretary and the Federal Emergency Management Agency director, who has coordinated federal efforts at the scene. Mr. Brown has come under fire from critics of the federal government's hurricane response, who describe him as a political appointee who had no disaster experience before joining FEMA. Though he once worked as a municipal official in Edmond, Okla., Mr. Brown's major previous job was as commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association, from which he resigned under pressure in 2001 after a controversial 10 years. Speaking at a press briefing here, Mr. Chertoff said planners had anticipated that water would rise above the levees containing Lake Pontchartrain, but that the levees would not be breached. ''We didn't merely have the overflow,'' he said. ''We actually had the break in the wall. And I will tell you that really that perfect storm of combination of catastrophes exceeded the foresight of the planners and maybe anybody's foresight.'' The domestic security chief said the probability that the storm would hit New Orleans increased last Saturday, giving relatively little time to prepare before it made landfall on Monday. ''The way these catastrophes unfolded is unprecedented in anybody's experience,'' he said, comparing the disaster at one point to the dropping of an atomic bomb. ''Nature was unhelpful'' in terms of giving sufficient warning, he said. He said the experience with the hurricane had persuaded him to ''break the traditional model'' for disaster response, in which the federal government offers ''merely a support role.'' Asked whether Mr. Brown should be dismissed, Mr. Chertoff said, ''I do have confidence in the FEMA director, and I have confidence in the people who are working tirelessly for him.'' But emergency management experts were skeptical of the explanations. One of them, Jerome M. Hauer, a former top emergency management official for New York City and the Department of Health and Human Services, said, ''In a city like New Orleans, where they had been talking for some time about the levee system not holding, why did they not expect the possibility of a levee break?'' Mr. Hauer said, ''At the end of the day, FEMA was not ready for this.'' Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Brown have borne the brunt of criticism of delays and confusion in the federal effort in New Orleans. Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, called on President Bush on Friday to dismiss one or both of them. Instead, Mr. Bush publicly praised Mr. Brown on Friday, saying he had done ''a heck of a job.'' Mr. Hauer said FEMA was ''struggling,'' in part because of Mr. Brown's lack of experience. ''Every time we have had a FEMA director who has come out of a political environment rather than an emergency environment, FEMA has struggled,'' he said. Mr. Brown, a lawyer who is active in the Oklahoma Republican Party, was brought to the emergency management agency as general counsel by President Bush's first FEMA director, Joe M. Allbaugh, who ran Mr. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. STORM AND CRISIS: EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT"
"After a week of watching her city descend into chaos and despair -- after seeing the unbelievable images of the city's poorest and most vulnerable citizens struggling to survive -- Cheryl Bratt said she could not care less about what she may have left behind and lost. Like others who have arrived in New York, Ms. Bratt, who left New Orleans hours before Hurricane Katrina hit, is simply struggling to make sense of why she was so fortunate while so many others were not. ''I have been crying for days,'' she said yesterday. Ms. Bratt, 26, arrived in New Orleans four years ago as a Teach for America corps member and decided to stay after falling in love with the city and its people. She also developed strong ties with some of her students, many of them born into poverty. Since reaching the comfort of her mother's home in Yorktown Heights in Westchester County, Ms. Bratt said, she has spent her waking hours trolling for information about friends and former students. States across the country have been stepping up to announce their willingness to take in students and others displaced by the storm, and New York has joined them. Gov. George E. Pataki announced yesterday that New York would welcome students in all grades and would also offer state-resident tuition rates at the state's colleges for displaced students. Outside the public overtures, many New Yorkers are privately welcoming friends and family who have escaped from all parts of the Gulf Coast. But interviews with many evacuees from New Orleans suggest that their relief at being alive is tinged with a mix of guilt and confusion about why so many of their fellow citizens did not receive the help they needed to get out. Jeffrey Presley, 27, who left New York on Aug. 10 to start law school at Tulane University, managed to flee New Orleans early. And while feeling relieved, he, too, struggled with the glaring disparity between those with the means to escape and those trapped in a living Bruegel painting. He said that as he and a friend drove out of town, even before the storm hit, they thought about those left behind. On the radio they kept hearing the same message: Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate. It seemed like a command that few could possibly obey. ''We were sitting there and thinking that New Orleans is a city where most of the residents are reliant on public transportation,'' Mr. Presley said. ''It was a sickening feeling thinking all these people are going to die unless they get them out.'' Mr. Presley, who flew to New York last week after driving to Houston, said he still cannot make sense of the disaster. ''We all feel haunted by the entire situation,'' said Mr. Presley, who has already enrolled for classes at Brooklyn Law School and now lives in Williamsburg. ''We were able to leave, and we worried about getting out and going to law school, but we're so much better off than so many other people.'' At Tulane, Kimberly Cernak, 20, used to tutor low-income public school students. She said that during the flooding, poverty -- as well as age and infirmity -- became a dividing line in New Orleans. ''I've been thinking about those kids and their families and wishing there was some way I could know they're O.K.,'' said Ms. Cernak, who came to live with her grandparents in Staten Island and plans to complete her senior year at Columbia University, which is accepting some students displaced by the hurricane. ''It shows you there's a lot we still need to do as a country to make sure that in times like these everyone can get out,'' she said. ''No matter how much money you have, no matter how many cars you have.'' Ms. Cernak, who left New Orleans on Aug. 27, said it was difficult to begin the school year thinking about the chaos she left in her wake. ''At this point,'' she said, ''I can't wait for the flood waters to recede, but I have to finish my academic career.'' She said she had called the local Red Cross in New York City to volunteer, but that she still felt a sense of helplessness. ''It has been really frustrating and really overwhelming,'' she said. Tom Thayer, 39, a partner in a French Quarter bar called d.b.a, said he left New Orleans before the storm only because he did not want to be without air-conditioning for a few days. Since the flooding, he has received cellphone text messages from friends who stayed behind. They described defending their homes with guns against looters, an image that continues to keep him awake at night. ''All I have dreamed about was these people being in boats, getting shot at,'' he said. Mr. Thayer, who used to live in New York City and is staying at a friend's apartment on the Upper West Side, said that many of his employees were struggling musicians. The recovery effort, he said, would probably have been carried out better if the victims had not been poor. Ms. Bratt agreed. ''As a teacher, the motto is supposed to be 'Leave no child behind,''' she said. ''We ended up leaving too many children behind.'' She considers herself fortunate to be safe in New York, but Ms. Bratt says she cannot help but cry when she reads the text message sent to her yesterday morning by a former student from New Orleans, Quiana. A 16-year-old, Quiana is now stranded in Baton Rouge and faces the prospect of leaving her mother to attend school in California, where her grandmother lives. ''All my uncles on my daddy's side are still there,'' Quiana wrote. ''And nobody has heard from them.''"
"Sleep did not come easily to the orphans of the storm. Deep into the wee hours of Saturday, five days after they had lost their homes and all their possessions to the ravages of Hurricane Katrina, thousands of exhausted evacuees from New Orleans bused to the Astrodome here lay on green cots staring numbly, playing cards, reading the Bible or aimlessly pacing the vast arena, as if after all the sleepless nights they had forgotten how to sleep. Or maybe it was the stark stadium lighting that dimmed but never quite faded to dark. Some milled with a purpose, seeking rides to Austin or news of the missing with cardboard signs in grim shorthand. ''Blanca Ducree.'' ''Jinfeng.'' High above the crowd in the 62,000-seat arena, which could swallow an 18-story building, electronic signs that in happier days flashed baseball and football scores were only slightly more elaborate: ''Donsha looking for Billy Parker.'' Well after midnight, high time for an 8-year-old in braids to be tucked into bed, Yolanda Paul circled the Astrodome hoping to find lost relatives, including her daddy, Larry Paul. ''In my heart, I believe they got out,'' said her mother, Rainee Grant, who had driven in from St. Louis with Yolanda and her baby sister to search the shelters, so far in vain. In contrast with the mayhem in the New Orleans convention center and the squalor of the Superdome that many evacuees evoked with horror, the Astrodome radiated security and services. Dozens of Houston police officers patrolled the floor and concourses. There were a few arrests for fights but nothing worse, the officers said. A clinic staffed by dozens of volunteer doctors and nurses from Houston's huge medical establishment dispensed medication and treated a range of ailments and needs that included rashes and infections from contaminated floodwaters, seizures, dehydration, dialysis, chest pains, drug and alcohol withdrawal and psychiatric disorders. There were 85 showers and hundreds of toilets. The entire fourth tier was given over to hot food service -- beef tips and Cajun rice on Friday night -- augmented by boxes of apples and bags of baby carrots available throughout the night. The telephone company SBC set up dozens of phones for free long-distance calls. Legions of volunteers roamed the aisles and concourses mopping floors, emptying trash bins and handing out clothing, diapers, toys, water, juice, soft drinks and snacks. Some gestures seemed even more generous than others. Bob Chrane, a Houston lawyer, posted his calling card and telephone numbers with the offer: ''take 1 wheelchair + 1 attendant; smoker and dog O.K.'' Karen Wakefield, a volunteer for the Red Cross, handed Henry Becker, a contractor who had escaped the flood with a neighbor, some stomach medication but had disappointing news on his request for reading glasses. ''I looked high and low and couldn't find any,'' she said. Gloria Brown, minister of the House of Joy Fellowship in Houston with, she said, a diploma in clowning, walked among the cots handing out plastic crucifixes and promising to return, if officials approved, with her clown act to cheer up the crowd. Shawande Graps, 25, and two other mothers evacuated from New Orleans with 10 children among them were on cots on an upstairs tier when Martha Hicks, 24, a volunteer majoring in criminal justice at Sam Houston State University, passed by with a carton of clothes. ''You like Spider-Man?'' she asked Ms. Graps's son, Shondell, 3. He nodded gravely. Ms. Hicks pulled out a Spider-Man T-shirt and handed it to him. Ms. Graps seemed overwhelmed. ''When we were home, he watched Spider-Man all day,'' she said. ''I just thank the Lord. This is a nice spot to go to sleep.'' Mayor Bill White and other Houston officials who vowed Friday to throw open the city's arms to the victims of Hurricane Katrina said that the Astrodome, which pioneered the domed stadium in 1965 but had lost its teams to more modern arenas, could shelter as many as 18,000 storm survivors. But with other emergency centers opening up at the newer Reliant Park next door and the George R. Brown Convention Center downtown, considerably fewer than that bedded down in the Astrodome on Friday night. Still, the green concrete arena floor was chockablock with cots, and several hundred people who gave up waiting for more cots to arrive ended up sleeping in the padded red seats. That led to some grumbling. Robin Gail Petit, 51, who is diabetic and takes nine medicines, fell on some steps, which required a trip to a Houston hospital. When she got back several hours later, she said, someone had taken her cot. She timidly repossessed it, hoping the new claimant would not return. But many of the visitors seemed too absorbed in the grim circumstances to complain. Covil Joseph, 58, a video director wearing a castoff T-shirt, said that he and his sister and their 81-year-old mother in a wheelchair had been plucked from their house by a boatman, then were refused refuge by a hospital and spent seven hours tied to a bridge while being lashed by the storm. They were rescued but he said he had no idea where his mother and sister were taken. Chanelle Jones, 31, with three boys and a girl and four months pregnant, said her back was so hurt from sleeping on the ground that she had trouble standing. Her husband, a temporary worker, had barely been able to support the family before the storm. ''I lost everything I ever worked for,'' Ms. Jones said through tears. ''All my children's clothes, their birth certificates, everything -- everything is gone except us. ''My children are always asking me: 'Why are you crying?''' Ivory Joyce, 62, who had worked for the city on a garbage truck, said he was missing important medicine. ''I'm a suicide patient,'' he said. ''I've talked to a psychiatrist.'' Arthur Mack, 64, tried to read ''Death Squadron,'' a World War II novel, but it appeared to have been in a war zone of its own, pages falling apart as he turned them. Cecile Conway, 44, who swam to safety but lost track of family members, sat reading the Bible, marking Psalm 6 with green pencil for emphasis: ''O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger, nor chastise me in Your hot displeasure. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak. O Lord, heal me for my bones are troubled.'' Yong Han, a doctor at Texas Children's Hospital who volunteered at the clinic after a full shift at work, said a woman unable to locate her family members had been left to care for 11 grandchildren. And, he said, two women in the shelter, unable to cope with their stress, had given up their children to foster care. ''I do missionary work in the poorest part of Mexico,'' Dr. Han said, ''but I got to tell you, this is pretty bad.'' As in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, some of the most poignant testimonies were those pinned to a message wall and taped to surfaces throughout the arena. ''Kentrell Hyams and Shawntrel Hyams,'' read one anguished appeal, ''I'm looking for y'all. I'm staying at Reliant Arena. Your mom, Cheryl. I love y'all. I'm staying on cot. I have cot ready for y'all all the way in back.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE SCENE"
"The broad American economy has largely withstood the early effects of Hurricane Katrina, even as residents of the Gulf Coast suffer through a regional economic disaster with few equals. The flooding has displaced about one million workers in the Gulf Coast region, many of whom will not be able to resume their jobs anytime soon. While some employees of large companies are still receiving paychecks, Wal-Mart stopped paying workers in the area four days after shutting its stores, and McDonald's and UPS have not paid regular wages to idled employees since the storm hit. The hurricane has also bottled up grain shipments on the Mississippi River, hurting farmers and grain exporters, and saddled households with even higher energy costs. The effect of the damage to oil rigs and refineries in the gulf is the greatest uncertainty. But contrary to early fears, the nation's transportation network has not become overwhelmed so far, and despite spot shortages drivers have generally been able to buy gasoline. The price of crude oil fell 2 percent on Friday -- to $67.57, up only $1 from a week ago -- as a large importing terminal off the coast of Louisiana reopened and the International Energy Agency announced that it would release emergency oil supplies. As corporate executives scrambled to get in touch with employees who lived in Katrina's path, most said they had seen little overall effect on their businesses. ''It's a little too early to tell,'' said Fred Beljaars, an executive vice president of DHL, the shipping company. ''But the first indications are that there is no real impact on trade.'' Apple Computer, Intel and National Semiconductor all reported that their operations were running normally. So did Harley-Davidson and Whirlpool. Nissan halted production Monday morning at a plant in Canton, Miss., that builds Titan pickup trucks, but reopened it Wednesday. Economists said that the storm and its aftermath had raised the risks of a downturn. One major question is whether the damage to oil refineries aggravates what had already been a growing burden caused by soaring energy prices. No forecaster knows how consumers will react to seeing gas lines reminiscent of the 1970's and hearing the president urge people to drive less. If oil production or refining does not return to pre-storm levels for months, a spike in energy prices could prompt households to cut their spending and cause other hardships. ''The difference with this disaster is that we have an energy shock,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. But the most likely outcome, according to forecasts that Wall Street firms revised after the storm, is a slowdown in growth during the rest of this year and a pickup next year, as New Orleans and southern Mississippi are rebuilt. ''Clearly, this will be a challenging time for the economy,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said on Friday after meeting with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to discuss the storm's impact. But, Mr. Snow said, ''The normal pattern is that after the negative consequences, we get into a rebuilding mode, and that rebuilding mode takes you to higher G.D.P. levels.'' In a sign that the recovery could make the sprawling construction sector even busier than it has been during the recent housing boom, the price of lumber jumped last week. ''Personally, I'm loading up on everything,'' said Bruce Scanlon, manager of Boulder Lumber, a Colorado store that sells the bulk of its supplies to building contractors. ''No one is taking any chances.'' The fast economic recovery from the Sept. 11 attacks showed that traumatic events often have a relatively small economic impact. On the day of the attacks, the economy had been shrinking for about six months; it was growing again by the end of the year, at least outside of the New York area. There is a major difference this year, however: the Fed and the Bush Administration have less in their arsenal to fight economic weakness today than they did in 2001. A soaring budget deficit makes it harder for the White House to propose tax cuts than it was four years ago. Mr. Snow dismissed suggestions last week from the House Republican whip, Roy Blunt of Missouri, that Congress take up a stimulus package that goes beyond money for reconstruction. And the Fed has been raising its benchmark interest rate since the start of last year to ward off inflation, a policy that Anthony M. Santomero, president of the Philadelphia Fed, said last week would probably continue. But Katrina complicates the Fed's job. ''The problem, and every Fed official is fully aware of this, is that every recession since 1971 has been preceded by two things: higher oil prices and an increasing Federal funds rate,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research. If Katrina leads to a sustained increase in oil prices, Mr. Yamarone said, the Fed could have to ''navigate between skyrocketing prices and stagnating economic growth.'' Consumers also have less of a cushion than they have had at many other points. In July, the nation's savings rate fell below zero, to its lowest level on record, the Commerce Department said last week, suggesting that households have little ability to absorb higher oil prices without cutting other spending. But the forces supporting growth might be just as strong. Katrina's aftermath caused a fall in long-term interest rates, potentially prolonging the housing boom, which has been showing signs of slowing. Americans have also been unwilling to change their driving habits, despite oil prices that had doubled between early 2004 and last month. ''You still have to get from Point A to Point B,'' said Paul Noonan, a 41-year-old engineer from Boston, while stopped at a rest stop in upstate New York on his way to Minnesota last week. People talk about traveling less, Mr. Noonan said, but he did not think they were really doing so. But the economy has been growing at a healthy clip in recent weeks, and few forecasters think it is close to tipping into recession. ''Fortunately, this happened in a strong economy,'' said Henry A. McKinnell Jr., chief executive of Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of chief executives. ''But I don't think anyone would say it will be positive.'' Even if the economic impact ends up being narrow, the storm has still created a challenge unlike any other the country has faced recently. A local economy that employed a million people has suddenly shut down. Some of those people have been able to continue working elsewhere. Of the several thousand Wal-Mart employees from the 36 stores that were still closed on Friday morning, four have relocated to Pensacola, Fla., and are working for the company there, said Melissa O'Brien, a spokeswoman. Wal-Mart is also giving emergency grants, typically of about $250, to some employees. UPS is helping Gulf Coast workers put in for holiday time or unused vacation so they could continue to be paid, said Norman Black, a company spokesman. Walt Riker, a McDonald's spokesman, said the chain was trying to locate workers and considering ways to help them financially. DHL, Pfizer and Starbucks all said they were continuing to pay employees who were unable to work because stores and offices were flooded or destroyed. Other people -- many employees of small businesses, for example -- were not so fortunate. At a church shelter in Houston, Paula Sanchez, 52, slowly cried as she said she was trying to locate her 24-year-old daughter. Ms. Sanchez, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who worked as a pipe insulator at Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans, also wondered whether she could start over in Texas. ''I hear there is industry here,'' she said. ''I hope there's something here for me. I'm ready to do almost anything.'' The recovery in New Orleans is likely to take longer than it will in southern Mississippi, where there is much less flooding. About 600,000 of the region's 1 million workers are in New Orleans, according to Economy.com, a research company. Outside the immediate area, the biggest economic problems have come along the Mississippi River corridor. The Port of New Orleans is the nation's fifth busiest, and its closure has left barges in the Midwest with nowhere to go. River/Gulf Grain, a shipping company in Davenport, Iowa, sent only one barge of corn and soybeans down the Mississippi last week and planned to send none next week, compared with the four or five it usually sends this time of year, said Erol R. Melik, the company's president. With no way to get the corn and beans on their way to Asia, the company would not hire the extra four workers that it did last year during harvest season. ''We're just taxing our infrastructure in a way we could never envision,'' Mr. Melik said. ''It's going to be a quagmire for a long time.'' Manufacturers have been calling ports from Houston to Philadelphia to ask about their ability to accept steel, rubber and other goods that usually go to New Orleans. On Thursday in Houston, stevedores finished unloading 3,000 tons of rubber and timber from the Indotrans Flores, a freighter diverted from New Orleans and Pascagoula, Miss., after the shipping lanes there had closed. ''There are alternatives,'' Donald C. McCrory, executive director of Port of Memphis, said. Still, the other ports will not be able to handle all of the New Orleans traffic easily, and many companies expect weeks of bottlenecks. The potential that those bottlenecks might worsen is one of the new risks facing the economy. No matter how the hurricane had affected them, people outside the disaster zone said financial issues were not their biggest concern. ''We're not feeling sorry for ourselves,'' said Mr. Melik of River/Gulf Grain. The human tragedy of the storm was far bigger than any economic problems, he said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE ECONOMY Correction: September 8, 2005, Thursday An article on Sunday about the economic effects of Hurricane Katrina referred incorrectly to the wages of idled workers at McDonald's, because of misinformation supplied by the company. McDonald's continued to pay the workers; it did not stop paying them after the storm hit."
"THEY say that misery loves company, but it's not exactly true. Misery loves the right sort of company. You had to look a little Thursday afternoon to find that truth, but it was there, like a sharp thorn in the rosy prayers and speeches on behalf of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, offered up by men and women who had lost someone on 9/11. A baker's dozen of them -- stoic mothers, strident sisters and a sad, insomniac uncle -- had come out for a while to stand by the bays of Ladder Company 10 on Liberty Street in Lower Manhattan to give their thoughts and hearts to those whose lives the storm had washed away. ''It's not an exclusive club, the suffering club,'' said William Healey, a tall, white-haired man with a look of lasting grief, whose niece, Renee Newell, a 37-year-old American Airlines employee, died when the towers were attacked. ''We feel their pain.'' With all due respect, Mr. Healey may be only half right. The club that he belongs to is an exclusive club. There is suffering, and there is suffering. There is private pain, and then there is the sort of pain that suddenly goes public, that is broadcast to the nation. Perhaps only members of that club can truly feel each other's pain. It's a select group. The 9/11 families belong to it, of course, as do those who lost a loved one in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Now the victims of Katrina, too, belong. That's why Diane Horning came from Scotch Plains, N.J., to stand outside that firehouse across the street from a hole in the ground. Ms. Horning lost her son, Matthew, 26, in 2 World Trade Center on 9/11. She wanted to let the good folks of New Orleans know that she understands. ''My heart is broken in two for those people,'' Ms. Horning said in a way that the rest of us outside the club might never understand. She has been through the shock, the grief, the numbness and then the queasy sense that after the world got hold of it, her pain was not her own. ''You're often asked to wear a mask,'' she said of those whose suffering becomes a national event. Sometimes it's the mask of bravery. Sometimes it's a mask of stoicism. Sometimes it's just a steely smile. ''I wouldn't presume to give them advice,'' Ms. Horning said. ''But if I did, it would only be to be authentic. Be themselves.'' By her own admission, people who have suffered publicly are different from you and me, tougher to handle. Their grief has become a symbol of survival and resolve. They are forced by caring strangers to remember, but what they often want is to forget. ''How do you get over something if you're constantly barraged by images of what you're trying to escape?'' Ms. Horning's husband, Kurt, asked. After all, the public often says: Don't forget. Don't forget the towers falling down. Don't forget the levees breaking open. But the person who went through those things will often say: Don't make me go through it again. Don't remind me anymore. The vigil on Liberty Street was organized by the Rev. Bill Minson, who has counseled 9/11 families for the last four years. Before that, he worked with residents of Oklahoma City. THIS day, he told a story. Several months ago, the Oklahomans came to town for a joint memorial service with the 9/11 families. When the Oklahomans were announced, he said, you could sense the silent recognition in the crowd: ''It was like people were finally saying, 'Somebody here really understands.''' New Orleans, like New York, will rise again, the reverend said. A sister told the cameras that her firefighter brother died in the towers that day in the service of his country. A father told about the blood drive he had started in memory of his son. A mother told the people of New Orleans that the people of New York were indebted to them. ''New York will always stand behind its fellow Americans,'' she said, ''because New York will not forget what its fellow Americans did for us.'' New York will not forget. History lives most vividly, after all, in the minds and memories of those who suffered through it. It will, no doubt, be the same in New Orleans and in Biloxi, Miss., and up and down the Gulf Coast.

"The pace of evacuations in New Orleans picked up markedly yesterday, and President Bush said that he had ordered 7,000 additional troops to the city and the Gulf Coast states to crack down on lawlessness and to evacuate thousands of refugees. Most of the hurricane survivors have been cleared from the New Orleans Superdome and the convention center, where they huddled in squalor and chaos for days. At least 19,000 have been reported evacuated from the area, with thousands bused to Texas. Caravans of buses that for thousands meant deliverance from danger, hunger and misery were finally rolling in, and thousands more, including 100 New York City buses accompanied by New York police officers, were on the way. But new problems are beginning to emerge. More than 220,000 hurricane refugees are already in Texas and thousands more are coming. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said yesterday that local officials were reporting ''they are quickly approaching capacity in the number of evacuees they believe they can assist.'' With the stranded still being brought out of New Orleans on stretchers and by air, bus and train, the president acknowledged again yesterday that his administration had failed to help many of the hurricane's most desperate victims promptly and promised to resurrect New Orleans and devastated coastal areas of several states. ''I know that those of you who have been hit hard by Katrina are suffering,'' Mr. Bush declared hours after signing a $10.5 billion package of assistance for the stricken region, which he called a down payment on aid to come. ''Many are angry and desperate for help. The tasks before us are enormous, but so is the heart of America. In America, we do not abandon our fellow citizens in our hour of need. And the federal government will do its part.'' While the number of dead is unknown, expanded search and rescue effort brought new glimpses of the likely death toll, with bodies set out in makeshift morgues, abandoned on roads or floating in canals. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said she expected the death toll to reach thousands. Rear Adm. W. Craig Vanderwagen of the federal Public Health Service said just one morgue, at a St. Gabriel prison, was expecting as many as to 2,000 bodies. The authorities told of a huge toll in Chalmette, a small community east of New Orleans, where 31 bodies were found in a nursing home and hundreds more residents were missing. The refugee emergency is beginning to affect neighboring states, Texas most of all. About 18,500 refugees were in the Houston Astrodome and an adjacent building, amid reports that it was at capacity. More than 120,000 refugees were in 97 shelters in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and other cities, according to Governor Perry's office, with an additional 100,000 in hotels and motels. The American Red Cross reported Saturday night that it was housing more than 96,000 refugees in nine states. Louisiana had more than 51,000 refugees in 127 Red Cross shelters; Mississippi had more than 13,000 in 102 shelters; and Alabama had nearly 4,000 in 47 shelters. Hundreds of newly arrived National Guard troops patrolled the lawless streets of New Orleans yesterday, beginning the task of wresting control from thugs and looters and restoring order in a city that had all but surrendered to death and disorder after Hurricane Katrina. Their numbers were unknown, but the head of the city's emergency services said there were only about a thousand, far fewer than needed. The deployment of the troops, the arrival of major convoys of desperately needed supplies, the speeded evacuation of tens of thousands of people from refugee centers and hospitals, and progress in closing some of the breached levees brought glimmers of hope for the flooded and ravaged city. The Army Corps of Engineers said crews had closed a 300-foot gap in the 17th Street Canal levee, where the heaviest floodwaters had entered the city, and said they expected to close a second gap in another canal over the weekend. But Brig. Gen. Robert Crear said it might take months to remove all the floodwaters from the swamped city. ''We're looking at anywhere from 36 to 80 days to being done,'' he said. Some federal officials, including Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, planned an immediate trip to the region and President Bush scheduled another trip to Louisiana for Monday. Officials continued to explain their initial slow response. At a news conference, Mr. Chertoff called the hurricane and subsequent flooding, an ''ultra-catastrophe'' that exceeded the foresight of planners. Asked what the government's response signified about the nation's preparedness for a potential terrorist attack, Mr. Chertoff said, ''If an ultra-catastrophe occurs, there's going to be some harmful fallout.'' Mr. Chertoff said the war in Iraq was not hurting the Guard's ability to respond to domestic catastrophe. He said the issue was not numbers, but logistics. ''These are citizen soldiers, we have to get them mobilized and deployed,'' he said. While thousands of refugees were evacuated from the New Orleans convention center, chaos continued at the airport, thousands were still trapped in homes and hotels, fires raged virtually unchecked in parts of the city, the power was out, and vast sections were still under water. Those who were newly rescued came with tales of endurance and loss. Waiting for evacuation at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, Kevin Davis, 34, said he had been stranded on a bridge since Tuesday with 30 others. When a helicopter sought Friday to extricate his wife, Donies, she slipped out of the harness and fell back to the bridge where she was unconscious and bleeding, he said. Another helicopter took her away a half hour later but left Mr. Davis behind. ''Nobody can tell me anything about my wife,'' he said, as he waited to be flown out of New Orleans. On streets where gun battles, fistfights, holdups, carjackings and marauding mobs of looters had held sway through the week, the mere sight of troops in camouflage battle gear and with assault rifles gave a sense of relief to many of the thousands of stranded survivors who had endured days of appalling terror and suffering. ''They brought a sense of order and peace, and it was a beautiful sight to see that we're ramping up,'' Governor Blanco said. ''We are seeing a show of force. It's putting confidence back in our hearts and in the minds of our people. We're going to make it through.'' Still officials cautioned that New Orleans faced a long, difficult climb out of the crisis. Six days after the hurricane decimated the Gulf Coast in a fantasia of howling winds and towering seas that weakened and then breached the city's protective levees, New Orleans was still a nightmarish town that had endured the unthinkable: 80 percent of its ground flooded, perhaps thousands of its citizens killed and numberless homes and businesses destroyed by water, fires, looters and scavengers. The shocking discovery of a large number of victims in Chalmette added a chilling new dimension to the scope of the disaster. While national attention has focused primarily on the tragedy of New Orleans, officials said almost no notice had been given to scores of outlying communities that were even more exposed to the storm's wrath -- towns isolated on the peninsulas of the bird's foot delta reaching into the Gulf of Mexico. At dawn yesterday, as a brilliant orange sun rose over the Mississippi, two huge columns of smoke climbed over the city as major fires burned unchecked, one apparently at the scene of an explosion that ripped through a propane gas storage warehouse on Friday, and another at a Saks Fifth Avenue store. Firefighters were handicapped by low water pressure and the difficulty of getting around the flooded city. There was no electricity in the city, and almost every office and store was closed. Bodies still floated in the floodwaters, and everywhere were signs of recent disorder: shattered storefronts, the detritus of looting that showed help had come too late. There was no water or food for sale, and no one had any idea how many people were still in New Orleans. A police officer making rescues in a boat said several people in homes five feet deep in water had turned him away, saying they had plenty of food, water and beer. The streets downtown were nearly deserted yesterday morning. Here and there, people pushed shopping carts, carried bags or dragged suitcases filled with their remaining possessions. Troops were on patrol outside City Hall, at the federal buildings, at refugee centers and at major intersections, and there were only glimpses of the hoodlums who had ruled unchecked for days. Superintendent P. Edward Compass III of the Police Department said 200 of the 1,500 officers on his force had walked off the job, citing the perils of fighting armed and menacing refugees, and he reported that two officers had committed suicide. While the sound of gunfire had been common in the streets of New Orleans for much of the week, it seemed to taper off. Michael D. Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said much of the earlier violence had been by youths with guns. ''Some of these kids think this is a game,'' he said. ''They somehow got their hands on a weapon. They think they are playing Pac-Man or something and shooting at people. Those kinds of hot spots will continue, but I can tell you they will learn very quickly the 82nd Airborne does not like to be shot at. This is not a game.'' The absence of any widespread disorder was only one of the positive signs. In addition to the arrival of hundreds of National Guard troops to the region, which coincided with President Bush's visit on Friday, there were other signs of hope. The evacuations of Tulane University and Charity Hospitals were completed, officials said, but three other hospitals remained open. The evacuation of the Louisiana Superdome, which had become a fetid shelter of last resort for 25,000 people, was all but completed, with many of its refugees taken to the Astrodome in Houston, 350 miles away. Progress was made in repairing breached levees that had allowed the waters of Lake Pontchartrain to flood the below-sea-level city. Three breaks occurred in canals that jut into New Orleans from the lakefront. The mouths of each of the canals have been closed, and engineers and contractors have begun to drain the canals to get at powerful pumps that will be used to clear water from the city. They also have begun to reconstruct the levee itself, driving piles into the 300-foot gap. Amtrak made its first run out of New Orleans since the hurricane, carrying 650 people to Dallas. Convoys of trucks carrying food, water and other relief supplies rolled into the city and were greeted by cheers and sobs of relief by some of the exhausted, traumatized refugees. Others, like 46-year-old Michael Levy, one of the refugees at the convention center, were bitter. ''They should have been here days ago,'' he said as others yelled in agreement. STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 6, 2005, Tuesday A front-page article on Sunday about rescue efforts after Hurricane Katrina misstated a word in a quotation from President Bush about the federal response to the crisis. He said, ''In America, we do not abandon our fellow citizens in their hour of need,'' not ''our hour of need.''"
"Reeling from the chaos of this overwhelmed city, at least 200 New Orleans police officers have walked away from their jobs and two have committed suicide, police officials said on Saturday. Some officers told their superiors they were leaving, police officials said. Others worked for a while and then stopped showing up. Still others, for reasons not always clear, never made it in after the storm. The absences come during a period of extraordinary stress for the New Orleans Police Department. For nearly a week, many of its 1,500 members have had to work around the clock, trying to cope with flooding, an overwhelming crush of refugees, looters and occasional snipers. P. Edwin Compass III, the superintendent of police, said most of his officers were staying at their posts. But in an unusual note of sympathy for a top police official, he said it was understandable that many were frustrated. He said morale was ''not very good.'' ''If I put you out on the street and made you get into gun battles all day with no place to urinate and no place to defecate, I don't think you would be too happy either,'' Mr. Compass said in an interview. ''Our vehicles can't get any gas. The water in the street is contaminated. My officers are walking around in wet shoes.'' Fire Department officials said they did not know of any firefighters who had quit. But they, too, were sympathetic to struggling emergency workers. W.J. Riley, the assistant superintendent of police, said there were about 1,200 officers on duty on Saturday. He said the department was not sure how many officers had decided to abandon their posts and how many simply could not get to work. Mr. Riley said some of the officers who left the force ''couldn't handle the pressure'' and were ''certainly not the people we need in this department.'' He said, ''The others are not here because they lost a spouse, or their family or their home was destroyed.'' Police officials did not identify the officers who took their lives, one on Saturday and the other the day before. But they said one had been a patrol officer, who a senior officer said ''was absolutely outstanding.'' The other was an aide to Mr. Compass. The superintendent said his aide had lost his home in the hurricane and had been unable to find his family. Because of the hurricane, many police officers and firefighters have been isolated and unable to report for duty. Others evacuated their families and have been unable to get back to New Orleans. Still, some officers simply appear to have given up. A Baton Rouge police officer said he had a friend on the New Orleans force who told him he threw his badge out a car window in disgust just after fleeing the city into neighboring Jefferson Parish as the hurricane approached. The Baton Rouge officer would not give his name, citing a department policy banning comments to the news media. The officer said he had also heard of an incident in which two men in a New Orleans police cruiser were stopped in Baton Rouge on suspicion of driving a stolen squad car. The men were, in fact, New Orleans officers who had ditched their uniforms and were trying to reach a town in north Louisiana, the officer said. ''They were doing everything to get out of New Orleans,'' he said. ''They didn't have the resources to do the job, or a plan, so they left.'' The result is an even heavier burden on those who are patrolling the street, rescuing flood victims and trying to fight fires with no running water, no electricity, no reliable telephones. Police and fire officials have been begging federal authorities for assistance and criticizing a lack of federal response for several days. ''We need help,'' said Charles Parent, the superintendent of the Fire Department. Mr. Parent again appealed in an interview on Saturday for replacement fire trucks and radio equipment from federal authorities. And Mr. Compass again appealed for more federal help. ''When I have officers committing suicide,'' Mr. Compass said, ''I think we've reached a point when I don't know what more it's going to take to get the attention of those in control of the response.'' The National Guard has come under criticism for not moving more quickly into New Orleans. Lt. Gen. H Steven Blum, the head of the National Guard Bureau, told reporters on Saturday that the Guard had not moved in sooner because it had not anticipated the collapse of civilian law enforcement. Some patrol officers said morale had been low on the force even before the hurricane. One patrolman said the complaints included understaffing and a lack of equipment. ''We have to use our own shotguns,'' said the patrolman, who did not want to be identified by name. ''This isn't theirs; this is my personal gun.'' Another patrol officer said that many of the officers who had quit were younger, inexperienced officers who were overwhelmed by the task. Some officers have expressed anger at colleagues who have stopped working. ''For all you cowards that are supposed to wear the badge,'' one officer said on Fox News, ''are you truly -- can you truly wear the badge, like our motto said?'' The Police and Fire Departments are being forced to triage the calls they get for help. The firefighters are simply not responding to some fires. In some cases, they cannot get through the flooding. But in others, they decide not to send trucks because they are needed for more serious fires. ''We can't fight every fire the way we did in the past and try to put it out,'' Superintendent Parent told a group of firefighters on Saturday morning at a promotion ceremony in the Algiers section of New Orleans, a dry area. Even facing much more work than could possibly be handled, he said, it was important for him to take time out for two promotion ceremonies. ''The men need reinforcement,'' said Mr. Parent, who put on his last clean uniform shirt for the ceremonies elevating 22 officers to the rank of captain. ''They need to see their leader and understand that the department is still here and not going to pot.'' STORM AND CRISIS: LAW ENFORCEMENT Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"Marty Montgomery stood on his second-floor balcony on Friday night, playing blues on his harmonica into empty French Quarter streets that have never seemed so dark, so desolate -- or so threatening. On the table beside him sat a shotgun that he calls kindness. ''If something happens and I have to use it, I'll be killing them with kindness,'' Mr. Montgomery said, laughing with a tinge of menace. Life is not so easy these days in the French Quarter, the district of all-night bars, historic homes and voodoo traditions that is the oldest, rowdiest and, these days, driest part of storm-battered New Orleans. Outside, the Quarter's elegant 150-year-old buildings look relatively unruffled, except for some loosened bricks, having been spared the worst of Hurricane Katrina's winds and sitting high enough to have avoided the flooding. Ceramic flowerpots on every other balcony seem not to have budged, gaslights still burn outside doors, Preservation Hall stands solidly intact, seemingly undamaged. But inside the gated buildings, the Quarter's few remaining residents feel under siege. Yet their lives go on. And because this is the French Quarter, they go on with a certain style. Inside Mr. Montgomery's building at 519 St. Philip Street, five small loft apartments built around a courtyard, 10 people have banded together with a blend of military precision and New Orleans panache to create an oasis of civility in a city with no running water, no electricity, a dwindling supply of food and a spreading sense of chaos. Every night they eat hot dinners, prepared over a barbecue grill and served with white wine: ravioli with ragout one day, crab cakes and andouille sausage on another. They have moved a yellow portable toilet from a nearby construction site to the curb outside, scrubbing it clean after every use. For baths, they have filled spray bottles with water and a hint of bleach. ''I'd rather have burned skin than die of illness,'' said Stephanie McCorkle, 42, a voodoo devotee who led tours of haunted houses in the Quarter before the storm. And all night, every night, Mr. Montgomery, a former sailor who waited tables before the storm, keeps watch over the block, his shotgun and harmonica to keep him company. Except for a tavern next door, a corner hotel where tarot card readers live and one house down the block, the street is empty. Indeed, the block is so quiet these days that Mr. Montgomery, 49, has discovered night sounds he did not know were there, before the music stopped: the croak of frogs, the chirp of crickets, the squeak of river rats. Now he listens to the frogs for warning signs: when they grow quiet, he knows people are approaching. Though 519's residents knew each other from working at a nearby restaurant, the Market Café, they were never particularly close -- indeed, Mr. Montgomery and the group's cook, John Tibbetts, barely spoke. Now, they do everything communally, down to sharing the dry sneakers, clean T-shirts, food and water they have taken from stores. They justify the looting as necessary to their survival. ''I'm not proud of it,'' Mr. Tibbetts, 50, said. ''But we do what we have to do.'' Mr. Montgomery, a tall, wiry, intense and commanding man who rarely wears a shirt these days, is tacitly accepted as the group's general, setting rules that govern personal hygiene, security and access by ''outsiders'' to their building. His reputation as an enforcer has gained him renown within the neighborhood. Friday evening, when looters broke into a liquor store around the corner, the manager came looking for Mr. Montgomery, who chased the looters off, shouting, ''If you come back, I'll waste you.'' Then he flagged down passing police officers, who briefly detained one looter, scolded him loudly and then released him. Unperturbed, Mr. Montgomery returned to the liquor store and helped board up the door. ''We call them the St. Philip's militia,'' said Dewanda Dey, the wife of the liquor store manager. There are signs of life elsewhere in the Quarter. At the corner of Bourbon and Orleans Streets, Johnny White's Sports Bar remained open during the storm -- and all day, every day, since. Early Saturday, three tipsy patrons sat at the elbow-worn bar under a ceiling featuring photographs of bar regulars. Five others stood in the street sipping warm drinks. To fight the city's gloom, its patrons plan to hold their own Decadence Day parade on Sunday to mark the annual gay Mardi Gras. ''There won't be feathered hats and tubas,'' said Joseph Bellomy, 24, a bartender. ''But we'll do the best we can.'' Watching over them all is Ride Hamilton, a firefighter who splits his time between Sioux Falls, S.D., and an apartment down the block from Johnny White's. Though he does not drink alcohol, he hangs out at the bar because he adores its clientele. Like a supply sergeant, Mr. Hamilton, 29, has stocked his apartment building with water, dry goods and bath products for him and his friends. Each morning, dressed in his blue firefighter's shirt, black leather pants and black boots, his right eyelid pierced with three silver hoops and his long hair pulled into a ponytail, he drives his Ford Escort to go ''shopping'' for more. At the stores, he sees looters with shopping carts who bid one another ''good morning.'' Like the residents of 519, he justifies his work as a necessary evil to help friends survive deprivation that could last months. ''Call it 'gathering supplies,''' he said. ''Just don't call it looting.'' Several residents of 519 hope to leave New Orleans as soon as friends or relatives can come pick them up. (None own cars.) But Mr. Montgomery says he will stay, confident that his beloved city, and particularly the French Quarter, will rebuild. ''Someday,'' he said, ''the lights will come back on. The music will start back up. And life will go on. And I'll have ice in my glass again.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ENCLAVES"
"Once the hard work of physical survival is complete, another kind of flood will begin, carrying with it remembered images of bloated bodies, rotting sewage and neighbors ragged with hunger, some turning desperate. Psychologists who study disasters say that the social anarchy, and the scale and duration of the watery assault on New Orleans and surrounding areas, will have an emotional impact that could last far beyond this hurricane season, and the next, for many residents. In addition to the initial shock and loss, the subsequent flooding has left tens of thousands of people with the profound sense of being trapped, stalked or helpless, in a kind of nightmare version of their own hometown. ''I don't know that we've seen anything like this,'' said Lee Clarke, a sociologist at Rutgers University and author of the forthcoming book ''Worst Cases,'' a history of disasters. ''It is outside our experience in some ways; the possibility that an entire modern city might be undone by a natural disaster.'' Over the years, researchers who have studied communities shattered by earthquakes, hurricanes, fires and tornadoes find that, in the months after the disaster strikes, most people recover from the mental shock, often by losing themselves in rebuilding and helping others. In the first six months after the disaster, some 80 percent have shaken off disabling feelings of sadness, grief or heightened fear. After a year, only about 3 percent to 5 percent suffer from the chronic irritability, recurring flashbacks of the disaster and hair-trigger panic over reminders of the ordeal that characterize post-traumatic stress disorder. ''The story of disaster recovery is ordinarily one of remarkable emotional resilience,'' said Charles Marmar, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco. But the floodwater did not bring the people of New Orleans together in the same way earthquakes or fires often do. It drove most of them out. And in the apparent absence of any functioning authority to coordinate security and rescue efforts, those left behind lapsed into a kind of corrosive social anarchy that will color their already painful memories with shame or horror, experts say. When caught in frightening situations without clear rules, most people look to others around them for guidance in how to behave, psychologists say. The rules that normally restrain people's actions -- ''Do not break into a store and steal a plasma TV,'' for example -- fall by the wayside when hundreds of other people are ignoring them. And in a variety of experiments, researchers have shown that a single leader can drive group behavior. ''That person may do something good, like rush to help in an emergency, and others follow,'' said Suzanne Yates, a psychologist at Lehman College in the Bronx. ''But if people start looting, and nothing happens to them, you get a kind of cascade, and a new norm of behavior is established, which makes it more crucial for those in authority to take some control.'' It does not take long for misdemeanors to become major crimes. ''Our experiments have shown that you can get people to commit immoral acts one step at a time,'' said Elliot Aronson, a psychologist at the University of California in Santa Cruz, in an e-mail message. ''People who would never dream of stealing a TV set might be inclined to do so if they first stole some water, bread, cereal, milk and so on.'' In an analysis of the 1977 blackout in New York City, researchers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute concluded that small-time criminals began the looting but that ''within two hours,'' the researchers wrote, ''it became apparent that the situation was not going to end quickly, and thousands of otherwise law-abiding citizens joined in what was to become the largest collective theft in history.'' In that situation, however, hunger, thirst and fear were not driving people to take the basic necessities of life, which was part of the situation in New Orleans. In the long recovery ahead for New Orleans, law-abiding residents who went beyond small acts of self-preservation to larger transgressions might have more than water damage to repair. ''We know from studies of soldiers that people who are perpetrators of what they consider to be atrocious acts need tremendous compassion from others to reclaim and re-own their humanity,'' Dr. Marmar said. In studies of several gulf parishes in the wake of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Jeanne Hurlbert, a sociologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and her colleagues found a clear link between people's mental health and the kinds of social relationships they had. Those in clans in which friends and family spend much of their time together reported fewer symptoms of depression in the weeks after the disaster than those who had looser networks, with friends in several social circles. ''But you're now looking a situation in which, when people return, they may have to find work,'' and more wide-ranging connections will be crucial, Dr. Hurlbert said. ''Both close ties and these extended relationships will be very important, and it's likely the people who have both who will do best.'' The ability of the city as a whole to recover is difficult to predict. Thousands of people in and around New Orleans have thrown themselves into the rescue effort. Private boat owners from up and down the coast have been helping to evacuate people, and people throughout the Gulf Coast region are working in emergency depots or providing floors for flood victims to sleep on. Yet underlying problems the city had before the disaster might frustrate the effort even of those most committed to help. The poverty rate in New Orleans is more than 40 percent, about three times the national rate, said Steve Kroll-Smith, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro who just moved from New Orleans after many years there. ''There are huge divisions by race and class in New Orleans, and everyone who lives there knows it,'' he said. ''The truth is that people living in the Garden District got out and those in the Ninth Ward and other poor neighborhoods didn't, and now this combination of rage and poverty is bubbling to the surface.'' In time perhaps the memory of this now-sodden city will be what brings together the evacuated and the abandoned, the well-off and the unlucky, in common purpose. Unlike a fire or earthquake, which reduce many buildings to rubble, a long period of flooding usually leaves many structures intact but uninhabitable, deeply familiar but permanently altered, like a loved one who is alive but unable to speak or interact, psychologists say. And there is an overpowering desire to make those buildings whole, to bring them back. Children in particular feel this loss deeply, experts say. They often look for a toy or a coloring book, something to provide a connection to their former life. After this flood, anything they find will be ruined, a confirmation of their current desperation. ''People don't know until something like this comes along how much the shape of their house, the texture of their house, the mood of their neighborhood, are important parts of who they are,'' said Kai Erikson, a sociologist at Yale. ''People take all of this so much for granted that when they return and the house is gone or not habitable it disorients them, makes them more lonely and more afraid, and they don't know why. ''This is true of public spaces and streets, too,'' Dr. Erikson continued. ''You have no idea how much they mean to you until they are gone or permanently altered.''

"Congress returns in full force on Tuesday to confront a legislative agenda turned on its head by the devastation resulting from Hurricane Katrina and a rise in gasoline prices accelerated by the storm. Leaders of both the House and Senate said initiatives to try to ease the blow of the hurricane on both the reeling Gulf Coast and across the nation would take precedence when Congress officially ended its five-week recess. A handful of lawmakers returned on Thursday and Friday to approve $10.5 billion in emergency money. ''We will raise the Katrina disaster as top priority for the House,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader. Mr. DeLay and other Congressional officials said the legislative proposals could be as narrowly tailored as a plan to allow Louisiana's federal courts to meet elsewhere and as sweeping as new legislation to rebuild battered oil refineries to bolster the nation's gasoline supplies. They see a monumental job ahead, with the need not only to reconstruct damaged infrastructure, but also to find ways to transport crops and commodities that typically move through New Orleans. A national economic stimulus bill is also possibile. ''Congress is going to have to look at all of these problems very carefully, and we've got to craft legislation that will fit this catastrophe,'' said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and a leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. ''This is going to be a lot of work.'' Committees in both houses are also scheduled to hold hearings into reasons and possible remedies for the rising cost of gasoline, a development that was stirring public complaints to lawmakers even before the storm sent prices soaring and left motorists idling in lines at gas stations for the first time in decades. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said that as part of the review, lawmakers would also explore whether oil companies were running up prices far beyond what could be justified by the supply problem. ''We want to make sure the whole gouging issue doesn't take off and we can maintain credible energy distribution throughout this country,'' Mr. Hastert said. The promise to revisit energy legislation comes only weeks after Congress broke a protracted stalemate and passed broad energy legislation that rejected efforts to curb oil consumption and dependence on foreign sources. ''This shows just how backward and meaningless the energy bill was,'' said Anna Aurilio, legislative director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which had argued that Congress use the bill to cut oil use. The new legislative agenda is a stark turn from what had been anticipated for fall. Before the hurricane, lawmakers and others had expected September to be consumed by Senate confirmation hearings for Judge John G. Roberts Jr., the first Supreme Court nominee in a decade. Those hearings are still scheduled to begin Tuesday, but much of Congress's attention will shift to the aftermath of the storm. The emphasis on the storm also carried a political undertone. Given strong criticism over the initial federal response in helping the stricken communities, members of Congress want to show they are doing their best to take the storm seriously, particularly with midterm elections coming next year. Both houses are planning investigations into what went wrong with the recovery effort. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is planning to start its inquiry as soon as Wednesday. Republicans, already facing questions about Iraq and the price of fuel, do not want to see the storm response develop into another divisive issue, and Mr. Hastert quickly backtracked from his comments questioning the wisdom of rebuilding New Orleans. But Senate Republicans indicated they might still proceed in the coming days with a proposal to repeal the estate tax, a plan that Democratic lawmakers said was inappropriate given the crisis in New Orleans and the adjacent region. ''I can't imagine there is a Democrat in the Senate who wants to do the estate tax, which affects a couple of thousand people when, as we speak, we have people still trapped in the convention center,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said. Mr. Reid noted that the two Democratic senators from Hawaii had already agreed to postpone scheduled action on a measure regarding Native Hawaiians, an important measure for their state. A spokeswoman for Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said that while any debate could be interrupted for hurricane-related issues, the Senate would continue to press ahead. ''We think it is important to let the nation know we can conduct business here,'' said the spokeswoman, Amy Call, who said the final agenda would be set once lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill. The need to deal with the storm's aftermath will take its toll on the legislative calendar and probably delay action on some major initiatives, like changes in immigration law, rules governing stem cell research and perhaps even the proposed overhaul of Social Security. Lawmakers also need to dispose of most of the annual spending measures and a pending military policy bill. They still plan to take up a budget measure that would extend some of President Bush's tax cuts while reducing future spending on health care for the poor and some education programs, proposals likely to encounter stiff resistance. Given the amount of potential business, Congressional leaders said they now expected that the session could extend until Thanksgiving. The session is officially scheduled to end on Sept. 30, but it is often extended a few weeks beyond. ''We will be hitting the ground running next Tuesday and be very active,'' Mr. DeLay said."
"THE white people got out. Most of them, anyway. If television and newspaper images can be deemed a statistical sample, it was mostly black people who were left behind. Poor black people, growing more hungry, sick and frightened by the hour as faraway officials counseled patience and warned that rescues take time. What a shocked world saw exposed in New Orleans last week wasn't just a broken levee. It was a cleavage of race and class, at once familiar and startlingly new, laid bare in a setting where they suddenly amounted to matters of life and death. Hydrology joined sociology throughout the story line, from the settling of the flood-prone city, where well-to-do white people lived on the high ground, to its frantic abandonment. The pictures of the suffering vied with reports of marauding, of gunshots fired at rescue vehicles and armed bands taking over the streets. The city of quaint eccentricity -- of King Cakes, Mardi Gras beads and nice neighbors named Tookie -- had taken a Conradian turn. In the middle of the delayed rescue, the New Orleans mayor, C.Ray Nagin, a local boy made good from a poor, black ward, burst into tears of frustration as he denounced slow moving federal officials and called for martial law. Even people who had spent a lifetime studying race and class found themselves slack-jawed. ''This is a pretty graphic illustration of who gets left behind in this society -- in a literal way,'' said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist glued to the televised images from his office at Harvard. Surprised to have found himself surprised, Mr. Jencks took to thinking out loud. ''Maybe it's just an in-the-face version of something I already knew,'' he said. ''All the people who don't get out, or don't have the resources, or don't believe the warning are African-American.'' ''It's not that it's at odds with the way I see American society,'' Mr. Jencks said. ''But it's at odds with the way I want to see American society.'' Last week it was how others saw American society, too, in images beamed across the globe. Were it not for the distinctive outlines of the Superdome, the pictures of hovering rescue helicopters might have carried a Somalian dateline. The Sri Lankan ambassador offered to help raise foreign aid. Anyone who knew New Orleans knew that danger lurked behind the festive front. Let the good times roll, the tourists on Bourbon Street were told. Yet in every season, someone who rolled a few blocks in the wrong direction wound up in the city morgue. Unusually poor ( 27.4 percent below the poverty line in 2000), disproportionately black (over two-thirds), the Big Easy is also disproportionately murderous -- with a rate that was for years among the country's highest. Once one of the most mixed societies, in recent decades, the city has become unusually segregated, and the white middle class is all but gone, moved north across Lake Pontchartrain or west to Jefferson Parish -- home of David Duke, the one-time Klansman who ran for governor in 1991 and won more than half of the state's white vote. Shortly after I arrived in town two decades ago as a fledgling reporter, I was dispatched to cover a cheerleading tryout, and I asked a grinning, half-drunk accountant where he was from, city or suburb. ''White people don't live in New Orleans,'' he answered with a where-have-you-been disdain. For those who loved it, its glories as well as its flaws, last week brought only heartbreak. So much of New Orleans, from its music and its food to its architecture, had shown a rainbow society at its best, even as everyone knew it was more complicated than that. ''New Orleans, first of all, is both in reality and in rhetoric an extraordinarily successful multicultural society,'' said Philip Carter, a developer and retired journalist whose roots in the city extend back more at least four generations. ''But is also a multicultural society riven by race and class, and all this has been exposed by these stormy days. The people of our community are pitted against each other across the barricades of race and class that six months from now may be last remaining levees in New Orleans.'' No one was immune, of course. With 80 percent of the city under water, tragedy swallowed the privilege and poor, and traveled spread across racial lines. But the divides in the city were evident in things as simple as access to a car. The 35 percent of black households that didn't have one, compared with just 15 percent among whites. ''The evacuation plan was really based on people driving out,'' said Craig E. Colten, a geologist at Louisiana State University and an expert on the city's vulnerable topography. ''They didn't have buses. They didn't have trains.'' As if to punctuate the divide, the water especially devastated the Ninth Ward, among city's poorest and lowest lying. ''Out West, there is a saying that water flows to money,'' Mr. Colten said. ''But in New Orleans, water flows away from money. Those with resources who control where the drainage goes have always chosen to live on the high ground. So the people in the low areas were hardest hit.'' Outrage grew as the week wore on, among black politicians who saw the tragedy as a reflection of a broader neglect of American cities, and in the blogosphere. ''The real reason no one is helping is because of the color of these people!'' wrote ''myfan88'' on the Flickr blog. ''This is Hotel Rwanda all over again.'' ''Is this what the pioneers of the civil rights movement fought to achieve, a society where many black people are as trapped and isolated by their poverty as they were by legal segregation laws?'' wrote Mark Naison, director of the urban studies program at Fordham, on another blog. One question that could not be answered last week was whether, put to a similar test, other cities would fracture along the same lines. AT one level, everything about New Orleans appears sui generis, not least its location below sea level. Many New Orleanians don't just accept the jokes about living in a Banana Republic. They spread them. But in a quieter catastrophe, the 1995 heat wave that killed hundreds of Chicagoans, blacks in comparable age groups as whites died at higher rates -- in part because they tended to live in greater social isolation, in depopulated parts of town. As in New Orleans, space intertwined with race. And the violence? Similarly shocking scenes had erupted in Los Angeles in 1992, after the acquittal of white police officers charged with beating a black man, Rodney King. Newark, Detroit, Washington --all burned in the race riots of the 1960's. It was for residents of any major city, watching the mayhem, to feel certain their community would be immune. With months still to go just to pump out the water that covers the city, no one can be sure how the social fault lines will rearrange. But with white flight a defining element of New Orleans in the recent past, there was already the fear in the air this week that the breached levee would leave a separated society further apart. ''Maybe we can build the levees back,'' said Mr. Carter. ''But that sense of extreme division by class and race is going to long survive the physical reconstruction of New Orleans.'' THE NATION: CAST AWAY"
"THEY were perhaps a bit slow, but the expressions of sympathy and offers of aid in the wake of Hurricane Katrina did materialize in Europe through the week. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany declared, '''Our American friends should know that we are standing by them.'' The French prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, offered to send supplies, two airplanes, 35 members of civil security rescue teams, and other equipment and personnel. Still, Europe's response so far to the calamity of Katrina has been complicated, even ambivalent. There was plenty of sympathy and willingness to help, but there was also, as with Mr. de Villepin's offer, a rather formulaic quality and an absence of any powerful, spontaneous surge of empathy and affection for the afflicted nation. Why? It is hard to measure this, but judging from the commentary and the blogs, the collective European response to the victims of the tsunami or the famine in Niger, to the killings in Darfur or the deaths of Shiite pilgrims in Baghdad seems to have been more immediate and deeply felt than for the victims of Katrina. And one reason for this relative coolness may be that these other disasters took place in poor, troubled nations, not in the most powerful and richest country on earth. In fact, the spectacle of the hurricane causing a disaster of third-world proportions in the United States seems to have provoked a sort of dismay among Europeans, mingling with the sorrow. As a reporter on BBC Television argued on Friday, not able to keep the anger from his voice, the looting, the armed gangs, the gunplay and, especially, the arrogance, in his view, that the mostly white police displayed toward mostly black residents represented ''the dark underbelly of life in this country.'' There was something shameful, he said, about the way a natural disaster has produced behavior that, for example, the tsunami didn't produce in the third-world countries it hit. And it is painful to be a witness to somebody else's shame. ''Why should hundreds die, mostly African-Americans, in a predicted disaster in the richest nation on earth'' was one expression of a widespread feeling in Europe, this one appearing Friday in a letter in the British newspaper The Guardian. There were many comments to the effect that earlier predictions of the disaster did not lead public officials to make sure the levees would withstand any possible onslaught, and there was the unspoken opinion that such would not have been the case, say, with the dikes of the Netherlands, or in any of the rich European countries. ''These are incredible scenes from the richest and the biggest country in the world,'' Jean-Pierre Pernaud, the anchorman on one of the main midday French news programs, said on Friday. A program on the competing channel ran an interview with a specialist on the United States, Nicole Bacharan, who said, ''These images reveal to the world the reality in the Southern states: the poverty of 37 million Americans.'' A few environmentalists in Europe seized on the situation to express one of their greatest irritations: the unwillingness of the Bush administration to sign the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. Jürgen Trittin, minister of the environment in Germany, was the most prominent among these, though others in Europe echoed this sentiment. ''The American president has closed his eyes to the economic and human damage that natural catastrophes such as Katrina -- in other words, disasters caused by a lack of climate protection measures -- can visit on his country,'' Mr. Trittin said. But Mr. Trittin's comment, which made headlines in Germany, provoked as much outrage as approval. ''Instead of standing by the Americans as they try to come to grips with the hurricane catastrophe, our environment minister Trittin shows the world the face of the ugly German,'' the mass circulation Bild Zeitung wrote Friday. A British commentator, Gerard Baker, called comments like those of Mr. Trittin and a few others examples of ''intellectual looting.'' It was, he said, ''the predictable exploitation of tragedy for political purposes.'' Still, Mr. Baker also went on to make the point that the real problem was the inherent inequality of suffering. ''The tragedy has been visited disproportionately, indeed almost exclusively, on the city's African-Americans,'' he wrote. There is no doubt most Europeans feel sorrow over the scenes of devastation they see on television, and many will no doubt contribute to funds set up to help the victims. At the same time, however, the particular circumstances of New Orleans and Biloxi, Miss., have tended to confirm the worst image of America that prevails in Europe, the vision of a country of staggering inequalities, indifference to the general welfare (especially during the Bush administration), and lacking in what Europeans call ''solidarity.'' As that BBC reporter put it, there were no scenes of armed gangs of looters in gun battles with the police in Sri Lanka after the tsunami. That things have gone so badly so quickly after the storm in New Orleans has produced, beyond sympathy, feelings in Europe of disappointment, distress and even fear that a major city in the world's superpower could have fallen into something that looks, from this side of the Atlantic, like anarchy. The Days After"
"AS the levees cracked open and ushered hell into New Orleans on Tuesday, President Bush once again chose to fly away from Washington, not toward it, while disaster struck. We can all enumerate the many differences between a natural catastrophe and a terrorist attack. But character doesn't change: it is immutable, and it is destiny. As always, the president's first priority, the one that sped him from Crawford toward California, was saving himself: he had to combat the flood of record-low poll numbers that was as uncontrollable as the surging of Lake Pontchartrain. It was time, therefore, for another disingenuous pep talk, in which he would exploit the cataclysm that defined his first term, 9/11, even at the price of failing to recognize the emerging fiasco likely to engulf Term2. After dispatching Katrina with a few sentences of sanctimonious boilerplate (''our hearts and prayers are with our fellow citizens''), he turned to his more important task. The war in Iraq is World War II. George W. Bush is F.D.R. And anyone who refuses to stay his course is soft on terrorism and guilty of a pre-9/11 ''mind-set of isolation and retreat.'' Yet even as Mr. Bush promised ''victory'' (a word used nine times in this speech on Tuesday), he was standing at the totemic scene of his failure. It was along this same San Diego coastline that he declared ''Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln more than two years ago. For this return engagement, The Washington Post reported, the president's stage managers made sure he was positioned so that another hulking aircraft carrier nearby would stay off-camera, lest anyone be reminded of that premature end of ''major combat operations.'' This administration would like us to forget a lot, starting with the simple fact that next Sunday is the fourth anniversary of the day we were attacked by Al Qaeda, not Iraq. Even before Katrina took command of the news, Sept. 11, 2005, was destined to be a half-forgotten occasion, distorted and sullied by a grotesquely inappropriate Pentagon-sponsored country music jamboree on the Mall. But hard as it is to reflect upon so much sorrow at once, we cannot allow ourselves to forget the real history surrounding 9/11; it is the Rosetta stone for what is happening now. If we are to pull ourselves out of the disasters of Katrina and Iraq alike, we must live in the real world, not the fantasyland of the administration's faith-based propaganda. Everything connects. Though history is supposed to occur first as tragedy, then as farce, even at this early stage we can see that tragedy is being repeated once more as tragedy. From the president's administration's inattention to threats before 9/11 to his disappearing act on the day itself to the reckless blundering in the ill-planned war of choice that was 9/11's bastard offspring, Katrina is déj_ vu with a vengeance. The president's declaration that ''I don't think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees'' has instantly achieved the notoriety of Condoleezza Rice's ''I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center.'' The administration's complete obliviousness to the possibilities for energy failures, food and water deprivation, and civil disorder in a major city under siege needs only the Donald Rumsfeld punch line of ''Stuff happens'' for a coup de grâce. How about shared sacrifice, so that this time we might get the job done right? After Mr. Bush's visit on ''Good Morning America'' on Thursday, Diane Sawyer reported on a postinterview conversation in which he said, ''There won't have to be tax increases.'' But on a second go-round, even the right isn't so easily fooled by this drill (with the reliable exception of Peggy Noonan, who found much reassurance in Mr. Bush's initial autopilot statement about the hurricane, with its laundry list of tarps and blankets). This time the fecklessness and deceit were all too familiar. They couldn't be obliterated by a bullhorn or by the inspiring initial post-9/11 national unity that bolstered the president until he betrayed it. This time the heartlessness beneath the surface of his actions was more pronounced. You could almost see Mr. Bush's political base starting to crumble at its very epicenter, Fox News, by Thursday night. Even there it was impossible to ignore that the administration was no more successful at securing New Orleans than it had been at pacifying Falluja. A visibly exasperated Shepard Smith, covering the story on the ground in Louisiana, went further still, tossing hand grenades of harsh reality into Bill O'Reilly's usually spin-shellacked ''No Spin Zone.'' Among other hard facts, Mr. Smith noted ''that the haves of this city, the movers and shakers of this city, evacuated the city either immediately before or immediately after the storm.'' What he didn't have to say, since it was visible to the entire world, was that it was the poor who were left behind to drown. In that sense, the inequality of the suffering has not only exposed the sham of the relentless photo-ops with black schoolchildren whom the president trots out at campaign time to sell his ''compassionate conservatism''; it has also positioned Katrina before a rapt late-summer audience as a replay of the sinking of the Titanic. New Orleans's first-class passengers made it safely into lifeboats; for those in steerage, it was a horrifying spectacle of every man, woman and child for himself. THE captain in this case, Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, was so oblivious to those on the lower decks that on Thursday he applauded the federal response to the still rampaging nightmare as ''really exceptional.'' He told NPR that he had ''not heard a report of thousands of people in the convention center who don't have food and water'' -- even though every television viewer in the country had been hearing of those 25,000 stranded refugees for at least a day. This Titanic syndrome, too, precisely echoes the post-9/11 wartime history of an administration that has rewarded the haves at home with economic goodies while leaving the have-nots to fight in Iraq without proper support in manpower or armor. Surely it's only a matter of time before Mr. Chertoff and the equally at sea FEMA director, Michael Brown (who also was among the last to hear about the convention center), are each awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom in line with past architects of lethal administration calamity like George Tenet and Paul Bremer. On Thursday morning, the president told Diane Sawyer that he hoped ''people don't play politics during this period of time.'' Presumably that means that the photos of him wistfully surveying the Katrina damage from Air Force One won't be sold to campaign donors as the equivalent 9/11 photos were. Maybe he'll even call off the right-wing attack machine so it won't Swift-boat the Katrina survivors who emerge to ask tough questions as it has Cindy Sheehan and those New Jersey widows who had the gall to demand a formal 9/11 inquiry. But a president who flew from Crawford to Washington in a heartbeat to intervene in the medical case of a single patient, Terri Schiavo, has no business lecturing anyone about playing politics with tragedy. Eventually we're going to have to examine the administration's behavior before, during and after this storm as closely as its history before, during and after 9/11. We're going to have to ask if troops and matériel of all kinds could have arrived faster without the drain of national resources into a quagmire. We're going to have to ask why it took almost two days of people being without food, shelter and water for Mr. Bush to get back to Washington. Most of all, we're going to have to face the reality that with this disaster, the administration has again increased our vulnerability to the terrorists we were supposed to be fighting after 9/11. As Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism czar, pointed out to The Washington Post last week in talking about the fallout from the war in Iraq, there have been twice as many terrorist attacks outside Iraq in the three years after 9/11 than in the three years before. Now, thanks to Mr. Bush's variously incompetent, diffident and hubristic mismanagement of the attack by Katrina, he has sent the entire world a simple and unambiguous message: whatever the explanation, the United States is unable to fight its current war and protect homeland security at the same time. The answers to what went wrong in Washington and on the Gulf Coast will come later, and, if the history of 9/11 is any guide, all too slowly, after the administration and its apologists erect every possible barrier to keep us from learning the truth. But as Americans dig out from Katrina and slouch toward another anniversary of Al Qaeda's strike, we have to acknowledge the full extent and urgency of our crisis. The world is more perilous than ever, and for now, to paraphrase Mr. Rumsfeld, we have no choice but to fight the war with the president we have. Op-Ed Columnist"
"The hurricane and the flood that followed took their toll on the cultural riches of New Orleans and the cities in its orbit. Museum directors were still struggling to gain a clear picture of the extent of losses, but some collections seem to have been spared, including the core holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art, one of the most important in the Deep South. The Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane University, which has the world's largest jazz oral history collection, appeared to be safe, said the curator, Bruce Raeburn. Preservation Hall, the 255-year-old French Quarter building that serves as a jazz shrine and performance site, appears to be undamaged. But the roof of the Old U.S. Mint in the French Quarter was damaged, raising concern for the state of its jazz collection, which includes musical instruments, film, posters and photographs. Seven staff members of the New Orleans Museum of Art, including security guards and engineers, stayed behind Tuesday to protect the collection and were presumably there through the week, said E. John Bullard, the museum's director. The Times-Picayune newspaper reported that about 30 relatives of museum staff members had sought refuge in the building, which is on high ground at the edge of City Park. It said the staff members refused to leave the building untended when urged to leave by officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who arrived there Wednesday. Mr. Bullard, who was vacationing in Maine, said Friday that he had heard nothing more. ''The ones who stayed are really the heroes for the museum,'' he said. The museum, which has about 40,000 objects in its collection, has a prominent group of Miró works and other paintings, 16,000 pieces of glass, and major photography holdings. It has an important African collection, and about 100 of the best pieces from it are on tour right now. Mr. Bullard, who has been director of the museum since 1973, feared for an outdoor sculpture garden established two years ago containing 55 works, including pieces by Henry Moore, Louise Bourgeois and Claes Oldenburg. Oak trees towered above. A 45-foot-tall steel tube and cable sculpture by Kenneth Snelson, ''Virlane Tower,'' valued at more than $500,000, was smashed, The Times-Picayune said. The other major concern was basement storage spaces. There was only enough fuel for the emergency generators, which operate sump pumps and climate control systems, to last until the middle of last week. If water invades and the pumps fail, it could threaten thousands of photographs and prints. Mr. Bullard said the museum's insurers had dispatched private security guards from Florida in two campers to protect the artwork and seek out fuel to keep the generators going. The next task would be to transport important artworks out of the city when roads were passable. ''This is a transforming event in a city's life,'' he said. ''Even though New Orleans has been around for 200 years, I wonder whether it can survive.'' The failure of climate control systems in other surviving museums poses a danger, said Ed Able, president of the American Association of Museums in Washington. He said 126 institutions -- art museums, zoos, aquariums and others -- lay within the affected zone. ''All in all, we've got definite collection damage across the affected areas,'' he said. Added to that were fears that dozens of historic houses -- blips on the nation's cultural radar but important parts of the gulf region's identity -- had been smashed into oblivion. Beauvoir, the home of Jefferson Davis in Biloxi, Miss., suffered serious harm, Mr. Able said. Completed in 1851, the site included the Davis presidential library. The Dantzler House historic mansion in Biloxi was destroyed. The Ohr-O'Keefe Museum of Art, a partly built complex of five buildings designed by Frank Gehry, also in Biloxi, was heavily damaged when a floating casino was deposited in its midst. The African-American arts gallery at the complex was demolished, according to Mr. Gehry's office. At least two other exhibit centers appeared to have been spared. Ground was broken for the $30 million museum in 2003, and it was expected to open next year. One building was to be dedicated to the works of George Ohr (1857-1918), a major American ceramicist known as the Mad Potter of Biloxi. The fate of Ohr's work, much of which was located in the Biloxi Library and Cultural Center, was not known for certain, although the museum's executive director, Marjie Gowdy, said, ''We believe the pottery is intact.'' She posted the comment on the Web site of The Sun Herald newspaper in Biloxi. (In Ohr's lifetime, a fire destroyed his studio and much of his work up to then.) Historic buildings in the French Quarter in New Orleans -- the Cabildo, the Presbytere and the Old U.S. Mint -- sustained some damage, according to the Association of Art Museums, which has set up a Web page on the effects of Katrina (aam-us.org/aamlatest/news/HurricaneFirstReports.cfm). The buildings are operated by the Louisiana State Museum. Their collections of archives, books and documents ''are in better shape than feared,'' the association said. Water poured through a blown-off section of roof at the Old Capitol Museum of Mississippi History in Jackson and left hundreds of pieces soggy, ruining some, the association's Web site said. Like utility company teams from elsewhere volunteering their services, conservation experts, through the Southeastern Regional Conservation Association, have offered help in restoring damaged artworks. The Southeastern Museums Conference in Atlanta is helping organize relief for beleaguered museums. The 1921 Orpheum Theater, a former vaudeville hall where the Marx Brothers, Burns and Allen and other acts played, probably suffered water damage. It is the home of the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra. The orchestra's treasurer and timpanist, Jim Atwood, said he saw television video of the area around it showing high waters. He said his two sets of timpani, valued at a total of $40,000, were in the basement and probably severely damaged. One set was one of six made by a prominent maker in Dresden, Germany, that closed down about a decade after the end of World War II. The orchestra library of scores and parts was stored on the sixth floor of another building, and is presumably safe, he said. The flood was a second recent blow to the orchestra, which was reconstituted by the musicians in 1991 after the New Orleans Symphony declared bankruptcy. ''We're hoping against hope we can keep it afloat after this,'' said Mr. Atwood, who was speaking from his cabin in Livermore, Colo. He said the prospects for the orchestra's players would be particularly tough if it failed. ''To have a job as a professional musician, a full-time job, is a very precious things these days,'' he said. ''I just hate the thought of all my colleagues having their jobs slip through their fingers.'' Efforts were under way to find temporary work for the Louisiana Philharmonic musicians as substitutes and extra players in orchestras around the country. The cultural losses produced anguish among the city's musicians and artists and hope that they will be restored. ''Great cities are defined by great art,'' Mr. Atwood said. James W. Bailey, an art photographer who grew up in Mississippi and lived in New Orleans for 20 years, said he had taken thousands of pictures of the city. ''In my life in Mississippi, I dreamed about being an artist,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''It wasn't until I moved to New Orleans that I became one.'' He described the city's spirit as ''absolutely mystical and magical and profoundly spiritual,'' a spirit that gave rise to an artistic legacy that spread through the world. ''The fact that we are on the verge of losing this is hard to believe,'' he said. ''It has not sunk in that there is the possibility in the next few days that the city of New Orleans is going to be shut down, turned off and turned into a ghost land.'' STORM AND CRISIS: CULTURE"
"St. Bernard Parish, just to the east of New Orleans and surrounded by water -- more island than peninsula since Hurricane Katrina -- is nearly empty now, the vast majority of its 68,000 residents scattered to who knows where. Chalmette, the parish seat, was best known as the site of the Battle of New Orleans, one of the last skirmishes in the War of 1812. But in the last few days, Chalmette -- a mostly white, working-class community where two oil refineries, a natural-gas processing plant and some fisheries make up most of the local economy -- has been the scene of a fight for survival. According to the three men who run the parish -- the parish president, the sheriff and the fire chief, who said they saw it themselves -- hundreds of residents were killed, including 31 found in a nursing home. Officials said there were 65 residents at the nursing home, St. Rita's, but they could not say how some of them survived while others perished. Elsewhere in the parish, the officials said 22 bodies were found bound together in a subdivision. Officials were uncertain of the circumstances, but they said the victims most likely tried to keep together to weather the storm. ''I will never again tell people that help is on the way,'' said Thomas M. Stone, the parish fire chief. ''It's not coming.'' The problems in St. Bernard Parish are being played out across southeastern Louisiana, where lowlands and a sparse system of highways combined to leave pockets of residents in dire straits and cut off from assistance. State officials acknowledged that in the desperate push to save thousands of people in New Orleans, nearby parishes had been overlooked. ''If you're not getting info on the area, you have to assume it's bad,'' a spokesman for the Louisiana National Guard, Lt. Col. Pete Schneider, said earlier in the week in an interview in Baton Rouge. A group of visitors, including journalists, who were accompanied by a state senator, Walter J. Boasso, were led on a tour of Chalmette, Arabi and other towns on Saturday to try to focus attention on the area. The visitors had to pass three checkpoints staffed by shotgun-wielding police officers, take a ferry across the Mississippi River and board four-wheel-drive vehicles to reach the parish. In a telephone interview on Saturday night, Joseph A. Donchess, executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association, said he was told about the deaths at the nursing home on Friday by the Coast Guard, which had sent a reconnaissance team there. ''Thank God, some people did survive,'' Mr. Donchess said. ''Some people were literally plucked out of the water by Coast Guard helicopters and were evacuated to the airport and sent on to Houston.'' He added, ''This was the most number of deaths in a nursing facility that has been reported to me.'' St. Bernard, a marshy area, appears to have been particularly hard hit by Hurricane Katrina, but local officials say scores of lives were lost because of the delay in official response. They said they felt all but forsaken by the federal government. ''If anybody should have been prepared for this, it should have been the federal government,'' said Henry J. Rodriguez Jr., the president of the parish government. A few signs of a federal presence in the parish were evident on Saturday. A Navy helicopter landed near a warehouse that has been used to store emergency supplies. But the bulk of the assistance has come, instead, from a hodgepodge of sources: neighboring parishes, state police, boat-owning volunteers and other officials. The presence of authority itself seemed precarious. Mr. Rodriguez and members of the seven-member Parish Council were holed up in an oil refinery. The Fire Department has regrouped in the parking lot of a BellSouth building filled with telecommunications equipment. The Sheriff's Department is now based on the Cajun Queen, a ferry boat parked in Arabi. From their separate vantage points, the officials in this forlorn area have been trying to communicate, but with limited success. Sheriff Jack Stephens said a sheriff's substation, one of five in the parish, had been taken over by armed squatters, but Mr. Rodriguez disputed what had occurred at the substation. ''That wasn't civil disobedience, that was people trying to get out of the weather,'' he said. Sheriff Stephens, interviewed on the Cajun Queen, also said federal assistance had been minimal. ''I have Royal Canadian Mounties who have gotten here faster than the federal government,'' he said. ''I have made more life-and-death decisions in the last four or five days than I have in 22 years.'' The Canadians were actually members of a 47-member search-and-rescue team sent from the municipal government in Vancouver, British Columbia. Its members have gone from house to house, extracting survivors who have weathered the storm and its bitter aftermath. At least 200 were identified yesterday, said Terry Nikolai, a member of the Canadian team. Officials were still trying to fathom the devastation. Maj. Pete Tufaro of the Sheriff's Department said 43 people were found dead in the first day of door-to-door checks. It was unclear if that included the dead at the nursing home. Mark Melancon, a firefighter who has been living with colleagues in the BellSouth building, said they had begun shaving their heads at night, in an act of mourning, despair and distraction. ''The number of bodies we're finding is unbelievable,'' he said. Even some people who were able to get to the parish's evacuation centers did not survive. Representative Charlie Melancon, a Democrat who represents the area, said in an interview in Baton Rouge that 100 people in St. Bernard Parish had died while trying to leave, which he attributed to a lack of water and food. Deputies had returned heartbroken after their search missions, pulling naked infants from the water and stacking bodies in the parish jail and courthouse, said Lt. Jeff Lee, of the sheriff's department. ''When we start hitting down the doors, there's no telling what the body count will be,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: ST. BERNARD PARISH"
"Facing extensive damage by Hurricane Katrina to naval installations in Mississippi, the Navy turned immediately to the Halliburton Company's KBR subsidiary for tasks like restoring electricity, repairing roofs and clearing debris at bases that are urgently needed for response efforts. It is a familiar role for KBR, which under longstanding contracts has delivered the engineering equivalent of first aid to the Navy and other military and government agencies after natural disasters for more than 15 years. This time, the Halliburton unit's performance is likely to be watched especially closely, as its work under separate contracts in Iraq has come under extensive criticism in the past two years. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command turned to Halliburton after the hurricane under terms of a five-year contract worth up to $500 million, renewed in 2004 after competitive bidding, that calls on the company to provide immediate services on demand after natural disasters, in humanitarian crises or in military conflicts. Last year, the Navy invoked the same contract after Hurricane Ivan hit Florida. Although Halliburton has not yet been asked to work on installations around New Orleans, it said on Friday that it would begin performing damage assessments there ''as soon as it is deemed safe to do so.'' The Navy faces urgent problems repairing installations such as the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Gulfport, Miss., which was heavily damaged and has become a crucial staging point for recovery operations in the coastal area hit hardest by the hurricane. Almost all the base's personnel were evacuated before the storm, and there were no military casualties reported, but many buildings were damaged, power and communications were out, and roads were blocked or flooded. But even as the Halliburton contract was being announced on Friday, the base was getting back in business, feeding 1,200 personnel each day, sheltering 350 Federal Emergency Management Agency employees in a warehouse, preparing to build a tent city for FEMA, supporting 1,000 employees of Mississippi Power, and deploying Seabees into nearby communities. Even as it prepared for new jobs in the disaster area, both under its military contract and in its broader civilian role as a major engineering and construction company involved in ports and oil services, Halliburton and its employees faced problems of their own from the storm. The company said on Friday that it had 3,000 employees working in the affected region and that ''many have suffered devastating losses with many homes and vehicles flooded and some with a total loss of all of their belongings.'' The company, headed by Dick Cheney before he became vice president, has close ties to the Bush administration, and earlier this year confirmed that it had hired Joseph M. Allbaugh as a consultant on issues including disaster relief and homeland security. Mr. Allbaugh was the director of FEMA during the first two years of the Bush administration. STORM AND CRISIS: THE NAVY"
"Congressional Democrats said on Tuesday that the arrest of a former senior White House budget official involved in organizing the federal response to Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the need for an independent investigation of the government's reaction to the disaster, especially since the official is married to a leading Republican Congressional aide. The official, David H. Safavian, 38, a lawyer who was chief of procurement policy in the Office of Management and Budget until he resigned on Friday, was arrested Monday on charges of lying to federal investigators about his relationship with Jack Abramoff, a Washington lobbyist at the center of a corruption investigation at the Justice Department. Mr. Safavian, who is free without bail, was also accused of lying about a 2002 golfing trip he took with Mr. Abramoff, a former lobbying partner, when Mr. Safavian worked at the General Services Administration. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said the arrest of Mr. Safavian undermined the credibility of a House Republican plan to investigate the troubled hurricane-relief effort through a committee to be led by Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia. Mr. Safavian's wife, Jennifer, is chief counsel for oversight and investigations on the House Government Reform Committee, which Mr. Davis leads. ''Spouses are not responsible for their counterpart's activities,'' Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. ''But I do say when there is a direct link to the White House and procurement and the investigation that this committee is supposed to conduct, then I think that really shatters all sense of confidence.'' Her criticism was echoed on Capitol Hill, with Democrats saying that beyond the criminal charges, Mr. Safavian had lacked the background for an important federal procurement post. They also said he was one of several senior Bush administration officials involved in the sluggish hurricane-relief effort who had been chosen for their jobs because of political connections. Michael D. Brown, who was chosen by President Bush to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency, resigned last week after widespread criticism that he and many of his top aides had had little emergency management experience. Democrats have also been critical of the recent nomination of a lawyer with little immigration experience to lead the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security. The lawyer, Julie L. Myers, is the niece of Gen. Richard B. Myers of the Air Force, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ''I'd be interested in how Mr. Safavian got his job,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''Mr. Safavian doesn't have the credentials that would justify his being the top procurement person for the White House. Did any influential members of Congress recommend him to that job? Is there a connection between his wife and that recommendation?'' The General Services Administration, which manages government buildings and other property, refused to answer questions Tuesday about how Mr. Safavian got his job as the agency's chief of staff from 2002 until last year. Clay Johnson III, deputy director of management for the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement that he had urged that Mr. Safavian be hired at the budget office last year because ''I was impressed with his knowledge of the issues, agencies and the Hill.'' ''No one interfered or pressured me to do it,'' Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Safavian was involved in developing broad policies for federal contracting in the hurricane-relief effort along the Gulf Coast, but Mr. Johnson said Mr. Safavian had nothing to do with awarding individual contracts for emergency relief work. ''No one at O.M.B.,'' he said, ''including Mr. Safavian, is authorized to be involved in any contracting decisions, and I'm not aware of that happening. It's not part of our mission.'' Mr. Davis said through a spokesman that he had done nothing to help Mr. Safavian obtain his jobs in the administration. Mr. Safavian and his wife did not respond to telephone messages left at their home in Alexandria, Va. The Justice Department did not notify news organizations of the arrest until after Mr. Safavian had made his first court appearance, which prevented reporters from observing the hearing. His lawyer also did not return phone calls for comment. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security stepped up their efforts on Tuesday to rescue the nomination of Ms. Myers, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, to the immigration post. ''Julie Myers is well-respected within the law enforcement community and highly qualified to lead the Immigration and Customs Enforcement,'' said Erin Healy, a White House spokeswoman. ''We will work with the Senate to ensure her confirmation.'' But the nomination faced new challenges, some not directly related to Ms. Myers's qualifications. Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, threatened Tuesday to block the nomination unless he received a secret F.B.I. memo about interrogations of terror suspects that he has been seeking for months; the May 2004 memorandum details the concerns of F.B.I. agents about the interrogation of suspected members of Al Qaeda held at the Navy base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Democrats have questioned whether the memorandum mentions Michael Chertoff, who directed the Justice Department's criminal division in Mr. Bush's first term and who is now the secretary of homeland security. Ms. Myers, whose nomination to the Homeland Security job was the subject of an article in the Tuesday editions of The Washington Post, had been Mr. Chertoff's chief of staff at the Justice Department. She married Mr. Chertoff's current chief of staff last weekend."
"Hurricane Katrina has given the nation a new political celebrity, the mayor of beleaguered New Orleans. And like they say with pride here about most everything, Mayor C. Ray Nagin is just plain different. A former business executive, Mr. Nagin is a Democrat who lashed out at Republican Washington, likes to cuss, has begun treating the president whose administration he lambasted as a buddy and makes no secret of his differences with the state's governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, also a Democrat. Mostly, he seems to be unapologetically making it up as he goes along, as he did on Monday when he (temporarily) defied official advice to slow the reopening of his city. After Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard and President Bush very publicly advised caution, Mr. Nagin backed down and reversed his order to have people return gradually. He retreated with sword raised. ''There's only one mayor of New Orleans and I'm it,'' he said, attributing his reversal to a ''new event'' -- the prospect that Hurricane Rita might head for the Gulf Coast. That kind of bravado is classic Nagin, an unorthodox politician of 49 who was a top cable executive before he ran for mayor three years ago. His pre-storm, tenure was seen as a little bumpy as he learned on the job, but not fatally so. Post-storm, Mr. Nagin has made a virtue of being consistently inconsistent. Why fast-track the return of people to a city short on power and potable water, even as he talks about putting safety first? Those who know Mr. Nagin and know New Orleans attribute his rush to three factors: Nagin chemistry, politics and race, with a dash of civic pride thrown in. ''There's a lot of pressure to get business going again in New Orleans, and he got ahead of himself,'' said James W. Nickel, a lobbyist here and former state Democratic chairman. Mr. Nagin, who declined to be interviewed for this article, maintains that politics was not his motive in trying to reopen his city quickly. Few who know the politics of New Orleans, a predominantly black city with a powerful white business core, harbor any doubt that he was responding to pressure from the entrenched white business community, and perhaps, too, from black elected officials worried that their constituents would not return unless assured their city was up and running. Mr. Nagin needed the votes of both constituencies to win election, but white voters held the margin of victory. When he ran for mayor, business executives embraced him as a reformer. He got into the runoff after the black vote split and then went on to a slim victory. ''Candidates running for other offices got more votes than he did,'' the City Council president, Oliver M. Thomas Jr., said on Tuesday. Mr. Thomas has viewed the mayor's conduct post-storm with some skepticism, including his latest flip-flop. ''You can't keep jerking people's chains,'' Mr. Thomas said. Others cite mistakes. Mr. Nagin did not get everyone out, did not fire up the school buses for evacuees, did not have enough food or water for them in the Superdome or the convention center, did not protect people adequately and let the looters loot so he could make rescues the priority. He had to answer for flying to Dallas the second weekend after Hurricane Katrina to visit his evacuated family and for meeting there with white businessmen from New Orleans. This infuriated many of the city's black lawmakers and businessmen, worried about being left out of the rebuilding loop, despite Mr. Nagin's assurances to the contrary. And of course there was the famous flash of Nagin temper on the Thursday after the storm, when he railed at the federal authorities, ''Now get off your asses and do something.'' In most cities, the public would say, Sure, but why didn't you do it first? But in New Orleans, Mr. Nagin was seen as putting the blame squarely on Washington and as alerting the world to his city's emergency. Instead of facing political oblivion, Mr. Nagin has emerged as something of a folk hero, a familiar figure with his distinctive shirts and shaved head. In some places in the country, mayors pay for big mistakes at election time. Mr. Nagin faces a primary election in February, and for now, the talk here is that he is not in big trouble, that he, like his city, was a victim of Washington and Ms. Blanco, whose reputation has suffered while his seems to be holding. ''You experience accountability in other places,'' said Roy W. Fletcher, a political consultant in Baton Rouge. ''Here, while everybody wants something from government, nobody expects something from government.'' Some New Orleanians are furious at Mr. Nagin. Others attribute his stumbles to an unfamiliarity with practical politics that pre-dated Hurricane Katrina. ''He truly thought he could go into government and run it like a business,'' said Mr. Nickel, the former Democratic chairman. ''If any government can't run like a business, it is the government of New Orleans.'' But the mayor, a native of the city from a working-class family, is considered honest and strongly opposed to the old, often corrupt ways, yet limited by his city's poverty and its people's low expectations. ''If he had gotten those people out, it would have been shocking,'' said Alvin Gauthier, a science teacher and basketball coach at a New Orleans high school, as he waited in line here on Monday at the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief center. In fact, as early as July, the mayor and emergency officials were warning that the city did not have the resources to evacuate everyone if a major hurricane hit, The Times-Picayune reported. Yet nothing significant changed, which was not a surprise. ''This isn't the United States, darling; this is a colony of the powers that be,'' a rug dealer named Bob Rue said on Saturday in New Orleans, where he was protecting his shop on St. Charles Avenue with a revolver and a claw hammer. ''There's no tax base,'' Mr. Rue said. Too many people, he added, are too poor. He was asked why not demand more from the state, more from the wealthy? Mr. Rue, looking as though he wanted to use his claw hammer, sighed. Listen, he seemed to be saying, he survived. And so, it would seem, did Mr. Nagin. -- survived a storm that damaged almost everything and everyone in its path, including a president. But somehow there is a sense of tolerance from his constituents for their mayor, because, they say, at least he tried -- considered an accomplishment in their hometown. STORM AND CRISIS: NEW ORLEANS MEMO"
"Along the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, great earthen levees were ample to hold off much of the surging water propelled by Hurricane Katrina. But concrete flood walls installed over the last several decades along the drainage and barge canals cutting into New Orleans were built in a way that by Army Corps of Engineers standards left them potentially unstable in a flood, according to government documents and interviews. The walls collapsed in several places during the storm. A corps engineering manual cautions that such flood walls ''rarely exceed'' seven feet because they can lose stability as waters rise. But some of the New Orleans canal walls rose as high as 11 feet above dirt berms in which they were anchored. As a result of federal budget constraints, the walls were never tested for their ability to withstand the cascades of lake water that rushed up to, or over, their tops as storm waves pulsed through the canals on Aug. 29, corps and local officials say. Hurricane Katrina was the first serious test of the flood walls, said Stevan Spencer, chief engineer for the Orleans Levee District, and it ''just overwhelmed the system.'' Since the storm, corps officials have said that there is a simple explanation for the devastation: Hurricane Katrina was a Category 4 storm and Congress authorized a flood control system to handle only a Category 3 storm. ''Anything above that, all bets are off,'' said Al Naomi, a senior project manager in the corps's New Orleans district. But federal meteorologists say that New Orleans did not get the full brunt of the storm, because its strongest winds passed dozens of miles east of the city. While a formal analysis of the storm's strength and surges will take months, the National Hurricane Center said the sustained winds over Lake Pontchartrain reached only 95 miles per hour, while Category 3 storms are defined by sustained winds of 111 to 130 m.p.h. This raises a series of questions about how the walls that failed were designed and constructed, as well as whether the soil in some spots was too weak to hold them. Investigations by federal engineers and outside experts are just now beginning. One factor could be height, said Robert G. Bea, a former corps engineer and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is part of a National Science Foundation inquiry into the flood controls failures. The higher the wall, Professor Bea said, the greater the risk it could tip under the ever greater pressure of rising waters. The 2000 edition of the Army Corps of Engineers manual ''Design and Construction of Levees'' says that the height of flood walls built on levees is an important factor in their ability to withstand a flood. For that reason, the manual says walls like those used in New Orleans ''rarely exceed'' seven feet. But on two of the three canals where breaks occurred -- the 17th Street and London Avenue canals -- the concrete sections rise 11 feet above the dirt berms. Each wall resembles a row of teeth set in a jaw. Individual slabs are anchored to a continuous steel sheet buried in the dirt, giving the wall its strength. Above a short foundation, the slabs are linked only by rubbery gaskets that allow the concrete to expand and contract without cracking. Hassan S. Mashriqui, an engineering professor at Louisiana State University and an expert on storm surges, said the segmented nature of the walls could be an additional problem, since any weak point could cause a catastrophic failure. ''Since they're not tied together you get a little bit of a gap and that's what water needs to make it fail,'' Dr. Mashriqui said. Other questions surround the walls' design, known as an ''I-wall'' for its slim cross section that fits easily into densely developed areas. The corps manual for flood control construction suggests a different design for walls higher than seven feet -- walls shaped like an inverted T, with the horizontal section buried in the dirt for extra stability. But that option was never considered, corps engineers said, because ''T walls'' were more expensive, required a broad base of dense soil for support and were not necessarily stronger. The corps and local levee authorities also never tested whether the chosen I-wall design could survive if water flowed over the top and cascaded onto dirt embankments below. Corps officials said they were proscribed from considering stronger wall designs for the canals both by the tight quarters and by federal law, which requires that they seek and study only the level of flood control authorized by Congress. ''Our hands are tied as to looking at higher-level events,'' Mr. Naomi said. Mr. Naomi said that the recommendations in the flood control engineering manual were ''general guidance,'' and that conditions at a particular site could justify deviations. He defended the walls, saying: ''The flood walls have functioned over the years very successfully and without incident. The design works. It has worked in other locales. And will likely continue to be used as long as you do not subject it to pressures that it was not designed to handle.'' The broken walls, which were long seen as a second choice to earthen levees, are testament to 40 years of fiscal and political compromises made by elected officials, from local levee boards to Congress and several presidential administrations, as they balanced costs and environmental concerns with the need to protect a city that lies largely below sea level and is still subsiding. Ever since Hurricane Betsy flooded parts of New Orleans in 1965, the federal government has financed a hurricane defense system designed to guard against an equivalent storm. But as the threat of a more intense hurricane became better understood in recent years, government financing for flood prevention in New Orleans did not keep pace with a growing alarm among many local residents, scientists and even the corps's own engineers. Standing next to the shattered remains of one of the concrete walls last week, Cynthia Hedge-Morrell, a New Orleans councilwoman, said, ''In my opinion, they were playing Russian roulette with people's lives.'' ''Do you realize that if those walls had held, we'd have just had a little cleaning job?'' said Ms. Hedge-Morrell, whose district between downtown and the lakefront was covered with 10 feet of water from the breaks of flood walls. ''We would not have this massive loss of life and destruction.'' On Tuesday, streams of dump trucks hurriedly dumped loads of gravel into the breaches in New Orleans's flood defenses, in case Hurricane Rita shifts toward here later this week. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, a surge from Lake Pontchartrain poured into the main parts of the city through breaks on the walls lining the 17th Street and London Avenue canals, which normally carry runoff pumped out of the city into the lake. A separate surge from the Gulf of Mexico overwhelmed the walls along the Industrial Canal, inundating the Lower Ninth Ward. Officials say that break may have been caused by a barge that broke loose from its moorings. When the hurricane hit, the only earthen levees that failed in a way that produced substantial flooding were on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a man-made ship canal east of the city. These levees, which were not as high as those on the river or Lake Pontchartrain, let in the floodwaters that ravaged eastern New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish. A surge from Lake Pontchartrain was the catastrophic situation that the corps had been guarding against since Hurricane Betsy 40 years ago. Initially, the corps wanted to build a giant barrier to keep water from the Gulf of Mexico from reaching Lake Pontchartrain and flooding the canals. That project was delayed by lawsuits from environmental groups that contended the corps had failed to study ecological effects. By the late 1970's, the corps abandoned that approach and began raising levees along the lake and the Mississippi and adding flood walls on the canals. In the mid-1990's, engineering professors at Louisiana State began publicizing computer models that showed how a Category 5 storm could kill tens of thousands of people and flood the French Quarter. Corps officials in Louisiana pushed local officials to help seek more money from Congress, both to finish existing upgrades and to start bolstering the city against bigger threats. Joseph Suhayda, who was one of the Louisiana State professors, said corps officials privately urged him to ''raise the consciousness'' about the dire threats. But upgrading the flood control system never became a major priority for corps officials in Washington, local and federal officials say. Corps veterans said it was not surprising that federal engineers did not issue more vocal warnings. ''I don't think it was culturally in the system for the corps to say 'this is crazy,''' said William F. Marcuson III, the former director of the Waterways Experiment Station for the corps in Vicksburg, Miss., and president-elect of the American Society of Civil Engineers. ''The corps works for Congress,'' Mr. Marcuson said, ''and when the boss says design for a Category 3 storm, culturally the corps is not going to go back and say this is wrong.'' Investigations into how the walls failed are just now beginning. Col. Richard Wagenaar, commander of the corps district in New Orleans, said the soil behind the flood walls could have been weakened after they were topped by the storm surge, or the walls could have simply given way as the water -- and the pressure -- mounted against them. Indeed, as several engineers said, while a dirt levee of similar height might eventually be topped as well, and possibly eroded, only the walls were vulnerable to a sudden collapse. The determination of how the walls fell will bear on how officials decide to remake the flood control system. Max Hearn, executive director of the Orleans Levee District, said that if the federal government was now ready to pay for Category 5 protection, it seemed unlikely that the flood wall system could be upgraded to that level. But Mr. Hearn said the only answer might be the construction of flood gates designed to limit a hurricane surge in Lake Pontchartrain -- the same idea that was considered and dropped in the 1970's. STORM AND CRISIS: THE DEFENSES"
"At 68, Lucille Sewell is something of a disaster veteran. A retired nurse, she has traveled twice in the last year from her hometown in Oklahoma to Indonesia -- to Simeulue Island after an earthquake there and to Banda Aceh after the tsunami. So when she saw the television coverage of the misery wrought by Hurricane Katrina, she says, her reaction was immediate: ''Oh, I have to go.'' A few days later, she once again left her two children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild, and headed to Louisiana. She slept for more than a week on the floor of a church here, dishing out food and love to hurricane victims as part of a Southern Baptist relief team. One day, she noticed a woman looking at her across the gymnasium, her eyes brimming with despair. The woman had been among the thousands stranded for days at the Superdome in New Orleans, Mrs. Sewell later learned. ''I just walked across to her, and she cried,'' Mrs. Sewell said. Three years ago, Mrs. Sewell lost her husband to cancer, and she asked God what he would have for her now. ''I can serve you,'' she said. But she wondered whether she truly could. Her husband, Leon, a retired Southern Baptist preacher, had been her everything for 24 years. Mrs. Sewell, a slip of a woman, barely five feet tall, was unsure how she would face the world. ''He was the love of my life,'' she said. ''I was lost.'' Slowly, however, she inched back. She joined her church's quilting group and seniors' group. She taught Sunday school. And she signed up for disaster relief training with the Southern Baptist Convention. ''I didn't just sit there and hold my hands,'' she said. ''I knew I had to go on with life.'' Until she returned home the other day to Mustang, Okla., she worked long hours in Baton Rouge, rising with a few others at 4:30 a.m. to prepare breakfast for the rest of the team. Then the work began. It was hardly glamorous: assembling cutlery, crackers, fruit and other items to pack inside plastic foam containers; serving people; and then cleaning up. After dinner, the group would meet for a devotional session. When Mrs. Sewell led the discussion for the first time, she told how she had gotten here, how she had found her way back to life. The Scripture she shared was from the Book of Philippians. The verse had comforted on her first trip abroad, when she wondered what, if anything, she could give. It says, ''Let your gentleness be evident to all.'' MICHAEL LUO STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"Hurricane Rita brushed past Key West on Tuesday and was forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane later in the week, prompting residents and rescuers to begin evacuating this feeble city, as well as parts of Louisiana and Texas. From the tip of the Florida peninsula to Galveston, Tex., thousands left their homes or made plans to, including many who had already fled once, from Hurricane Katrina, and were living in shelters and temporary housing. In Houston, officials moved evacuees from New Orleans out of the Reliant Arena and sent many of them on to Arkansas. In Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco asked President Bush on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency for her battered state as it prepares for Hurricane Rita. She requested $10 million in assistance. Churning undiminished toward the warm and wide Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Rita could strengthen to Category 4 intensity as it approaches Texas later this week, said Colin McAdie, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Hurricane Katrina was a Category 4 storm when it devastated parts of the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Aug. 29. Mr. McAdie said western Louisiana could also bear the brunt of the storm depending on changes in steering currents. ''It's better not to nail it down too precisely,'' he said. ''Over the next day or so we'll have a better idea.'' The threat of a new storm aligned federal and local authorities in Louisiana, at least publicly, after weeks of tension over the response to Hurricane Katrina. President Bush, who had visited Mississippi earlier, attended a briefing in New Orleans. Later in the day, Mr. Bush signed legislation to increase the borrowing authority of the government's flood insurance program to $3.5 billion from $1.5 billion to pay claims from Hurricane Katrina. ''All up and down this coastline people are now preparing for what is anticipated to be yet another significant storm,'' the president said. He said Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen would remain in charge of the federal effort in Louisiana and Mississippi and that ''we've got another admiral who is now being stationed in Texas, to coordinate the relief response.'' Mr. Bush also praised the New Orleans mayor, C. Ray Nagin, who decided Monday to suspend a staggered reopening of parts of the city. ''He made a wise decision to say to people, be cautious about returning here, because a rain of any amount could cause these levees to break again,'' the president said. The mayor, prickly a day earlier under pressure from the president and Admiral Allen to delay the return of residents into parts of the city, gave the admiral a T-shirt at a news conference on Tuesday outside City Hall, where generators still supply power and most key operations have moved across the street to the battered Hyatt Hotel. Mr. Nagin said the words on the T-shirt read: ''I love New Orleans.'' The official death toll in Louisiana remained at 736. In Mississippi, 219 people died from the storm. The Associated Press reported that a 72-year-old man, John Lyons, had been found alive in his home in New Orleans. Mr. Lyons's wife, Leola, also 72, was found dead. In the city, mostly empty of residents but with its physical core still vulnerable, the possibility of heavy rain and a storm surge prompted officials to make emergency efforts to bolster its weakened levee system, station 500 buses on its outskirts to evacuate remaining residents and establish a military hospital at the convention center, which just weeks ago was the scene of violence and desperation for thousands of trapped evacuees from Hurricane Katrina. In Florida, Hurricane Rita lashed Key West as it passed about 50 miles south of the island on Tuesday afternoon, flooding roads, yards and beaches through much of the Keys but not inflicting the severe damage many had feared. Late Tuesday night, it bordered on Category 3 strength as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, with sustained winds near 110 miles per hour. The Lower and Middle Keys were cut off from the rest of Florida for most of the day after Route 1 closed because of flooding. A quarter-mile section of the highway on Lower Matecumbe Key was closed because of a storm surge. Law enforcement officials said the roads were strewn with debris, although that did not stop the curious from driving. A few bars and restaurants stayed opened and drew restless crowds. ''We were not asked to close, and we won't close until we are,'' said Michael Pastore, a bartender at Don's Place, a Key West bar that opened at 7 a.m. on Tuesday. By late afternoon, about 24,000 homes and businesses in Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties had no electricity far fewer than when Hurricane Katrina hit South Florida on Aug. 26, killing 11. In Miami, which suffered only rain squalls, tame winds and minor flooding, officials said government offices and schools would reopen Wednesday. Gov. Jeb Bush said that 2,400 National Guard troops had been mobilized and 2,000 more were on alert in case the storm the seventh to hit Florida in 13 months -- proved devastating. Hospitals and nursing homes in the Keys, eager to avoid the mistakes of New Orleans, evacuated their patients on Monday. In New Orleans, Mr. Nagin said perhaps as few several hundred people were still living in the city's most vulnerable areas, in addition to the thousands of military and emergency workers who had come to help it recover. Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré, who is leading military efforts in the recovery, emphasized that evacuees taken to the convention center would be quickly transported out of town. ''We're not going back into that convention center and Superdome business,'' he said, alluding to the days of televised despair when tens of thousands of mostly poor black residents were trapped by floodwaters in the two buildings. Two busloads of residents were evacuated from the convention center on Tuesday, the mayor said. The mayor said officials would be more aggressive in pushing for evacuation on Wednesday if the storm turns toward the city, but he said they would not force people from their homes. General Honoré said about 14,000 troops in the region would move into shelters capable of withstanding Category 5 storms, the strongest measured on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The city's weakened levee system could be breached by a storm surge as low as five feet, said Brig. Gen. Robert Crear of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps, which has used sandbags, stones and concrete to seal breaches in several levees, does not expect the levees to be fully repaired until June 1, the start of the 2006 hurricane season. General Crear said canals with repaired levees were being blocked at Lake Pontchartrain, to prevent pressure from building on the levees. In addition to storm damage, he said that the levees may have been damaged by barges that broke lose during Hurricane Katrina but that he was not certain. ''We had barges sitting on top of levees,'' he said. ''We had barges sitting on the other side of levees. We don't know yet. We have not done the forensics yet.'' The state continued to grapple with the costs of the destruction from Hurricane Katrina. The governor announced that she had signed an order freezing the state budget in anticipation of a loss of $750 million to $1 billion in state revenues from the effects of thee hurricanes. That order, signed Monday night, includes a hiring freeze for state agencies and is intended to save $30 million to $50 million in spending, she said, adding that it ''will be the first of many.'' Officials in Galveston called for a voluntary evacuation before Hurricane Rita emerged into the gulf. Mr. Bush said Tuesday that he had also spoken to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas ''on the planning for what we pray is not a devastating storm -- but there's one coming.'' R. David Paulison, the acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in Washington on Tuesday that 45 truckloads of water, 45 truckloads of ice and 8 truckloads of ready-to-eat meals were being staged in Texas in advance of the storm. Nine urban search and rescue teams and nine disaster medical assistance teams also are to arrive. The agency, still facing criticism for its response to Hurricane Katrina, has more search and rescue teams available in Texas than it did along the Gulf Coast in the advance of Hurricane Katrina. The Texas National Guard has also started withdrawing troops from Louisiana to prepare for landfall by Hurricane Rita, Louisiana National Guard officials said. About 1,000 Texas troops were recalled, Lt. Michael Odie said. Along Interstate 10, convoys of military trucks drove west, some with handwritten signs with ''Katrina'' crossed out and ''Rita'' written beside the words ''Texas Bound.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"The worst part is the images they cannot blot out. A sister, trapped in rising water without an ax. A brother's body left in a bathtub by the road in hopes that it would not be overlooked. A father, blind and lame, struggling to swim in a flooding nursing home. An old woman, alone with her cats. If only they could have their loved one's body, they say, the imagined film loops might stop. If only they could see them, say prayers over them and lay them, finally, to rest. But of the 736 known people killed by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana within the past three weeks, few have been returned to their families for burial. Instead, families tell of an endless series of frantic calls to the Coast Guard, the Red Cross, state troopers and city constables, sheriffs and coroners, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a call center in Baton Rouge staffed by well-meaning but unknowledgeable volunteers. The uncertainty has produced anguish in a community known for attaching special importance to final goodbyes, with elaborate rites and elegant cemeteries. ''I guess it's just torture, mental torture,'' said Linda Hymel Lund, whose brother, Daryl J. Hymel, 50, was found dead by a friend in a part of Orleans Parish known as Irish Bayou. National Guardsmen instructed the friend to leave the body in a bathtub for retrieval, and Ms. Lund does not know what happened after that. ''Day in and day out, we don't know where he is,'' she said. For Ms. Lund, the oldest of five siblings, the days swing between tears of frustration and those of grief, endless rounds of calls to various agencies and a focused meditation of recollection: the v-shaped scar on the back of Daryl's knee, his thin build, the cyst recently removed from his chin, the faint mark on his upper lip. Surely, she thinks, somewhere there is a body bag marked ''Bathtub, Irish Bayou.'' If she could just look at his teeth, she thinks, she would know him right away. ''They tell us, 'Don't go to St. Gabriel,' for reasons I don't know,'' she said, referring to a temporary morgue set up by federal officials. ''I just want him, I just pray that he is there. Just do whatever you need to do to tell me. I want to know -- that whatever's in that body bag is my brother.'' In Louisiana, FEMA officials, state health officials and local coroners have all declined to say how many bodies have been identified and returned to their next of kin. Out of 6,300 calls as of Monday night, more than 800 families had been connected with living relatives, but just 61 with dead ones, and that does not necessarily mean that those bodies have been released, the spokeswoman there, Heather Murphy, said. The D.W. Rhodes Funeral Homes, which had five locations in New Orleans but is now working out of its office in Baton Rouge, is serving 20 families so far with Hurricane Katrina victims, but not all have retrieved their loved one's bodies. In contrast, Mississippi coroners have released the names of almost 70 of their 219 confirmed victims, including several married couples and at least one family of four. Names are released only after the next of kin has been notified. ''Families are going through a lot of grief, a lot of uncertainty, and those are the two main themes,'' said Kathleen Rhodes-Astorga of the Rhodes Funeral Home, adding that Rhodes calls the FEMA morgue morning and night, trying to find out when bodies will be released. ''They're uncertain as to when they can have their final goodbye, how they can have their final goodbye.'' She has suggested that some families have a memorial service before they have a body, to help bring some focus to the grieving process. But some, like Victor Duvernay, have refused. His mother, a 79-year-old diabetic, Lorraine Rouzan Duvernay, died at the Lafon Nursing Home of the Holy Order in New Orleans, but her body has not been released. Mr. Duvernay hopes to bury her in the family crypt next to her husband. ''For me right now, it's not about placing blame,'' he said. ''I just want to put some closure to my mom's situation, that's all. When my mom is in the tomb, I'll be satisfied.'' Mr. Duvernay's grief, like that of many other hurricane survivors, is compounded by uncertainty -- his home is destroyed, his city a question mark. For days after the storm, he did not know what had become of his mother. Finally, he got a phone number to the nursing home that was receiving evacuees from Lafon. All day Friday, he called. He was told that one more bus was coming, and that his mother would be on it. Finally, a nun from Lafon told him his mother was dead. ''I was devastated,'' he said. ''I cried. It was just a hurting situation. I thought my mom was safe.'' Families have not been allowed inside the temporary morgue in St. Gabriel, where black plastic sheeting along a chain-link fence shields the operations from view. Dr. Frank Minyard, the New Orleans coroner, said that conditions at the morgue, which is primarily serving St. Bernard and Orleans Parishes, were difficult and that the process of confirming a body's identification is painstaking, especially bodies that have begun to putrefy after days in the heat or in standing water. Families, Dr. Minyard said, ''have to wait until we're finished processing everybody.'' Elsewhere, there are glitches in the system. All but one of the 15 hurricane-related victims at the Terrebonne Parish coroner's office have been identified, said Bruce Peters, the chief investigator there. But he does not have contact information for several of the families, a mortuary response team has not picked up the bodies, and the call center, which is supposed to be matching families to victims, does not have the names of the Terrebonne dead. The situation is frustrating, Mr. Peters said. ''I don't know when they're going to call for the pickup, when they're going to want us to bring them,'' he said. ''I don't know how long they wait before they decide or what.'' Dr. Randolph Williams, president of the Louisiana State Coroners Association, said coroners had no plan in place to deal with an incident as calamitous as Hurricane Katrina. ''This has become a chaotic, helter-skelter mess from top to bottom,'' Dr. Williams said. Some families have received help only through personal connections. Tim Aitkens, 44, said that because a woman he went to school with was dating a firefighter in Baton Rouge he was able to learn that his aunt's house in St. Bernard Parish was still under water and that the roof had caved in. It was the only shred of information he had after days of phone calls about his aunt, Virginia Aitkens James, 83, who did not evacuate before the storm, choosing instead to stay with her cats. ''I've checked every Web site and called a hundred people, and no one can even say if elderly people are being registered somewhere,'' Mr. Aitkens said. ''If my aunt lived in Thailand, we'd have known by two days after Christmas if she survived the tsunami.'' Even families whose relatives were not victims of Hurricane Katrina have been separated from their dead. Sue Connolly's severely disabled 6-year-old granddaughter, Madison May Estopinal, died in Illinois in late August and was flown to a New Orleans funeral home so she could be buried in the family vault, next to her great-great-grandmother. But the hurricane intervened. For more than two weeks, Ms. Connolly and her daughter, Kim Estopinal, had no idea where Madison's body was. ''We're watching MSN and NBC, and we're watching our hometown float away and we're seeing caskets floating, and nobody seems to know where this precious little girl's body is,'' Ms. Connolly said. ''Anybody we could get in touch with, the Red Cross, the government, Madison wasn't a priority to them.'' After posting the story on the Internet, a former employee called to say that there was no way the body could still be in the funeral home. A funeral director from a sister home, Jerry Schoen, said Madison's funeral home, All Faiths, had been unable to contact families because its files were lost. Finally, 18 days after the storm, the family learned that Madison's body had been taken to a refrigerated trailer in Lutcher, La., an hour's drive west of New Orleans. But by then Madison's body, Mr. Schoen said, was ''unviewable.'' Betty Mullins, 64, said she learned after many phone calls that her father, Shirley Lott, 94, was on the ''death list.'' The nursing home he was in, St. Rita's, had been flooded, and its owners have since been charged with negligent homicide because 34 people drowned there. Ms. Mullins said she had given a DNA sample and photographs of her father and had spoken to the attorney general, who is pressing charges against the nursing home owners. Finally, she was told that her father's body would be released ''sometime this week,'' she said. ''I'm sitting here with my hands folded, waiting for the phone to ring.'' Even as the days drag on into weeks, some families are not ready to assume that a missing family member is dead. Mr. Aitkens said he and his siblings were holding out hope for their aunt. But if she was at the morgue, he said, they did want to know. ''We don't want her there with strangers,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE DEAD"
"Hurricane Rita prompted a mandatory evacuation of this city's public shelters on Tuesday, emptying them as quickly as they had filled just three weeks ago and sending still-dazed survivors of Hurricane Katrina packing off to Arkansas, to the bus terminal, to the airport and, for some who considered themselves lucky, to paid and furnished apartments here in the Houston area. Clustered in the hot sun and with all they had salvaged spilling from black garbage bags, shopping carts and suitcases tied with cords, evacuees set to leave one of the shelters, at Reliant Arena, seemed largely resigned to this new flight, although there were some flashes of temper. Leading a circle of 10 with hands clasped in prayer as buses and taxicabs filled around them, Johnny Jeremiah, minister of the Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist Church here, intoned, ''God, this day, right now, this place, with this foolishness going on, we need you.'' City and county officials, who had moved a vast bureaucracy to house more than 27,000 survivors in four public shelters quickly after the New Orleans disaster, said none of those now leaving the shelters would be put in housing that could be at risk from the approaching storm. But they said they might have to relocate people who had earlier been placed at hotels and motels in low-lying areas. With the new storm's path uncertain, Galveston, which still bears scars from the great hurricane of September 1900 -- the nation's deadliest disaster, with at least 6,000 killed -- ordered a mandatory evacuation to begin at 6 p.m. Wednesday. Mayor Bill White of Houston said that this city of two million would make its own decision Wednesday and that as much as half the population could be called upon to evacuate. In recent days, the dwindling thousands of storm survivors who had been sheltered in the Astrodome and Reliant Arena, as well as the adjacent Reliant Center exhibition hall and the George R. Brown Convention Center, were concentrated largely in the arena, which was finally emptied Tuesday night. For the last hundreds in the arena, the day was particularly trying. Families sat on bundles of possessions like war refugees. Pregnant women and the injured waited in wheelchairs. Red Cross volunteers weaved through the throngs, passing out cold water and pastries. With her month-old daughter asleep in a stroller, Monique Davis scooped up diapers that had spilled over the ground. Nearby lay a trash bag with stuffed animals poking out. A boy rocked solemnly on a wooden hobbyhorse. About 500 people who had applied for apartments and been promised them lined up for buses and taxicabs to get there. Others boarded tour buses to Ellington Field for flights to new shelter at Fort Chaffee, Ark. -- some chose to make the entire trip by bus -- or to George Bush Intercontinental Airport, where Continental Airlines was offering free tickets out. Still others got rides to the Greyhound terminal, where free tickets also awaited. Steve Freeman, an oyster shucker with an injured leg infected from walking through floodwaters, said he planned to take up Continental on the free flight to reach Norfolk, Va., where he heard there were lots of oysters. But he was suspicious of the official motives for the evacuation. ''They've been trying to get us out early,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''We're the working people. They don't want us here.'' Paul Horton, driver of a produce truck, said he would use his airline ticket to fly to Atlanta to join his wife and two children, who had evacuated there with a neighbor. He has been separated from them since the hurricane, Mr. Horton said, when they got out after the water reached chest-high. He was later rescued and evacuated by bus to Dallas, then Arizona, Arkansas and finally the Reliant sports and entertainment complex in Houston. Rohonor R. Randall, in a wheelchair with a bandaged foot ailing from exposure to polluted water, said she was bound for Fort Chaffee, but by bus. ''I'm not afraid of planes, I just like to be on the ground,'' Ms. Randall said. She called for her newfound friend, the Rev. Hugh Hairston, pastor of Loveland Church in Ontario, Calif., a leader of a group of volunteer clerics called Operation Compassion. He offered a prayer for her foot. Ms. Randall gripped his hand and said: ''You never know where life leads you. Life changes in an instant, like God is showing you life is valuable.'' STORM AND CRISIS: TEXAS"
"While Hurricane Katrina has been credited with reinvigorating the daily news media, it may also be breathing new life into an old monthly magazine. For the first time in its 117-year history, National Geographic -- not known for jumping on a breaking news story -- is rushing into print with a special issue on Katrina. The special went to press just two weeks after the hurricane struck on Aug. 29 and is to be available on newsstands by Friday; the normal lead time for the magazine is about six months. The magazine is printing 450,000 copies for distribution within the United States, with a cover price of $4.95 and no advertising. It is donating profits to the hurricane relief effort. The special runs 102 pages, compared with an average of 126 for a normal issue. ''To do a quick turnaround like this is unprecedented for us,'' said Chris Johns, the editor in chief of the magazine and a longtime photojournalist. ''But the response has been so good and the staff was so jazzed about doing it that we'll continue to do this kind of thing.'' The Geographic, which forecast a Katrina-like event almost a year ago, had a photographer on the scene when the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast. Still, it collaborated on the special with several other news organizations, borrowing words and pictures from, among others, The Times-Picayune in New Orleans, The Dallas Morning News, Getty Images and The New York Times. The issue also includes two original essays. The cover picture, from The Austin American-Statesman, shows an anguished black woman and baby -- striking because it is from America, not, as is common with Geographic images, from the third world. Like some other monthlies, notably Life Magazine, National Geographic has suffered circulation losses over the years, partly because of competition from television, partly because of a plethora of more timely niche publications. At its peak in 1989, National Geographic had a worldwide circulation of 10.7 million, with 8.6 million in North America, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Today its circulation is about 9 million worldwide, with 5.25 million in North America. ''The reality is we're in a different marketplace, because general-interest magazines have come and gone,'' Mr. Johns said. The special issue is meant to convey that the magazine can be nimble and relevant. ''We're tightening our monthly publication schedule constantly and becoming more agile,'' he said. That was the message last month, when the magazine produced its August issue with two different covers, one on hurricanes, distributed in the American Southeast, and the other on alternative fuels, distributed everywhere else. ''One of our best readership areas is Seattle, for example, but how interested are they in hurricanes as opposed to the price of oil?'' Mr. Johns said. He said he wanted to give readers ''what's relevant to them.'' The magazine is also bolstering its staff. Hires include Carolyn White, a former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer's Sunday magazine and former assistant managing editor at Rolling Stone, to be in charge of all text in the magazine, and Bill McNulty, a former maps and graphics editor at The New York Times, as its director of maps. ''We're serious about this,'' Mr. Johns said. ''We want to be great cocktail party chatter, a great informative read. We are not a textbook.'' KATHARINE Q. SEELYE MEDIA TALK"
"Representatives of OPEC said Sunday they were prepared to increase their oil production ceiling but warned that high oil prices were caused by refinery shortfalls, which are beyond their control. The group's president said that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was also discussing an alternative proposal of releasing two million barrels a day of production it currently holds as spare capacity, saying the move would send a strong signal that OPEC had untapped reserves to meet demands. ''These are our reserves and we are offering all we have to the market,'' said Sheik Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the president of OPEC and the oil minister from Kuwait. ''This is a very generous offer that shows OPEC is responsible. Refineries are not our responsibility.'' Still, as they prepared to meet here for the first time since Hurricane Katrina agitated oil markets three weeks ago, some oil ministers, including the representative from Saudi Arabia, indicated they favored raising the group's official production quota by 500,000 barrels a day, an increase of under 2 percent. The moves come in response to pressure from consuming nations that are increasingly concerned about the effect of high prices on their economies. But it is unlikely that either lifting the group's quota or indicating that it is ready to produce more oil will bring much new supply to the market. OPEC says it believes, as do most oil analysts, that the bottleneck in energy supplies comes from the inability of refiners to process enough oil to meet demand, not from a shortage of crude oil. Even if OPEC increased production, it would be unlikely to find many buyers. The refining crunch was worsened after Hurricane Katrina disabled four major refineries along the Gulf of Mexico, which together account for 5 percent of American refining capacity, putting them out of commission for months. ''The constraints are not on the supply side,'' Ali Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, told reporters after arriving in Vienna on Saturday. ''The constraints are downstream. Katrina damaged some infrastructure and that's why people aren't taking crude.'' The group's ceiling is currently set at 28 million barrels a day, excluding the output from Iraq. According to OPEC's most recent statistics, the group's actual production is closer to 28.2 million barrels a day. So the group's oil ministers are left to perform a delicate balancing act as they kick off their two-day meeting on Monday, providing some reassurance that they are serious about keeping oil markets well supplied while realizing they cannot do much to rein in prices. The difficulties of refiners were apparent last week when the United States Energy Department said it had sold 11 million barrels from the nation's strategic reserves, only a third of the 30 million barrels it had initially pledged. OPEC ministers, who were meeting through Sunday evening, have yet to reach an agreement. Some ministers suggested there was no need to put extra oil on the market. ''The market is well supplied -- actually it is in balance,'' said Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria's representative. ''After Katrina, everybody offered crude but the refining capacity was not there to cope with it.'' Some officials, including the representatives from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, said that an increase in the production ceiling might not be necessary because demand was weakening. After the hurricane punched through America's main energy hub three weeks ago, disrupting production, crippling refiners and pushing prices above $70 a barrel, little was heard from OPEC, an 11-country group that pumps more than a third of the world's crude oil. Instead, consuming nations dipped into their own reserves to make up for the production shortfall from the Gulf of Mexico. To put a lid on prices, the Bush administration took the rare step of tapping into the nation's strategic stocks, something it had always been very reluctant to do. And the International Energy Agency, which usually provides advice on energy policies to 26 industrialized nations, activated its emergency oil plan and released oil for only the second time in its 29-year history. OPEC said then that it was ready to ''fill any supply shortfall,'' while Saudi Arabia said it would open the taps. The trouble is that OPEC has little more to give. Since 2003, the group has cranked up its output by 10 percent, or 2.6 million barrels a day, to make up for a 5 percent jump in global oil demand. That increase leaves only one of OPEC's members, Saudi Arabia, with any spare capacity. The group's top producer, Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 9.5 million barrels a day. It still has 1.5 million barrels a day of extra capacity, but that extra crude has found few buyers because it is consists of a viscous and sulfur-rich variety that refiners have trouble processing. European leaders have been particularly vocal in recent weeks about the impact of high prices. The Europe Union's energy commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, took the unusual step of meeting with Sheik Ahmad, the OPEC president, on Sunday to share his concerns. Even in the United States, where gasoline prices have risen above $3 a gallon for the first time, alternative forms of energy and conservation measures are gaining popularity. Given that climate, OPEC had to act even if the group has little leeway, said Vera de Ladoucette, an energy analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''OPEC has to respond to a political message with a political signal of its own,'' she said. ''They are not irrelevant. But under the present circumstances, they seem a little powerless.''"
"DISASTER has a way of bringing out the best and the worst instincts in the news media. It is a grand thing that during the most terrible days of Hurricane Katrina, many reporters found their gag reflex and stopped swallowing pat excuses from public officials. But the media's willingness to report thinly attributed rumors may also have contributed to a kind of cultural wreckage that will not clean up easily. First, anyone with any knowledge of the events in New Orleans knows that terrible things with non-natural causes occurred: there were assaults, shots fired at a rescue helicopter and, given the state of the city's police department, many other crimes that probably went unreported. But many instances in the lurid libretto of widespread murder, carjacking, rape, and assaults that filled the airwaves and newspapers have yet to be established or proved, as far as anyone can determine. And many of the urban legends that sprang up -- the systematic rape of children, the slitting of a 7-year-old's throat -- so far seem to be just that. The fact that some of these rumors were repeated by overwhelmed local officials does not completely get the news media off the hook. A survey of news reports in the LexisNexis database shows that on Sept. 1, the news media's narrative of the hurricane shifted. The Fox News anchor, John Gibson, helped set the scene: ''All kinds of reports of looting, fires and violence. Thugs shooting at rescue crews. Thousands of police and National Guard troops are on the scene trying to get the situation under control. Thousands more on the way. So heads up, looters.'' A reporter, David Lee Miller, responded: ''Hi, John. As you so rightly point out, there are so many murders taking place. There are rapes, other violent crimes taking place in New Orleans.'' After the interview, Mr. Gibson did acknowledge that ''we have yet to confirm a lot of that.'' Later that night on MSNBC, Tucker Carlson grabbed the flaming baton and ran with it. ''People are being raped,'' he said in a conversation with the Rev. Al Sharpton. ''People are being murdered. People are being shot. Police officers being shot.'' Some journalists did find sources. About 10 p.m. that same evening, Greta Van Susteren of Fox interviewed Dr. Charles Burnell, an emergency room physician who was providing medical care in the Superdome. ''Well, we had several murders. We had three murders last night. We had a total of six rapes last night. We had the day before I think there were three or four murders. There were half a dozen rapes that night,'' he told Ms. Van Susteren. (Dr. Burnell did not return several calls asking for comment.) On the same day, The New York Times referred to two rapes at the Superdome, quoting a woman by name who said she was a witness. It is a fact that many died at the convention center and Superdome (7 and 10 respectively, according to the most recent reports from the coroner), but according to a Sept. 15 report in The Chicago Tribune, it was mostly from neglect rather than overt violence. According to the Tribune article, which quoted Capt. Jeffery Winn, the head of the city's SWAT team, one person at the convention center died from multiple stab wounds and one National Guardsman was shot in the leg. On Sept. 8, Lt. Dave Banelli, head of the sex crimes unit, told a CNN correspondent, Drew Griffin, that his division had reports of two attempted rapes at the Superdome. The caveat here is that rape is a notoriously underreported crime, perhaps more so under the chaotic circumstances. The journalists who dwelled on some of the more improbable stories out of New Orleans might be held to account, except that they eventually received confirmation from both the mayor and the police chief. Appearing on ''Oprah'' on Sept. 6, Chief Eddie Compass said of the Superdome: ''We had little babies in there, some of the little babies getting raped.'' Mayor C. Ray Nagin concurred: ''They have people standing out there, have been in that frickin' Superdome for five days watching dead bodies, watching hooligans killing people, raping people.'' But the night before, Chief Compass had told The Guardian, ''We don't have any substantiated rapes. We will investigate if they come forward.'' Many of the more toxic rumors seem to have come from evacuees, half-crazed with fear sitting through night after night in the dark. Victims, officials and reporters all took one of the most horrific events in American history and made it worse than it actually was. Although I was not in New Orleans, I was at the World Trade Center towers site the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001. People had seen unimaginable things, but a small percentage, many still covered in ash, told me tales that were worse than what actually happened. Mothers throwing babies out of the towers, men getting in fights on the ledges, human heads getting blown out of the buildings, all of which took place so high up in the air that it was hard to distinguish the falling humans from the falling wreckage. ''There is a timeless primordial appeal of the story of a city in chaos and people running loose,'' said Carl Smith, a professor of English and American studies at Northwestern University and the author of ''Urban Disorder and the Shape of Belief.'' He says that urban chaos narratives offered ''the fulfillment of some timely ideas and prejudices about the current social order.'' In New Orleans, the misinformation extracted a terrible toll in another way. An international press eager to jump on American pathology played the unfounded reports for all they were worth, with hundreds of news outlets regurgitating tales of lawlessness. ''They're Going to Kill or Rape Us, Get Us Out'' read the headline in The Daily Star, a British tabloid. ''Tourist Tells of Murder and Rape,'' was one headline in The Australian. ''Snipers Shoot at Hospitals. Evacuees Raped, Beaten,'' The Ottawa Citizen reported. ''I think that citizens of New Orleans have been stigmatized in a way that is going to make it difficult to be accepted wherever they go,'' said Jonathan Simon, who teaches criminal law at the University of California, Berkeley. Howard Witt, the Southwest bureau chief of The Chicago Tribune, wrote early on that much of what he had been told, even by public officials, did not check out. And he found himself inundated by rumors. ''The Web and talk radio fueled these rumors in the days following the storm, and the evacuees themselves contributed to the misinformation because they were so scared,'' he said by telephone from Baton Rouge, La. With the grid down and accurate information at a premium, a game of toxic telephone supplanted logic. ''I talked to a friend and, after the flood, they heard on the radio that a gang of 400 armed black looters were coming over the bridge to Hanrahan, where he lived,'' said Ken Bode, a professor of journalism at DePauw University and a former correspondent for NBC. ''He and his neighbors were sitting in the street with guns and they decided to load up all they could and caravan out. He said the looters never got there because the National Guard turned them back.'' There was no band of looters coming their way, but other things that sound too horrible to be true did happen. The widely reported and seemingly fantastical story about a man shooting at a rescue helicopter was confirmed. And the police in Gretna, La., did in fact turn back hundreds of fleeing refugees on the Crescent City Connector. On Sept. 15, The Chicago Tribune had an extensive report detailing how thugs took some measure of control over people and supplies at the convention center. The Washington Postpublished a vivid article on the same day detailing how grave the situation in the convention center became, but again, the issue of whether people were murdered was left open. And yes, true story, a Louisiana congressman under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation hitched a ride on a National Guard truck to his flood-damaged home to pick up, among other things, a box of documents. A rescue helicopter was diverted from picking up survivors after the truck became stuck. Even now, the real, actual events in New Orleans in the past three weeks surpass the imagination. Who needs urban myths when the reality was so brutal? David Carr"
"Watching the horror unfold on live television, David Hankla and his friends at Duke University felt angry and bewildered. ''It made no sense whatsoever that reporters were getting in and out of New Orleans, but the National Guard couldn't remove those people from the convention center,'' said Mr. Hankla, 20, a sophomore. ''All we knew was that we were sick of being armchair humanitarians and that we intended to help get people out.'' So he and two dorm mates, Sonny Byrd and Hans Buder, set out in Mr. Byrd's Hyundai sedan for a road trip and rescue mission. But heading into New Orleans on Interstate 10 after the all-night drive from Durham, N.C., they were turned back by National Guard troops who said it was not safe to proceed. ''We tried a couple ways in, but they sent us back at each,'' Mr. Hankla said. Demoralized and exhausted, they retreated to Baton Rouge, La., where after a few hours of sleep, they began working at a Red Cross shelter. That afternoon, the three devised a plan to sneak into New Orleans. Visiting a nearby television station, one of them swiped a press pass, which Mr. Hankla altered and duplicated at Kinko's. ''For $11.68 and an hour of work, we became members of the media,'' he said. ''We didn't even have to roll down our windows to get into the city this time.'' At the convention center, Mr. Hankla said he waded through a smell so bad ''it could knock you down.'' ''A woman out front said that she was leaving the shelter because she heard screams from a woman being raped in the bathroom,'' he said. ''Inside, a guard told me that the smell was from bodies stacked on the second floor.'' Soon, he said, he came across a man named Jessie with white welts covering his body and face. The man told him that when the floodwaters had come, he had climbed a tree that was swarming with fire ants. Because he could not swim, the man said, he was stuck in the tree and bitten by ants for 18 hours. The students drove him to a Baton Rouge hospital, along with three women whom they dropped at an emergency center. They then made a return trip for the women's husbands. Worried that their luck with fake press credentials was wearing out, they began their long drive back to Duke. ''We felt pretty satisfied that we got involved,'' Mr. Hankla said. ''But we all kept talking about how it was possible that three kids in a two-wheel-drive Hyundai were able to move people out of the city and the National Guard wasn't.'' IAN URBINA STORM AND CRISIS: VOICES FROM THE STORM"
"When Michael and Haley Rich evacuated their mobile home along Bayou Grand Caillou ahead of Hurricane Rita, they left by car. On Sunday, they returned by boat. The front porch had floated away. A scared kitten mewled on the raised doorstep, while a Labrador retriever sat mute on its doghouse in the flooded backyard. ''Oh, Lord, it stinks,'' Sam Roblind, a brother-in-law, said as he entered the front door to find soft spots and buckled tile in the floor, a leaky roof and ants scurrying for dry ground. ''I'm not sure they'll get that smell out of the furniture.'' Water began to retreat in the submerged low-lying bayou country of South Louisiana on Sunday, but anger welled as residents and officials of Terrebonne Parish, which includes Houma, began to survey the storm-surge damage. This is one place where Hurricane Rita was the worst recent storm; Hurricane Katrina brought only minimal wind damage to the area. As Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco toured the area and called for $20.2 billion in federal money to strengthen the levee and pumping systems along the state's inundated coastal region, she found herself preaching to a sympathetic, if waterlogged, congregation. For years, state residents and politicians have criticized what they believe is the federal government's indifference to the erosion of Louisiana's marshland and barrier islands that has lessened the state's buffer against major storms. The economy of this parish of 110,000, about 50 miles southwest of New Orleans, is driven by the fishing and oil industries. The shrimpers and oyster fishermen have endured numerous hurricanes and floods. But to a person, those here said they had never seen a nine-foot tidal surge like the one that Hurricane Rita shoved into the canals and five prominent bayous of Terrebonne Parish. ''People clean up after themselves here, so floods don't get a lot of attention,'' Iris Billiot, the sister of Ms. Rich, said as she stood along Highway 57, just beyond the pond of a front yard. ''But we need help.'' Frustration seemed to spark like downed electrical wires in the bayou communities just south of here. Emergency management and law enforcement officials complained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had yet to declare the parish a disaster area. ''FEMA? Who?'' Jerry J. Larpenter, the sheriff of Terrebonne Parish, said dismissively, echoing the complaints of many officials elsewhere after Hurricane Katrina. Michael Deroche, the parish's emergency management director, said he needed help from the agency to remove the 426 evacuees from Hurricane Katrina still housed in the local civic center. The center is now needed to shelter 916 evacuees from Hurricane Rita who are sleeping at two local schools and a recreation center, Mr. Deroche said. Sheriff Larpenter also expressed his impatience with other parish officials, who did not issue a mandatory evacuation for the 20,000 residents in the lower part of Terrebonne Parish. No deaths were reported and 3,500 residents were rescued, the sheriff said, but the toll in lives could have been significant if the hurricane had hit the parish directly. ''When you have a Category 5 hurricane, the only word should be 'mandatory,''' Sheriff Larpenter said. Along Highway 57, which runs 25 miles from here to the Gulf of Mexico, floodwater that covered the road on Saturday had receded about eight miles. National Guard troops from Arkansas moved roadblocks southward as the water retreated. But water still stood several feet in yards on both sides of the highway as residents began to return to their homes. John LeBouef, 43, a carpenter, had his mobile home on stilts, but he lost a truck and some tools. His neighbor, Heath Monroe, 31, had his camper swamped. ''Two snakes came swimming out,'' Mr. Monroe, also a carpenter, said in a tone that suggested this was no more of an annoyance than mosquitoes. ''I'm used to gators in the backyard.'' The two neighbors paddled about in pirogues, Cajun canoes, and spoke of seeing deer on a nearby levee and a couple of redfish, a saltwater variety pushed up from the gulf, swimming through the front yard. ''That's barbecue material,'' Mr. Monroe said. Cajuns here have burrowed into the bayous like mudbugs, and are famously independent and self-sufficient. Still, they appear to have grown weary of these watery confrontations with nature. The levees in Terrebonne Parish are earthen barriers designed for storm drainage, not for hurricane protection. Shrimpers, already facing depressed prices, said many processing plants were underwater. Oystermen feared that silt stirred by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita would smother the mollusks in their reefs and set the industry back two to five years. ''It's that old saying, 'You can pay me now or pay me later,''' Representative Charlie Melancon, a Democrat who represents much of the flooded area of southeast Louisiana, said of the federal government and Louisiana's request for strengthened levees. ''If they had given us the $14 billion we were asking for before Katrina, we wouldn't need $200 or $300 billion to clean up now.'' Up and down Highway 57, mobile homes and clapboard houses sat in or just above the storm surge, while flowerbeds drowned under opaque water that stood waist deep. Children played in the water by the roadside. Men sat on porches, waded or rowed between the road and their homes. Near the Intracoastal Waterway, which had overflowed its banks, Louis Phillips stood on the road with a rolling suitcase, waiting for a ride. ''We've been having this problem for the longest time, and it took something like this Katrina to hit New Orleans'' to bring national attention to the erosion of the Louisiana coastline, Mr. Phillips, 24, said. Even before he re-entered his mobile home, Mr. Rich, 24, the assistant manager of an auto parts store, said he would seek higher ground somewhere in the area. He had just spent $3,000 rebuilding the engine of his car, whose front bumper was sheered away by Hurricane Rita, the grill stuffed with marsh grass. ''We don't plan on living around here after this,'' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: LOUISIANA"
"LAST week at the Sheraton Hotel in downtown New Orleans, a mix of contractors, journalists and security people sat in the bar, reminiscing about Katrina and speculating about Rita, the storm of the moment. Hurricane coverage, for all of its discomforts, is a bit of a caper with beaucoup fringes. Reporters get to take over hotels, spend like pirates, drink like sailors and eat like truck drivers. Back at headquarters, things are grimmer. Last week, The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The San Jose Mercury News all announced significant layoffs. But the impulse to cover the big story in a big way remains. I was part of the scrum, spending last week finding the few artists and musicians remaining in New Orleans. Covering the return of music and art to a city that continues to take on water would seem to be a luxury, but it is a gesture of good faith on the part of the people I work for. Then I saw the memo about job cuts and I worried that I was part of the problem. By their disposition, hurricanes are a television story: great pictures, an informational crawl at the bottom, and a wind-swept, rain-soaked anchor. But big papers like The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal and The Los Angeles Times all dug in, sending dispatches out of New Orleans that shed light where there had been only heat. What exactly happened at the convention center? Is Mayor Ray Nagin a saint or a kook? Were the levees overtopped or undermined? Will New Orleans be a real city again, or just Disneyland with Jell-O shots? Those are not questions that get asked or answered much on television. The New Orleans story needed the big muscles of print journalism to gain custody of facts that seemed beyond comprehension. People could Google their way through the storm, but for a search engine to really work, you need women and men on the ground asking difficult questions and digging past the misinformation and panic that infect a big story. Newspapers are a civic good, especially right now, but they cannot function as a nonprofit. Make all the jokes you want about dead trees, a printed artifact that people pay to read and advertise in is an absolute necessity. On television, it always seems like Groundhog Day -- get wet, rinse, repeat. There is undeniably something compelling about Anderson Cooper standing in wind and rain in Galveston at 3 a.m. on Saturday as Rita blew ashore -- ''You feel very much at the edge of the world,'' he said, blinking against the rain -- but that does not address the issues of governance, logistics, race and class that the hurricanes reveal. Those are stories newspapers tell well. BUT with department stores consolidating both their operations and their advertising and with readers canceling the newspapers that land on their doorstep in favor of more instant gratification on the Web, big newspapers full of deep reporting and serious ambitions seem like dinosaurs at the beginning of a very cold age. Sitting on one of the last planes out of New Orleans on Friday, waiting for a break in the weather to take off, I wanted to get off, to stay and participate. But there was a new hurricane, a large ugly one, coming and many big-name reporters and anchors to chase it. The rest of us were now officially off the ball, doing broom and dustpan patrol on the aftermath, filing stories that may never see print because of the new horrors -- buses incinerating elderly passengers, poor people left behind again, and wholesale displacement -- now meriting space and attention, and rightfully so. Unfortunately, New Orleans refused to recover in time for the satellite trucks to withdraw. Assurances that the mended levees would stay that way sounded hollow when they were proffered, and the storm surge and the rain took care of that straightaway. The trash that decorates the length of Magazine Street; the mix of Humvees and television trucks that occupy the neutral ground on Canal Street; the transformation of the Ninth Ward into a wetlands, all of it serving as a reminder that some big stories have no period, only ellipses. New Orleans will be a chronic, grinding story. The French Quarter, which has served as the television backdrop for so many stories, is empty, save the drunks and lunatics at Johnny White's, a bar that never closes. The rest of the Quarter is block after block of pitch black. Is this Bourbon Street or Royal Street? Which way is the hotel? Is my flashlight running out of batteries? On Wednesday night in the midst of the gloom, at St. Louis and Royal Streets, the shadow of a figure over a big kettle appeared. Finis Shelnutt, the owner of Kelsto Club, had cooked up a huge batch of jambalaya and had a cooler of cold beer to go with it. It was a hopeful gesture, not a commercial one. ''I don't want your money,'' he said. ''I just want to know what you think of the food. Right now, I need to give back, not take.'' A group of newspaper people -- print journalists filing string that may or may not be used -- nodded their assent. For the record, the jambalaya was incredibly spicy, with a burn that provided a shock, in a good way, to the ghosts and sleepwalkers who came by to eat. Katrina and Rita have tested news media endurance. Jaded reporters looking for a quick reaction from the citizens found out quickly that you should not ask a question unless you are ready for a long, thorough answer. A random query about the geography of a neighborhood or the prospects of recovery will often prompt a soliloquy, a yarn that begins with ''the war of Yankee aggression'' and ends with what someone had for dinner the night before. Television rarely has time for all that. They want the bite short and sweet, never mind when your grandfather first arrived here. The story here defines the long tail. Race, infrastructure, class, all those things that electronic media just can't do as well, have come to the fore. Never mind that school that was wiped out but never really worked in the first place, can we see that cool graphic about Rita's landfall? I spent Friday morning parsing the gas I had and then driving to the airport through blinding rain, trying to figure out how to make the reluctant wipers on the rental car work. After parachuting in for a few stories, it felt like time to get out. If I had an excuse, I would have stayed, because this story is worth staying close to. But that would be a hopeful gesture, not a commercial one. David Carr"
"When I asked Gail Siles how the whole thing had affected her psychologically, she said, ''Don't ask me now. It's too early.'' But in a later conversation, during which she seemed on the verge of tears, she said, ''Listen, everybody's depressed and kind of still in shock. Everybody who's been through this thing. It's hard to believe it happened.'' Ms. Siles, a nurse, and her husband, Earl, a machinist, thought they had done a pretty good job preparing for the future. They expected, in a few years, to settle into the kind of comfortable, late-middle-age existence in which the heaviest lifting is picking up the grandkids. That changed a few weeks ago when, as Ms. Siles put it, ''All of a sudden water started coming through the living room.'' Unannounced, the nightmarish flood that followed Hurricane Katrina arrived at the Sileses' residence about 10 o'clock on a Monday morning. The couple lived in a brick one-story home in Chalmette, a suburb of New Orleans. The water rushed into their home so fast they couldn't even open the front door to get out. Within minutes it was up to their waists. ''We had to climb through a window,'' Ms. Siles said. Chalmette is a community of about 32,000 in St. Bernard Parish and many of its residents, including the Sileses, have boats, which are used for fishing, crabbing and other recreational activities. After climbing through the window, the Sileses slogged through the onrushing floodwaters and a pouring rain to their 17-foot Sunbird, which was parked in the carport. Only then did they realize they had left the keys in the house. Earl Siles swam back for them. While he was in the house getting the keys, the water kept rising. ''The boat was just about touching the roof of the carport,'' Ms. Siles said. ''I'm screaming for him to hurry up. Because if we got stuck under there, you know, we would have died. ''He got the keys and we got the boat going. By the time we got out of there the water was already even with the gutters on the roof. It was rainy and windy and we got about two blocks in the boat and got under the roof of the bank's drive-through. We were there about an hour and a half, then had to leave because the boat started touching the roof.'' Eventually the rain eased and the Sileses began driving their motorboat through the submerged neighborhood. Street signs and gas stations were underwater. Cars and trucks were floating by. Utility poles attached to streaming electrical wires seemed to be everywhere. ''That's when we started hearing the people hollering and screaming,'' Ms. Siles said. ''They were on their roofs, or leaning out their second-story windows, waving and screaming for help. So we just started rescuing people.'' The Sileses would haul as many people into the boat as it could hold and take them to the local high school, which had been designated as a shelter for hurricane victims. After a while they saw that other civilians, and some police officers and firefighters, were out in boats doing the same thing. ''We kept it up all day,'' Ms. Siles said. ''There were massive amounts of people, and we couldn't just leave them there. So we'd load them up. The boat was filled to capacity on each trip.'' For two days the Sileses carried people to safety in their little boat, perhaps as many as 150 people in all. Finally, exhausted and filthy, the Sileses themselves were evacuated to a shelter in Baton Rouge, where they stayed for two days. Eventually they made their way to Brooksville, Fla., where they are staying with relatives and trying, as the reality of their own dismal situation becomes clearer and clearer, to formulate the next chapter in their lives. Their home is ruined. Their jobs are gone. Ms. Siles's car and Mr. Siles's truck have been destroyed. ''If we did not have family,'' said Ms. Siles, ''we'd be living under a bridge.'' Still traumatized, and uncertain about the future, Ms. Siles is nevertheless sure of at least one thing: she will never settle again in an area that might be threatened by a hurricane or flood. ''I mean, I'm a nurse and I deal with life and death every day,'' she said. ''But once you go through something like that, you don't want to go through it again. It was like a bomb went off in your hometown.'' Op-Ed Columnist"
"Tens of thousands of evacuees began returning to Houston on Sunday and workers repaired battered levees enough to keep water from flowing into twice-flooded New Orleans, as Hurricane Rita's sputtering remnants spread up the Mississippi Valley and into the Midwest. After taking the hardest hit from the hurricane, the upper Texas coast and southwestern Louisiana began drying out on Sunday. The storm, which sent three million people in search of safer ground, left behind a wind-ravaged and waterlogged swath of land. Many in Texas, though, marveled that the damage was lighter than expected, with Gov. Rick Perry calling it ''miraculous.'' Oil prices plummeted on Sunday as damage to refineries and oil facilities along the coast also turned out to be less than had been feared. In New Orleans, the slow slog toward recovery from Hurricane Katrina, which was interrupted by Hurricane Rita, resumed as Mayor C. Ray Nagin affirmed his intention to gradually reopen drier parts of the city this week. Those districts will eventually support a population of 250,000 to 300,000, he said. Officials said the areas of New Orleans that were reflooded by Hurricane Rita could be pumped dry within a week, far sooner than originally predicted. Helicopters dropped huge sandbags into a gap in the Industrial Canal, a breach that had allowed water to flood back into the impoverished Lower Ninth Ward. In the heart of Cajun country, which was battered by Hurricane Katrina's powerful winds nearly a month ago, swamplands from Terrebonne to Vermilion Parishes were hit with 15-foot storm surges, flooding towns and ruining homes and businesses. President Bush paid the Gulf Coast another visit, less than a month after his administration drew heavy criticism for its response to Hurricane Katrina. After monitoring Hurricane Rita at the United States Northern Command in Colorado Springs, Mr. Bush on Sunday attended briefings on the government's response in San Antonio; Austin, Tex., and Baton Rouge, La. He again gave a sense of just how much the storms had affected federal disaster planning, affirming that military officials might take the lead role in planning for catastrophic storms. In Cameron Parish, which is just across the state line from Texas and caught the brunt of the storm, small towns and fishing villages were all but destroyed. The town of Cameron, population 2,000, remained under water in places on Sunday, and other towns, like Holly Beach, which has fewer than 200 residents, seemed to have disappeared. A day after the eye of Hurricane Rita passed directly over the coastal parish, pushing a storm surge forecast to be as high as 20 feet in some places, familiar landmarks were gone -- the fish camps, the store, the intersection of Highways 82 and 27 on the Gulf of Mexico. ''In Cameron, there's really hardly anything left,'' Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. ''Everything is just obliterated.'' Ms. Blanco said on Sunday that she would ask the federal government for $31.7 billion to help rebuild the state's damaged infrastructure. As the storm headed north, it was responsible for only two known deaths, a man whose mobile home was upended by a tornado in the Mississippi Delta and a man who was hit by a falling tree in Angelina County, Tex. Officials said the mass evacuation before the storm undoubtedly kept down the death toll. But 23 frail residents of a Houston living center for the elderly were killed on Friday during the evacuation, when their bus caught fire south of Dallas after more than 14 hours on the road. The authorities originally said 24 had died, but they lowered the toll on Sunday after a closer examination of the remains. On Sunday, Mr. Bush heard blunt criticism of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina along with praise for the response to the latest storm, and he promised to take what he heard back to Washington. In San Antonio, Maj. Gen. John White of the Army told the president that there had been chaos in the response to Hurricane Katrina, as when five or more helicopters responded to a rescue call for one person. ''That was a train wreck that we saw in New Orleans,'' General White said. When responding to a terrorist attack, Mr. Bush said, the Defense Department takes the lead. In the event of natural disasters ''of a certain size,'' he said, perhaps the military should also have the lead role, rather than the Department of Homeland Security and its Federal Emergency Management Agency. The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, told reporters after Sunday's briefings that the president believes ''very strongly'' that Congress should consider putting the Pentagon in charge of the response to ''extraordinary'' natural disasters. Other needs, Mr. McClellan said, included a clear line of authority after such disasters, early evacuations, better coordination of rescue efforts and more attention to ''special needs'' cases, such as older or disabled people. Returning to normalcy was a relative concept, but steps in that direction could be seen both in the places hit hardest by the two hurricanes and in areas where damage was less than feared. In Houston, traffic was heavy on many roads leading back into the city Sunday, but there was no replay of the excruciating exodus of last Thursday, which stalled thousands in traffic for 12 hours or more and left hundreds of people stranded without gasoline. ''We are seeing high traffic levels coming in, but the traffic is still flowing,'' said Judge Robert Eckels of Harris County, the top elected official there. Some delayed their return, hoping to avoid traffic. Jorge Andrade, who lives near the NASA Space Center outside Houston, said he spent 38 hours driving to Dallas on Friday afternoon and was in no rush to repeat such a trip. ''I'm leaving maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day,'' Mr. Andrade, 57, said on Sunday. ''There's just too much traffic, it's too hot, and there's not enough gasoline.'' In Houston, which the hurricane only grazed, people were out jogging under blazing heat, and many businesses had reopened, as had the airports. Garbage pickup will resume on Monday, and schools will reopen on Wednesday. ''Rita Who?'' read a sign outside Kenneally's Irish Pub on Shepherd Drive. There was far less levity in eastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana. Just outside the town of Jasper, which was hit hard by the storm, Willie Newman, 31, and several friends went out with a backhoe, a bulldozer and several chainsaws to clear about 200 downed trees from Farm-to-Market Road 777. A major problem in the area remained the lack of gasoline, power and air-conditioning. ''We're really lucky, but I don't think I could stand this heat,'' said Mr. Newman's grandmother, Verna Newman, 73. In the Louisiana town of Mouton Cove, a community of cattle ranchers, commercial fishermen and oilfield workers, Hurricane Rita produced a tidal surge that buried almost everything under four to five feet of water. When the floodwaters flowed into homes and businesses early Saturday morning, a call for volunteers and boats went out over local radio and television stations, asking residents to gather at the Abbeville Courthouse. In the middle of the town square, dozens of people lined the streets and spent the day rescuing neighbors. ''I think it's going to take a long time to get back to normal,'' said Brennan Billeaud, 23. ''But we will, I hope.'' Even in battered New Orleans, there were small signs of life and disagreements on how fast the city could begin to recover. Kelly M. Gibson, a professional golfer who has been helping with recovery efforts, burst into the Royal Sonesta Hotel around noon to deliver some of the 2,000 meals he and helpers take to law enforcement officers and rescue workers each day. He said that it was important to fortify the people working to bring the city back, but that it would be a mistake to let businesses and homeowners return too quickly. ''The roads aren't safe, there are exposed wires all over, if we rush back in it would be a total disaster,'' Mr. Gibson said. Mike Motwani echoed those sentiments as he watched workers put up plywood to replace glass broken by looters at his House of Voodoo minimart on Canal Street, one of 30 convenience stores he owns in New Orleans. He said he did not expect to reopen his stores even in the drier downtown area for 60 to 90 days. ''The workers are scattered everywhere,'' Mr. Motwani said. ''Who could work? And this is a convention city. There's not going to be business until the conventions return, and that's not going to be anytime soon.'' Saint Jones, the general manager of the Unisexxx Club on Bourbon Street, was a bit more optimistic about reopening. ''This town is full of police, military people, firemen, and they're all making plenty of overtime,'' Mr. Jones said as he applied a new coat of white paint to the front door of the club. ''We've got something they really want.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"Lovers of the rural life in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas would no doubt appreciate Baptist Vista Encampment, a rustic summer retreat on a long, winding dirt road here. But for the 150 hurricane evacuees who arrived just before dark on Monday, having been told almost nothing about where they were going or how long they would stay, the emotions were more complicated. From urban, cosmopolitan New Orleans, the evacuees came to a place that was alien to many of them and downright frightening to more than a few. Earnest church volunteers warned them not to wander into the woods, especially at night; there were bears and poisonous snakes out there, they said, and it was easy to get lost. Cicadas clicked and clattered from the tall trees. This could be home, the evacuees were told, for the next 60 days. Add culture shock to the long list of Hurricane Katrina's effects. Fifty thousand to 100,000 people, mostly from Louisiana, have made their way to Arkansas, mostly using their own resources, Gov. Mike Huckabee said in a telephone interview. About 6,000 -- the most destitute and desperate, and therefore the least able to negotiate terms about where they go next -- have been dispersed to places like Baptist Vista Encampment. Fort Chaffee, the big military base about 50 miles from here that is serving as the state's nerve center for handling the influx of evacuees, was a symbol a generation ago of the nation's response to the tens of thousands of refugees from Cuba in what became known as the Mariel boatlift. Now the base is crawling with volunteers handing out clothes, water and food, and doors and hearts have been opened by places like Baptist Vista Encampment. Volunteers said there was talk of improving the cabins to make them habitable through the winter. ''We're proud to have them and delighted we can help,'' Governor Huckabee, a Republican, said. But Betty Taylor still cried when she got off the bus in Cass and saw where fate had delivered her. By then, she had endured a night on a highway bridge in New Orleans, where her 79-year-old mother, Jessie Jones, was picked up by a rescue team and has not been heard from since. Ms. Taylor survived three nights in the New Orleans convention center and an all-night bus ride north to Fort Chaffee. She had even managed to smile through the news on Monday that up to 20,000 more evacuees were expected at Fort Chaffee, where there are beds for only 4,000; her family, which had clung together through the last week like fingers in a fist, would be moved again. Now, as the light faded and the buses pulled away from the Baptist encampment, it was all too much. ''All these trees,'' Ms. Taylor sobbed, as her husband, Ray, and her two sisters reached out to comfort her. ''It seems like hell.'' Mr. Taylor, a landscaper in New Orleans, wiped away a tear as well. ''It's scary,'' he said. Chaos has compounded the journey. The bus driver who brought the evacuees to the encampment said he did not know where the group was headed until he pulled up in front of their barracks at Fort Chaffee on Monday. He had seen the plan change at least three times. And even as the evacuees boarded, they were told that their destination was a federal Job Corps center, not a rural church camp. Some people arriving at the encampment said they felt deceived; others chalked it up to the confusion of posthurricane life. ''I think it only looks like a giant mess,'' said Rebecca H. Weber, a deputy with the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Department, who was among the evacuees arriving Monday. ''These people are really doing an amazing job.'' Some people who had not yet been shipped out of Fort Chaffee were fighting to stay because they said they feared that moving would make it harder for their families to find them. ''We're trying to avoid getting on a bus to God knows where,'' said Mario Marshall, adding that he had been trying for three days to find a way for him and a friend, Shera Lockett, to connect with relatives who had agreed to take them in. ''They're treating us like cattle.'' Mr. Huckabee said that one of his priorities in establishing a camp system, which is dominated by religious retreats like Baptist Vista Encampment, was creating a sense of order. Over the last few days, he said, a system of paid civil government has been set up for each camp, with a ''mayor'' to provide administration and a ''police chief'' to be in charge of security. The next steps, he said, include installing phone banks and offering employment services. But for now, at least, there is no way to even watch television. ''There are no antennas out here,'' said Fred A. Ernst, whose badge identified him as the constable of the encampment. ''They're working on bringing in some radios.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ARKANSAS"
"This city has no gas stations, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no hospitals and not very many people. But it does have a jail. With all the major jails in and around New Orleans closed because of flooding, the temporary lockup opened Monday in the Greyhound Bus Station on the edge of downtown. The jail will house people accused of looting and others arrested in New Orleans and surrounding cities, holding them until they can be sent to a state-run correctional center in St. Gabriel, about 70 miles northwest. There they will be arraigned and have an opportunity to make bail. ''This is a real start to rebuilding this city, this jail,'' said Burl Cain, the warden of Angola, the giant state prison in eastern Louisiana. State and local authorities worked closely to create the Greyhound jail. The Orleans Parish sheriff, Marlin Gusman, commands the lockup, but the staff is largely made up of state guards on loan from Angola, as well as a volunteers from Kentucky. In addition to armed guards from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections and the Orleans Parish sheriff's office, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Drug Enforcement Administration were at the jail, as well as two assistant United States attorneys, said Jim Letten, the United States attorney for New Orleans, who has set up an office in Baton Rouge. The main jail in Orleans Parish, a county-size area that encompasses the city of New Orleans, is still under several feet of water. The 6,000 prisoners who filled various state and local jails in the parish at the time of Hurricane Katrina have all been moved outside the city, Sheriff Gusman said. The temporary jail fills a void by giving the police a place to take the people they arrest, he said. ''We have to make it possible for the police to do their job,'' Sheriff Gusman said. ''You cannot do a thing unless you feel safe.'' Inside, the jail looks a little like a jail and a lot like a bus station. Prisoners are photographed and fingerprinted, then transferred to holding pens topped with razor wire in the lot behind the terminal. Behind the ticket counter, medics wait to handle injuries to prisoners or guards. A small handwritten sign proclaims, ''Welcome to the New Angola South.'' David R. Dugas, the United States attorney for Baton Rouge, said the temporary jail in New Orleans was being powered by ''a generator large enough to run Angola prison.'' On Monday, the jail was as hot and sticky as the rest of New Orleans, although fans kept up a steady breeze as inmates were processed by employees, including Jonalyn Cain, Mr. Cain's wife. Wearing a bulletproof vest, Ms. Cain said she would have rather been somewhere else but wanted to be near her husband. The temporary jail has 16 holding pens, each with room for about 40 prisoners and watched by a handful of shotgun-wielding guards. On Monday night, the pens were mostly empty, with fewer than 100 prisoners divided into five pens, three for women and two for men. Local authorities said Tuesday that 150 people had been arrested in recent days. Some could face federal charges. The New Orleans police are still concentrating on rescue missions and patrolling the streets and are making few arrests, so most of the prisoners came from Jefferson Parish, just west of New Orleans. They had been arrested mainly for various looting-related offenses, Sheriff Gusman said. James Thomas, of Metairie, a city just west of New Orleans, said he had been brought in after taking towels from a store. ''All my towels -- they was used up,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''I was hoping to get some towels to get a bath with.'' Another man acknowledged that he had stolen a car and protested that government officials had encouraged residents to evacuate by any means necessary. In general, the prisoners said they were satisfied with the conditions, but they said they were upset that they could not make phone calls. Several asked a reporter to notify their parents that they were alive and said they did not know how they would rebuild their lives once released. ''I lost everything,'' said one prisoner, Alphonse Douglas. ''My house, everything.'' STORMS AND CRISIS: PRISONERS"
"School districts from Maine to Washington State were enrolling thousands of students from New Orleans and other devastated Gulf Coast districts yesterday in what experts said could become the largest student resettlement in the nation's history. Schools welcoming the displaced students must not only provide classrooms, teachers and textbooks, but under the terms of President Bush's education law must also almost immediately begin to raise their scholastic achievement unless some provisions of that law are waived. Historians said that those twin challenges surpassed anything that public education had experienced since its creation after the Civil War, including disasters that devastated whole school districts, like the San Francisco earthquake and the Chicago fire. ''In terms of school systems absorbing kids whose lives and homes have been shattered, what we're going to watch over the next weeks is unprecedented in American education,'' said Jeffrey Mirel, a professor of history and education at the University of Michigan. The vast resettlement was already under way last week, with schools in Baton Rouge, La., Houston and other cities near the Gulf Coast enrolling some students. Yesterday, officials in cities including San Antonio; Phoenix; Olympia, Wash.; Freeport, Me.; Memphis; Washington; Las Vegas; Salt Lake City; Chicago; Detroit; and Philadelphia reported enrolling students or preparing for their arrival. The total number of displaced students is not yet known, but it appears to be well above 200,000. In Louisiana, 135,000 public school students and 52,000 private school students have been displaced from Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes. President Bush, speaking with reporters at the White House yesterday, thanked the nation's educators ''for reaching out and doing their duty,'' and he said that Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings was working on a plan to help states absorb the educational costs but gave no hint of what kind of assistance might be provided. The Department of Education set up a Web site to coordinate private donations to schools enrolling displaced students. ''They said we could brace for about 500 kids,'' said Sue Steele, coordinator of homeless student programs for the public schools in Wichita, where buses carrying 1,800 storm victims were expected to arrive yesterday, part of some 7,000 headed for Kansas. Many students were concentrated in districts along an arc from the Florida Panhandle west through Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas. The Santa Rosa County School District in the Florida Panhandle has enrolled 137 students, said Carol Calfee, a district official. ''And we still have folks coming in,'' she said. ''They're walking through the door and some of them just have nothing, so it's really hard.'' The local United Way has said it will try to buy school supplies for every displaced student, she said. The crisis poses new challenges for Ms. Spellings, including financial. The Department of Education's budget this year for homeless student programs is about $61 million, which she said was insufficient. Ms. Spellings, who has spent her first months in office fighting a backlash by local educators and state lawmakers against the federal law known as No Child Left Behind, is also hearing calls from advocacy groups that she take emergency measures that could be controversial. The National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, asked her on Friday to waive the accountability provisions of the law for schools in the hurricane's path as well as in Texas and other states receiving large numbers of students, a move Ms. Spellings said she was reluctant to take. Private companies that operate online courses or charter schools are urging her to use emergency powers to authorize them to enroll displaced students at the Houston Astrodome and other shelters across the nation. Ms. Spellings has invited 40 education groups, including the P.T.A. and teachers unions, to meet at the Department of Education today to discuss disaster recovery efforts. Reg Weaver, president of the N.E.A., which has challenged No Child Left Behind in federal court, said he immediately accepted the invitation. But in a separate letter, he also asked Ms. Spellings to use her powers to waive provisions of the law, which requires school districts to raise student scores on standardized tests each year by a percentage set by each state, a goal known as making adequate yearly progress. ''Until these children, their teachers, districts and families gain their footing under these extremely difficult circumstances, I encourage you to implement the provisions in N.C.L.B. that deal with the impact of natural disasters on testing and adequate yearly progress,'' Mr. Weaver's letter said. Ms. Spellings is consulting with state school superintendents as she considers whether to waive the law's accountability provisions in some cases, said her spokeswoman, Susan Aspey. One consideration is how many displaced students that individual schools or districts enroll; those with higher concentrations may be more likely to receive waivers, Ms. Aspey said. ''There is no one-size-fits-all approach,'' she said. Even before the storm, hundreds of schools that had failed to meet the federal law's proficiency requirements for several years, most of which educate the urban poor or non-English speaking immigrants, were facing sanctions that include school closings and the firing of staff. Thousands of others were expected to be placed on academic probation or labeled as low-performing. Theodore R. Sizer, a visiting professor of history at Harvard, said that unless the law's accountability provisions were waived during the emergency, they would add tensions to the resettlement crisis. ''Imagine you're the principal of a big high school in city X, and your scores are above the state minimums, so you're doing fine with the law, and suddenly you have 300 displaced kids,'' Mr. Sizer said. ''That not only brings crowding but also means that on the next exams your scores could plummet and the federal law will say you run a terrible school.'' The Bush administration must also make decisions about another hotly debated issue in public education: charter schools. The National Council of Education Providers, which represents the nation's largest commercial school management companies, has asked the Department of Education to authorize it to enroll students housed at emergency shelters in Internet-based courses offered by its companies. The National Council's Web site yesterday highlighted its request to the department to establish a ''national virtual charter school'' that would ''serve evacuees wherever they are.'' ''Once students have access to computers and connectivity -- borrowed, donated or shared -- companies are standing by to waive state restrictions and log these students on,'' the Web site said. The restrictions in question include enrollment caps in state laws that apply to charter schools. The National Council wants the federal government to waive those laws during the emergency. Jeanne Allen, a paid consultant to the National Council who is also president of the Center for Education Reform, a nonprofit organization, said she delivered a draft ''Emergency Public Charter School Act'' to members of Congress yesterday. STORM AND CRISIS: EDUCATION Correction: September 9, 2005, Friday A front-page article on Wednesday about the relocation of students from communities hit by Hurricane Katrina referred incorrectly to Theodore R. Sizer, who said that unless accountability requirements of the federal education law are waived, they will add tensions to the resettlement crisis. He is a visiting professor of education, not history, and he is affiliated with Harvard and Brandeis Universities, not just Harvard."
"While the human and economic toll of Hurricane Katrina continued to mount, New Orleans was beginning to pump back into Lake Pontchartrain the floodwaters that had inundated the city. But this is not the same water that flooded the city. What started flowing back into the lake on Monday and continued spilling into it Tuesday is laced with raw sewage, bacteria, heavy metals, pesticides and toxic chemicals, Louisiana officials said on Tuesday. Whether or not the accelerating pumping of this brew from city streets into coastal waters poses a threat to the ecosystems and fisheries in the brackish bay remains to be seen, the officials said. They added that they could do little more than keep testing and count on the restorative capacity of nature to break down or bury contaminants. Though the state of the lake was a prime issue, it was just one of a host of problems identified in the storm-ravaged region on Tuesday by Louisiana and federal environmental officials. For example, the officials said that although two large oil spills, from damaged storage tanks, were under control, thousands of other smaller spills continued to coat floodwaters in New Orleans with a rainbow sheen. The first samples of the city's floodwaters were taken on Saturday by the Environmental Protection Agency, and results were expected later in the week, officials said. ''It's simply unfeasible'' to try and hold the pumped water somewhere to filter out pollution, said Michael D. McDaniel, the Louisiana secretary of environmental quality. ''We have to get the water out of the city or the nightmare only gets worse,'' said Dr. McDaniel, who is a biologist. ''We can't even get in to save people's lives. How can you put any filtration in place?'' Some scientists outside government tended to agree that the risk of long-term damage to the coastal waters was not high. One reason is that the lake is fed by several rivers and flushed by tides through its link to the Gulf of Mexico. There will probably be an ''initial toxic slug'' entering the lake but that will be diluted and degraded by bacteria, said Frank T. Manheim, a former geochemist for the United States Geological Survey who teaches at George Mason University and was a co-author of a 2002 report on pollution issues in the lake. ''I think the lake has withstood has some big hits,'' he said, including an oxygen-sapping algae bloom after a 1997 flood. He said that most of the long-lived industrial pollutants that can accumulate in organisms and work their way up the food chain have largely been phased out. Overall, though, it was becoming evident that just the flooding of New Orleans had created environmental problems that could take years to resolve, state officials said. Each of the estimated 140,000 to 160,000 homes that were submerged is a potential source of fuel, cleaners, pesticides and other potentially hazardous materials found in garages or under kitchen sinks, officials said. The E.P.A. on Tuesday estimated that more than 200 sewage treatment plants in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were affected, with almost all of the plants around New Orleans knocked out of action. Hundreds of small manufacturers or other businesses using chemicals or fuels, many with storage tanks held in place by gravity instead of bolts, are probably leaking various chemicals and oils, officials and independent experts said. The E.P.A. and the Department of Health and Human Services issued a joint statement on Tuesday warning people that ''every effort should be made to limit contact with floodwater because of potentially elevated levels of contamination associated with raw sewage and other hazardous substances.'' The statement urged anyone exposed to the water to wash thoroughly with soap and water and alert medical personnel about open cuts. ''Early symptoms from exposure to contaminated flood water may include upset stomach, intestinal problems, headache and other flu-like discomfort,'' the statement said. Officials pointed to a short list of developments they called encouraging: the two largest known oil spills were declared under control, with one slick drifting out into the Gulf of Mexico and away from the state's ravaged coastline, where it will probably degrade over time. As for the lake, ''The wonderful thing about nature is its resilience,'' Dr. McDaniel said. ''The bacterial contaminants will not last a long time in the lake. They actually die off pretty fast. The organic material will degrade with natural processes. Metals will probably fall and be captured in the sediments. Nature does a good job. It just takes awhile.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ENVIRONMENT"
"Last week came the rumors -- of riots at Wal-Marts, of break-ins at homes, of drug gangs from New Orleans roaming the streets of its more sedate neighbor 75 miles up Interstate 10. Today came the reality -- of a dozen or more relatives crowded under one roof, of hours stuck in traffic trying to get to school or work, of frustration and fear about what kind of city Baton Rouge will be with at least 100,000 evacuees and rescue workers added to the 227,000 residents it had before the storm hit. Make no mistake. The overwhelming response of people in Baton Rouge to Hurricane Katrina has been one of compassion and sacrifice with every church in town, it seems, housing or feeding evacuees. But there have also been runs on gun stores, mounting frustration over gridlocked roads and an undercurrent of fear about crime and the effect of the evacuees. After the chaos of the storm, which did some damage here, and a long weekend, Tuesday was the first day most residents returned to work and school. Before the evacuation, blacks made up about half the population of Baton Rouge and almost 70 percent of New Orleans, and in conversations in which race is often explicit or just below the surface, voices on the street, in shops, and especially in the anonymous hothouse of talk radio were raising a new question: just how compassionate can this community, almost certainly home to more evacuees than any other, afford to be? ''You can't take the city out of the yat, and you can't take the yat out of the city,'' said Frank Searle, a longtime Baton Rouge resident, using a slang term for New Orleanians derived from the local greeting, ''Where y'at?'' ''These people will not assimilate here,'' Mr. Searle said. ''They put up with the crime in New Orleans, and now it's staring them in the face, but up here that's not going to be tolerated. People are going to handle it individually if they have to. This is the South. We will take care of it.'' For a week Baton Rouge, the state capital, home of Louisiana State University and a place that sees itself as a less raucous cousin to what had been the kingdom of sin and merriment to its south, has been trying to come to terms with its sudden status as the state's most populous city. ''It's a new Baton Rouge we're living in, isn't it?'' said Jeanine Smallwood of suburban Prairieville, in the middle of a 90-minute drive to work that should have taken 20. Like many people in and near Baton Rouge, Mrs. Smallwood, her 1,700-square-foot house now sheltering 14 people, is trying to balance the need for compassion with the vertigo of a changed city. And so while she wishes all the evacuees well, she said she feared an influx of people from the housing projects of New Orleans, places, she has heard, where people walk around in T-shirts that read, ''Kill the cops.'' ''Or so the story has it,'' she said. ''Those aren't neighborhoods I go to.'' She was so rattled, she said, she told her daughter she might have to move. On reflection, she said, there is little chance of that. Instead, she is hoping for the best. ''People are, what's the word? Not frustrated, not scared, it's more like their lives are on hold, everything's changed and we're trying to figure out what the new normal is going to be,'' Mrs. Smallwood said. Many relief workers and volunteers say the worries over crime reflect more wholesale stereotyping of people fleeing a catastrophe than anything based in fact, but safety is a major issue. At the height of the post-storm panic last week, people waited in line for three and a half hours at Jim's Firearms, a giant gun and sporting goods store. Many were people from New Orleans with their own safety issues. But many were local residents jumpy about the newcomers from New Orleans and stocking up on Glock and Smith & Wesson handguns. Jim Siegmund, a salesman at Jim's recently returned from military service in Iraq, said he did not think there was anything to worry about. Still, holding a cellphone in his hand and comparing it to a 9-millimeter handgun he said: ''When push comes to shove, this won't protect you, but a Glock 9 will.'' Joel Phillips, a 38-year-old contractor, said he had never owned a gun in his life, but after watching an angry argument at a gas station, he stood in line for three hours at Jim's to buy a 9-millimeter Ruger handgun and then went with a friend to a firing range over the weekend to learn how to use it. ''I have two daughters, I sometimes have to work in bad neighborhoods,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''I probably don't need it, but I'll feel better knowing that I have some protection.'' Many evacuees are staying with family or friends, their campers, S.U.V.'s and pickups parked on front lawns or circular driveways. Most people at the broad array of shelters were dazed but appreciative of the help from local volunteers like the Louisiana State University students, upbeat and attentive, tending to sick and exhausted evacuees at the triage center on campus. But others, particularly those at the main Red Cross shelter at the River Center convention center downtown, were seething with frustration, not just over the disaster they were fleeing, but from the sense that they were being treated not so much like guests as people being warehoused until they could be shipped elsewhere. Patricia Perry, a postal employee from New Orleans, said anyone with a wristband from the River Center shelter was being stereotyped outside it as one of ''those people'' -- looters, criminals, outcasts. ''It's like a stigma,'' she said. ''All they really want to do is get us out of town. Well, I'm from Louisiana. I work hard. I pay my taxes. Surely, this state can find a place for us to live.'' Still, many residents, with the sense of intimacy that remains so much a part of Southern life, took their role as hosts seriously, as if it would be bad manners, the ultimate sin in the South, to do otherwise. So when Pam Robertson, manager of a convenience store, asked a customer how he was doing, it was not dutiful chatter but a real question that begged for a real answer. When it came, she took the man's hand in hers over the counter and talked about her friend Hunter, evacuated from Loyola University, about her upbringing in the town of Henderson in the heart of Cajun country, about the grid of local streets here. She greeted one and all with the same missionary zeal, as if the right words could somehow undo the disaster of the past week. And when asked how she was doing, or even when they didn't, she replied: ''I'm tired, but I'm hanging in. It's good. It's all good. God is good. We'll get through it.'' STORM AND CRISIS: BATON ROUGE"
"Under relentless political fire over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush on Tuesday tried to steer the public debate toward progress in the region, promising to investigate earlier stumbles, as anxious lawmakers returned to the Capitol pledging inquiries of their own and aid money for the storm victims. Mr. Bush, in a flurry of meetings at the White House, said he would dispatch Vice President Dick Cheney to the Gulf Coast this week to cut through any bureaucratic obstacles slowing recovery efforts. Members of Congress demanded answers and awaited a new emergency spending measure from the White House, calculating the growing cost of the recovery at $50 billion, if not more than twice that. Fresh from their summer recess, lawmakers questioned the effectiveness of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pledged to hold hearings and possibly enact legislation to address the failures in the response system. ''It is difficult to understand the lack of preparedness and the ineffective initial response to a disaster that had been predicted for years and for which specific dire warnings had been given for days,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which will conduct one of the main inquiries. There will be at least two sets of Congressional hearings, leaders said, beginning as early as next week, to examine issues like failures in the command and control structure, shortcomings in the evacuation plan for New Orleans, and any organizational problems that may have contributed to the slow response. The hearings will also address whether the government missed critical opportunities to shore up the levees in New Orleans and whether planning for future disasters is sufficient. Lawmakers, at least in the Senate, said it would be too early to consider whether Mr. Bush would be called to testify. For the first time since the hurricane hit, Mr. Bush met with leaders from both parties, capping a day of constant political attention to a crisis that has exposed fault lines within the Republican Party and threatens to overtake the entire Congressional agenda. Mr. Bush promised to lead an investigation into what went wrong, although a White House spokesman quickly qualified the statement, saying the inquiry would come later to avoid diverting resources from the recovery efforts. Mr. Bush also resisted renewed calls to fire Michael D. Brown, the director of FEMA, who became a lightning rod for attacks last week when he said he was unaware of a crisis at the New Orleans convention center, news of which had been televised for days. Instead, Mr. Bush accused critics of playing the ''blame game'' and said he would remain focused on the immediate crisis as evacuees fanned out across the country. ''We've got to solve problems; we're problem-solvers,'' he said. ''There will be ample time for people to figure out what went right and what went wrong. What I'm interested in is helping save lives.'' At issue in the immediate future is the amount of money the government will allocate for the recovery and reconstruction efforts. Mr. Bush signed a $10.5 billion spending measure last Friday, and Congressional leaders said they expected to receive a $40 billion to $50 billion supplemental spending request this week. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said the total bill could reach $150 billion, further squeezing a budget constrained by the nearly $5 billion spent each month on the Iraq war and the $333 billion federal deficit. The $150 billion projection was quickly disputed by Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican leader, who suggested that Mr. Reid was ''playing politics'' by giving that figure when no official projections were available. But White House officials have not disputed estimates in the tens of billions of dollars. Senior administration officials rejected accusations that the federal government had been slow to respond, detailing progress on the military, education and social services fronts. Mr. Bush, after meeting with Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, said the administration was reviewing ways to help states like Texas absorb the costs of accommodating thousands of children of evacuees in their public school systems. At the Pentagon, senior officials pointed to the arrival of forces in the Gulf Coast in recent days, with more than 41,000 National Guardsmen and about 17,000 active-duty personnel committed to the mission. Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, praised what he described as a more than adequate military response. ''Not only was there no delay, I think we anticipated, in most cases -- not in all cases -- but in most cases, the support that was required,'' General Myers said at a news briefing. ''And we were pushing support before we were formally asked for it.'' Even so, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he had ordered the military to conduct a ''lessons learned'' study on the armed forces' response to the hurricane to determine whether it could have been more timely. And Mr. Bush, in the first of several hurricane-related events throughout the day, made an unexpected pledge to personally lead an inquiry into earlier failures. ''What I intend to do is lead a -- to lead an investigation to find out what went right and what went wrong,'' Mr. Bush, after meeting with his cabinet, said in response to a question about who would be held accountable. ''And I'll tell you why,'' he continued. ''It's very important for us to understand the relationship between the federal government, the state government and the local government when it comes to a major catastrophe. And the reason it's important is, is that we still live in an unsettled world.'' Pressed for details about the investigation, Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said it would not begin until the immediate crisis had passed. Describing it as an ''analysis,'' not an investigation, Mr. McClellan would not say whether the emergency failures would be examined by an independent commission, as the Sept. 11 attacks were, or even when the president wanted the process to start. ''There will be a time to do a thorough analysis,'' Mr. McClellan said. ''Now is not the time to do that.'' Instead, Congress appeared poised to take the lead. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said she was introducing legislation to create an independent commission. Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Government Reform Committee, said his panel would begin hearings on the government response, a move that came after Senate leaders had announced their own plans for hearings and that appeared to catch House leaders off guard. ''We are going to look at Mr. Davis's hearing,'' said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois. ''What we don't want to have happen is that the people who are on the ground in the Gulf States have to come up here and talk to 13 or 14 different groups.'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who will help lead the Senate investigation with Ms. Collins, said the federal response to Hurricane Katrina had shaken the public's confidence in the ability of the government to protect them. ''Hurricane Katrina was in one sense the most significant test of the new national emergency preparedness and response system that was created after 9/11, and it obviously did not pass that test,'' Mr. Lieberman said. Some Republican lawmakers said they had tried to impress upon their party's leaders what they believe are the political risks involved in the disaster response, fearing that Republicans have exposed themselves to significant political risk in next year's elections by having appeared not to take the hurricane and its aftermath seriously at first. Already, the hurricane has upended the fall legislative agenda. Leaders of both the House and the Senate have said their chief mission in the coming weeks would be to provide relief to storm victims and begin rebuilding devastated communities. Under pressure from Democrats, the Senate postponed a vote on a proposal to eliminate the estate tax, while House officials said they expected to delay a budget bill that would require cuts in health care and education. STORM AND CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT"
"Speaking at a Florida university last year, Michael D. Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, recalled his small-town Oklahoma upbringing and offered advice he said few graduation speakers would offer. ''Everything in life is not perfect,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Expect to make those mistakes. Expect to fall down every now and then. And expect to occasionally fail at something.'' Mr. Brown may be calling on those maxims himself today, in his second week as on-the-ground manager of the largest disaster response in American history. He has faced two simultaneous challenges -- coordinating 14 federal agencies with state and local counterparts under grueling conditions, and fending off criticism from those who say that FEMA has failed and put the blame squarely on him. By all accounts, it was not experience in managing disasters that brought Mr. Brown, 50, a lawyer from Oklahoma, to FEMA in 2001 as general counsel. It was his 30-year friendship with Joe M. Allbaugh, who managed President Bush's 2000 presidential campaign and became his first director of the emergency agency.. But when pressed yet again to give his qualifications at a news conference on Monday, Mr. Brown gave a practiced answer, running through his learning curve as general counsel, then deputy director and finally, since 2003, director of FEMA. He has overseen the response to 164 presidentially declared disasters, he said, including California wildfires, a rash of tornadoes in the Midwest several years ago and the four Florida hurricanes last year. ''So, yes,'' he said, ''I've been through a few disasters in my life.'' Mr. Brown's spokeswoman, Natalie Rule, added on Tuesday that he oversaw an agency with a lot of experience in disaster management. ''What you need is what he is -- a leader who can manage budget, personnel and policy.'' Nonetheless, Mr. Brown has been a hands-on manager, trudging through each new scene of devastation dispensing aid and encouragement. Since Hurricane Katrina, he has been a constant presence on television, rattling off statistics on people rescued and meals delivered. But he stunned several national television interviewers last week with the admission that he did not know about the 20,000 evacuees at the convention center in New Orleans until Thursday, 24 hours after it was featured in news reports. Senator Mary L. Landrieu offered a devastating critique on Friday in Baton Rouge. ''I have been telling him from the moment he arrived about the urgency of the situation,'' she said. ''I just have to tell you that he had a difficult time understanding the enormity of the task before us.'' Since then, the news for Mr. Brown has not gotten better. The Times-Picayune, Louisiana's largest newspaper, asked Mr. Bush in an open letter to clean house at FEMA, calling ''especially'' for the ouster of Mr. Brown. On Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff placed the Coast Guard's chief of staff, Vice Admiral Thad W. Allen, in charge of the New Orleans relief effort, clearly a move to beef up management where the problems have been most severe. And on Tuesday, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, in calling for FEMA to be made a separate cabinet-level agency, said its director should have emergency management experience. Mr. Brown's friends say they have cringed watching the criticism of a man they describe as compassionate and dedicated to difficult work. Mary Ann Karns, who worked as city attorney in Edmond, Okla., in the 1970's when Mr. Brown was her assistant, said, ''He was interested in politics not for glory and not for power, but because he wanted to make things better for people.'' Michael DeWayne Brown was born on Nov. 11, 1954 in Guymon, Okla. He and his wife, Tamara, have two grown children, Jared and Amy. His friends say he is an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, an avid hiker and fly fisherman, and a collector of antique maps of the West. In addition to his brief experience as a city official, Mr. Brown has practiced law, worked for the Oklahoma State Senate and served as counsel to an insurance company. He lost a race for Congress in 1988. But the job he did for a decade before joining FEMA is curiously omitted from his online agency résumé. From 1991 to 2001, as commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association, Mr. Brown enforced the rules administered by judges at the association's 300 annual horse shows. His decisions provoked a number of lawsuits, including one from David Boggs, a trainer whom Mr. Brown accused of having cosmetic surgery performed on horses. Mr. Brown's critics in the horse world say he was forced to resign in January 2001 because association officers were upset that he had accepted donations to a personal legal defense fund. But Andy Lester, a friend of Mr. Brown's and his lawyer, said that his departure was ''negotiated'' and that there was no wrongdoing. An ethics review panel upheld the charges against Mr. Boggs and suspended him for five years. Mr. Lester said that Mr. Brown showed backbone in pursuing the charges despite the controversy that erupted in the horse industry. ''He did not fold under pressure,'' Mr. Lester said. By 2001, Mr. Brown was tired of the uproar and was ready to move on, said Tom Connelly, the president of the horse association at the time. He had often spoken of the possibility of a Washington job should Mr. Bush become president, Mr. Connelly recalled. ''What has surprised me is that he rose to the position he has now so quickly,'' Mr. Connelly said. ''But when he started with the association, he didn't know horses. And he caught up in a hurry.'' Man in the News"
"Before the sun came up on Tuesday morning, Elejaine Gobert had her five children scrubbed and dressed in white shirts just like those they wore for school back in Mississippi, before Hurricane Katrina ripped up their lives. The school-day routine was a welcome relief after a chaotic escape from the storm and a week in the Red Cross shelter behind St. Peter Claver Catholic Church in the northeast corner of Houston. There was little for the children to do during the day at the shelter, and Ms. Gobert was insistent that their schooling continue, despite their having lost everything in the storm. ''That's the most important thing,'' said Ms. Gobert, who said she was a nurse. ''They don't need to be here all day depressed at the shelter. Back at home, they love school.'' Just after 7 a.m., a bus from the North Forest Independent School District pulled into the church lot to pick up Ms. Gobert's five youngsters and the three children of Webb and Theresa Pierce, who fled to Houston from Marrero, La., just ahead of the hurricane. As an orange sun rose, off they rode to a new school, new teachers and new classmates in a scene that played out thousands of times in Texas alone on Tuesday morning, as the storm-tossed clung to the one constant raft in their lives. Texas school officials said they could not provide a complete count of children of the storm now enrolled statewide; their latest estimate, at the end of last week, was 6,100. That number is expected to soar this week, as school officials enter the large shelters at the Astrodome and two large convention centers in Houston to begin registering school-age children. Terry Abbott, spokesman for the Houston Independent School District, which will absorb the largest number of storm evacuees, said the district expected to sign up at least 5,000 children from those shelters. In addition, he said, several thousand students now staying in hotels, outlying shelters or in private homes will enter the Houston school district in coming days. The Houston district, the state's largest, can accommodate as many as 13,000 new students, Mr. Abbott said. The district has already decided to reopen two elementary schools that were closed last spring because of declining enrollment and plans to hire hundreds of teachers. Among the new hires, Mr. Abbott said, are dozens from Louisiana, and scores who were in the applicant pool in Houston last spring. The influx of students will be another big challenge for Houston, which trumpets its school district as one of the most successful in the nation, with a high rate of achievement under President Bush's education law, the No Child Left Behind Act. But last year, the system was found to have vastly underreported its dropout rate and manipulated its 10th-grade test scores. The State of Texas has suspended its required ratio of one teacher for every 22 students and waived immunization requirements for displaced students, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency said. The state will also reimburse all costs, including those for free breakfasts and lunches, for districts that take in more than 50 new students. In Dallas, school buses picked up about 150 children from downtown shelters on Tuesday and delivered them to schools in the city. As the buses pulled up, many children eagerly clambered on board. ''Some of them jumped for joy,'' said Ivette Cruz Weis, a spokeswoman for the Dallas Independent School District. ''They were so ready'' after a week sitting around the shelters, she added. At A.G. Hilliard Elementary School in northeast Houston, four of Ms. Gobert's children and the three Pierce youngsters were assigned to classes based on what grade they said they had been in back home. The eldest of the group, John Gobert, 15, was assigned to a magnet high school because he is a ballet dancer. The leader of Hilliard's second-grade teaching team, Erica Chandler, took Nashia Gobert, 7, by the hand and showed her to a locker. Nashia slipped off her empty Nickelodeon backpack (obviously a donated item, because it had the name Leslee Ivy in bold letters on it) and lined up for breakfast, a carton of Golden Grahams and a half-pint of 2 percent milk. ''These kids are amazing,'' Ms. Chandler said after she had placed Nashia in a classroom. ''I thought they'd be a little upset, a little distraught. But they talk about what they went through just like adults.'' Ms. Chandler said she took several of her other storm-displaced students to a Jack in the Box restaurant over the weekend and broke down crying at the stories they told. One girl, Gabriel Santiago, had deep bruises on her side from sleeping jammed against a pole at the Superdome in New Orleans, where her family was huddled on the concrete floor. Ms. Chandler said the girl said to her, ''I told my mom, why are you complaining? We're still alive.'' ''They show no signs of what they went through,'' Ms. Chandler said. ''They're not despondent and they're not acting out in any way.'' Sharon Wyckoff described herself as the ''principal, cook and custodian'' at Hilliard Elementary, which has more than 500 pupils. The school has taken in 22 evacuees. One thing she wanted to do, she said, was to find them red shirts and blue pants, the school uniform, so they feel a part of the community. School guidance counselors say that the shock of relocation and sudden placement in an unfamiliar school are bound to affect many of the children. The president of the Texas Counseling Association, Sadie Woodard, said youngsters were as susceptible to post-traumatic stress symptoms as adults. She said she expected to see anger and aggressive acts, depression, difficulty concentrating and other signs of trauma as thousands of new students poured into Texas schools in coming weeks. ''This is going to present a number of different counseling problems,'' said Ms. Woodard, who is also the assistant superintendent for guidance counseling at the 85,000-student Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District in northwest Houston. ''They've been displaced from their homes, living in shelters; they have to adjust to that,'' she said. ''They are going to a school where they don't know anyone. In many cases they waded through deep water and saw dead bodies and lost their homes and everything they had. It's going to cause all kinds of emotional responses.'' Ms. Woodard said that 400 evacuated children were now enrolled in her district and that she expected a couple hundred more. Each has met with a counselor and has been encouraged to recount his or her experiences in the disaster. The older children are being assigned a fellow student to help show them the ropes. ''When they came here, they were tired, hungry, frustrated and in shock,'' she said. ''Once they get through that phase, there will be other problems to address.'' She added, ''These kiddos are going to need support for a very long time.'' STORM AND CRISIS: STUDENTS"
"Some New York City police officers who arrived here over the last few days were serving on the front lines of a national crisis for a second time. They had been there, too, when the attack on the World Trade Center, a man-made disaster, took the lives of 23 members of their department. The New York police volunteers arrived in caravans only a few days before the fourth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack and set out, often without sleep, on search-and-rescue, security, evacuation and patrol missions. To exhausted police and emergency crews in Louisiana, they are an army of relief, their numbers and discipline providing steady hands in a challenging situation. By Tuesday afternoon, there were 303 New York officers, the largest deployment outside the city in the department's history, said Thomas Reppetto, a police historian who helped write ''NYPD: A City and Its Police,'' (Henry Holt, 2000). They are working mainly around New Orleans, but some members of the department's elite Emergency Service Unit are working in Hancock, Miss., near Biloxi, where 500 houses were blown off their foundations. One of their jobs there is to slog through eight-inch-thick mud and cover bodies with tarps so they can be picked up later. Those who remember the 2001 attacks said the devastation they faced this time was much different. ''We were in a 16-acre disaster zone that went for 10 or 12 blocks,'' said Inspector Thomas Graham, a 33-year veteran who commands the Disorder Control Unit, based in the Bronx. ''Here, there is no water,'' Inspector Graham said. ''There is no electricity. I've got my people housed in a nursing home. There's not enough water pressure to take a shower. And the death toll, I think, is going to be more severe. ''We had a toxic stew because of the fires and the dust,'' he continued. ''Their toxic stew is you cannot drink any water from the tap, because of the pollution, because of the dead bodies in the canals.'' Some of the first New York officers to arrive were quickly put to work on Sunday helping provide transportation for National Guard troops who were moving into New Orleans. On Tuesday, some were dispatched west of the city. Many of the officers have military experience. Others sent south were chosen because they had expertise in large search-and-rescue operations or building collapses. When they think back on Sept. 11, Inspector Graham and many others who arrived from New York remember especially that officers from New Orleans were among the first to join them at ground zero. ''They were there in the first 24 to 48 hours,'' Inspector Graham said. ''Not our request, they just came. They got on a bus and headed up. During 9/11 they were cooking gumbo and feeding us. So, when we got a request for Jefferson Parish, I think that is one of the reasons we came.'' With more than 2,000 additional officers having volunteered from station houses around New York's five boroughs and the relief effort entering a longer, more grueling phase, more officers from the city may be on the way, officials said, raising questions about whether New York could afford to give up that many officers, even temporarily. New York's police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, has characterized his department's effort as one small way to pay back the nation for all the help it received after Sept. 11. And police officials pointed out that while 303 officers from New York represented less than 1 percent of the department's 38,000 officers, they represented about 20 percent of New Orleans's 1,500-member force. In addition, a significant number of officers in New Orleans have resigned or abandoned the force, others are unaccounted for, and two have committed suicide in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The New York officers are working under an agreement with Louisiana that gives them full law-enforcement authority. State and local officials outline the mission and determine where the New York officers are most needed. In smaller areas, like Jefferson Parish and Harahan, calls are being dispatched by local police departments and communicated to the New York officers, who are supervised by their own commanders, including two inspectors, an assistant chief, several captains, lieutenants and sergeants. ''Right now the chain of command is what it normally is in the N.Y.P.D.,'' said the department's chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne. ''At the higher level we get guidance as to how they want us deployed. And their supervisory people are in with our sergeants so they can have joint face-to-face communication out on patrols.'' Inspector Graham said officers had ''started to create our own radio network,'' using a repeater on a truck, to get up to 10 miles of coverage and help cope with spotty cellphone service. Through it all, he said, residents have been ''lovely to us, happy to see us.'' STORM AND CRISIS: LAW ENFORCEMENT"
"Hurricane Katrina is about to blow a hole in the federal budget, and it is already jeopardizing President Bush's agenda for cutting taxes and reducing the deficit. Administration officials told Republican lawmakers on Tuesday that relief efforts were running close to $700 million a day, and that the total federal cost could reach as high as $100 billion. That would be many times the cost of any other natural disaster or even the $21 billion that was allocated for New York City after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The expenses would come just as Mr. Bush and Republican leaders are trying to push through spending cuts for programs like Medicaid and student loans, extend about $70 billion in expiring tax cuts, and reduce the federal budget deficit. ''There is no question but that the costs of this are going to exceed the costs of New York City after 9/11 by a significant multiple,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. White House officials are planning to ask Congress as early as Wednesday for a second round of emergency financing, perhaps as much as $40 billion, but they said even that would be a ''stopgap'' measure while they assessed the full costs. Though it is still too early for accurate estimates, the costs are all but certain to wreak havoc with Mr. Bush's plans to reduce the federal deficit and possibly his plans to extend tax cuts. On Monday, the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, postponed plans to push for a vote on repealing the estate tax, a move that would benefit the wealthiest 1 percent of households, costing more than $70 billion a year once fully put in effect. House and Senate leaders are also grappling with their pre-hurricane plan to propose $35 billion in spending cuts over the next five years for entitlement programs like Medicaid, student loans, food stamps and welfare payments. Those cuts could suddenly prove politically unpalatable to Mr. Bush and Republican lawmakers, who are trying to rebuff criticism that the federal government shortchanged the hurricane's poorest victims. Congressional Democrats are already using the hurricane as a reason to block Republican tax and spending plans. ''Democrats think this is the worst possible time to be cutting taxes for those at the very top and cutting the social safety net of those at the very bottom, and adding $35 billion,'' said Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for Democrats on the House Budget Committee. Budget analysts said the magnitude and unique characteristics of the hurricane made it unlike any previous natural disaster, resulting in a variety of extraordinary costs: Shelter for as many as a million people for months. A potentially high share of uninsured property losses that stem from flooding, which is not covered by private insurers. Education and health care for hundreds of thousands forced to live outside their home states. ''Katrina could easily become a milestone in the history of the federal budget,'' said Stanley Collender, a longtime budget analyst here. ''Policies that never would have been considered before could now become standard.'' Indeed, there were signs on Tuesday that Republicans and Democrats had already begun to compete with each other over who might be willing to spend more. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, predicted on Tuesday that costs could total $150 billion. Top Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have begun to call for ''stimulus'' measures to buck up the overall economy. White House officials contend that costs attributable to the hurricane are separate from Mr. Bush's underlying budget goals, which include cutting the deficit in half over the next four years and permanently extending most of the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. Budget analysts also note that natural disasters are essentially one-time costs that do not affect the government's long-run fiscal health. ''We can afford $100 billion -- one time,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''What we cannot afford is $100 billion in additional spending year after year.'' The problem is that, even without the hurricane, the federal government's underlying fiscal health is in poor shape. In July, the White House predicted that surging tax revenues would reduce the deficit this year to $333 billion from $412 billion in 2004. But many analysts believe that the tax surge was largely a one-time event and that overall government spending is still poised to climb rapidly as a result of the war in Iraq, the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the growing number of baby boomers who will soon reach retirement age. Before the hurricane, House and Senate Republicans were preparing to work out $35 billion in spending cuts over the next five years that would trim Medicaid payments by $10 billion and make smaller cuts in student loan programs, farm programs, food stamps, housing and cash assistance to poor families. Under the budget resolution that Congress passed this spring, Congressional committees are supposed to spell out the proposed cuts by Sept. 16. House and Senate leaders had been planning to pass the cuts within a week or so after that. STORM AND CRISIS: COSTS Correction: September 8, 2005, Thursday An article yesterday about the financial impact of Hurricane Katrina on the federal budget omitted the last three words of a quotation from Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for Democrats on the House Budget Committee. He said, ''Democrats think this is the worst possible time to be cutting taxes for those at the very top and cutting the social safety net for those at the very bottom, adding $35 billion to the deficit.''"
"In her 19 years, all spent living in downtown New Orleans, Chavon Allen had never ventured farther than her bus fare would allow, and that was one trip last year to Baton Rouge. But now that she has seen Houston, she is planning to stay. ''This is a whole new beginning, a whole new start. I mean, why pass up a good opportunity, to go back to something that you know has problems?'' asked Ms. Allen, who had been earning $5.15 an hour serving chicken in a Popeyes restaurant. For Daphne Barconey, Hurricane Katrina disrupted plans for a grand house to be built on a $150,000 lot that she bought in eastern New Orleans just months ago. Now, just eight days after the storm, she has a job in a hospital here, a year's lease on a four-bedroom apartment near the Galleria mall and no plan to return to New Orleans. Jason Magee is a golf pro who says now is the time to move away from his native New Orleans. ''I had been looking for an excuse to leave, and this is it,'' he said. From across the economic spectrum, whether with heavy hearts or with optimism, the hundreds of thousands of people who fled the wrath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans are already putting down roots in new cities. If even a fraction of them decide not to return, the migration threatens a population crash that could be nearly as devastating to the New Orleans area as the storm itself. And city officials know it. After days of asking, then demanding, now practically begging the residents of New Orleans to leave, they have mentally if not publicly changed gears and are devising strategy behind the scenes about how they will accomplish a titanic shift -- in effect, a reverse evacuation. Since its population peaked at almost 630,000 in 1960, New Orleans has been steadily losing its people. According to the last census, 445,000 people lived there. But a trickle of people over the decades is quite a different matter from what the city now faces, a sudden population bust that could subtract up to 250,000 people. ''I look at the situation, and it brings fear,'' said Rodney Braxton, the city's chief legislative lobbyist. ''If there's one thing that gives me sorrow beyond the loss of life, it's that.'' Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, head of the department of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, underscored the size of the problem. ''If a big chunk of the population doesn't come back, it's going to be horrific for the city,'' she said. In Houston alone, close to 1,200 evacuees moved on Tuesday from the Astrodome into apartments with six-month leases. ''We know that with each passing day it's going to be harder to bring them back,'' Mr. Braxton said. ''But we are going to fight for them.'' So far, that fight is only in its infancy, but the first phase is already taking shape. Kenya Smith, the city's chief of intergovernmental relations, said city leaders intended to establish New Orleans-run centers in every area where large numbers of evacuees were known to be living. The centers would be clearinghouses for information, providing neighborhood-by-neighborhood details about floodwaters and cleanup efforts, utilities and phone service. The centers would also function as registration sites, to keep track of who is where. The city intends to establish a toll-free number providing daily updates on information like the condition of the streets and giving residents opportunities to communicate with city officials. Beyond that, Mr. Smith said, plans will have to be tailored to the different segments of society. ''Large pockets of our people will not have the means to travel great distances to get back, so we know we will have to help with that,'' Mr. Smith said. Incentives are being discussed for evacuees who were better off. ''We intend to make it as easy as possible and to give them something to come home to,'' Mr. Braxton said, emphasizing the importance of improved infrastructure and storm protections. ''There will have to be some creative legislation and ideas.'' Mr. Magee, the golfer, says the storm will change the city's demographics. ''The middle class is dislodged now, and in six months, they're going to have to have a really compelling reason to move,'' he said. Some people faithful to New Orleans will return no matter what. Glen Andrews, a jazz trombonist staying in the Astrodome, on Tuesday echoed the words of Fats Domino, a New Orleans native. ''I'm going home even if it comes down to walking to New Orleans,'' Mr. Andrews said. ''It's my life, and I prefer to be in Louisiana, period. And it doesn't matter what's left there. I'm going to rebuild even if I have to hold a shovel and a horn at the same time.'' But countless others were dissatisfied with their lives in New Orleans and were already thinking about leaving before the storm hit. ''Honestly, it was bad before,'' said Ms. Barconey, a 39-year-old nurse, citing the high poverty rate and poor public education. ''It would have to be better than what it was.'' Before the hurricane, the city was making itself better for both the middle class and the working class. Mayor C. Ray Nagin had started economic development and building programs valued at about $4 billion and had pressed for homeownership in the city's poorest areas. In fact, many residents had begun to move back to the city's core around the French Quarter, into newly gentrified areas like the Warehouse District along the Mississippi River and the Faubourg Marigny. City officials hope the rebuilding effort will bolster their economy. ''One thing New Orleans was lacking was jobs,'' said Cynthia Hedge Morrell, a member of the City Council. ''Now the rebuilding is going to bring a lot of good old-fashioned jobs. Bricklayers, plumbers, woodworkers, contractors. So is it going to be difficult? Yeah, and they might put off moving back for a while. But I do believe people want to come back to their home.'' Given how she feels now, Ms. Barconey says the makeover will have to be extreme. ''They're going to have to, some kind of way, raise that city above sea level or I'm not going back. I'm serious. I'm not putting myself in that same predicament.'' If city officials were to take the advice of urban planners, they would already be putting out strong messages that the destruction would not be repeated once new levees and drains were built. ''There need to be assurances that where people are rebuilding, no new flooding will happen,'' Dr. Loukaitou-Sideris said, adding that officials need to come together and publicize a master plan for the city. ''Cities that lose population eventually decline, but New Orleans is a city with such character, that would be hard to imagine unless people totally lose faith in their government,'' she said. After the way she was treated during the evacuation, Ms. Allen says she has lost that faith. Being evacuated from the Superdome, she sobbed through a cascade of tears on a Greyhound bus: ''Goodbye New Orleans. Bye-bye Louisiana.'' Looking back at that moment from a grassy stretch outside the Astrodome on Tuesday, she said she knew even then that goodbye meant forever. STORM AND CRISIS: THE DISPLACED"
"That the turn onto Exit 246B of Interstate 10 was under 12 feet of water was of no matter to the amphibious troop carrier, as with the marines on the vehicle, an amtrac, designed to storm beaches. Nor was it hard for Master Sgt. Eric White to navigate the streets in the residential district east of downtown. Street signs were about knee high when Sergeant White looked down from his command turret. It was a little odd, though, running over cars that caused the boat on wheels to jolt and lurch. Marines began operating here on Tuesday, part of the contingent of regular military forces added to National Guard units here. The domestic deployment is one of the largest in United States history. Besides the Marines, part of the ''ready'' brigade of the 82nd Airborne and First Cavalry Divisions of the Army. Sergeant White's amtrac, one of six on patrol along the southern edge of the city, saw water, water everywhere -- 18 feet deep in places. The only person other than police officers and other rescue workers whom they met was Elmore Hays, at Chamelle and West Renaissance Streets in a paddleboat, wielding a paddle. ''I am going to my house to get my stuff,'' Mr. Hays announced as the amtrac, some of the marines stifling smiles, ground to a halt. Officer Jerry Lofton of the police, said, ''We're going to take you now or we're coming back for you later.'' The man shook his head, waved them off and said, ''I have food for 30 days.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE MARINES"
"In the first of two shows devoted to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Oprah Winfrey said yesterday that the nation owed an apology to the people who died in the streets of New Orleans and elsewhere, and to the survivors whose misery was compounded by a relief effort whose inadequacy ''makes me so mad.'' Ms. Winfrey, of course, was far from the only celebrity who gained access to restricted sites in New Orleans, or whose ministrations to survivors at the Astrodome in Houston were captured by a phalanx of reporters and cameras. But unlike the politicians, musicians and movie stars who toured relief facilities and the news networks whose reporters were bound to let officials defend their relief efforts, Ms. Winfrey was able to turn her own cameras on the suffering, to have a celebrity physician tour medical facilities and diagnose injuries, to orchestrate family reunions and to feature aid efforts headed by celebrities like Jamie Foxx and Faith Hill. ''I was sitting at home feeling frustrated and useless, like so many other people, so I came down to personally assess how I could best be of service,'' Ms. Winfrey said yesterday in a statement relayed by a spokeswoman. What she found, she said, surprised her: ''Nothing I saw on television prepared me for what I experienced on the ground,'' she said on the show. While she stopped short of overt criticism of the relief efforts, she said later: ''This makes me so mad. This should not have happened.'' And after hearing descriptions of people dying unattended in the streets, she said, ''I think we all -- this country owes these people an apology.'' Yesterday's installment of Ms. Winfrey's one-hour syndicated television show featured her at the Astrodome, where she also took her characteristic optimism to survivors, vowing that ''I'll get the country to pray'' for them and telling one mother of seven, ''I believe you can come up out of that storm and you can have a better life.'' ''Yes, ma'am,'' the woman responded. With the recent departure of the network news anchors Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings, Ms. Winfrey's has been perhaps the most familiar television face to greet survivors and to try to explain to viewers what happened. Tuesday's show featured tape of Ms. Winfrey's visit to New Orleans on Sunday, when she was escorted inside the Superdome to see the conditions after the evacuation of the stadium earlier in the weekend. She interviewed New Orleans's mayor, C. Ray Nagin, who described ''hundreds of armed gang members running the show'' inside the stadium, and the city's police superintendent, P. Edwin Compass III, who told of rapes inside the Superdome and an attempt by gang members to take him hostage as he toured the building. Dr. Mehmet Oz, a heart surgeon and a regular contributor to Ms. Winfrey's show, toured medical facilities at New Orleans International Airport and described the removal of critically ill patients to a makeshift morgue ''just so they can pass away in peace.'' Mr. Foxx and the actor Mathew McConaughey participated in relief efforts in Texas and Louisiana, and Ms. Hill fulfilled one survivor's request at a shelter in Gulfport, Miss., that she sing ''Amazing Grace.'' Ms. Winfrey did not make a specific appeal for contributions. But her Angel Network organization donated $1 million to America's Second Harvest, a food bank, and on her Web site, www.oprah.com, she lists organizations where donations can be made. Wednesday's show is to include Ms. Winfrey in Mississippi and other celebrities involved with relief efforts, among them Chris Rock, Julia Roberts and Lisa Marie Presley. Correction: September 29, 2005, Thursday An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III."
"Two Navy helicopter pilots and their crews returned from New Orleans on Aug. 30 expecting to be greeted as lifesavers after ferrying more than 100 hurricane victims to safety. Instead, their superiors chided the pilots, Lt. David Shand and Lt. Matt Udkow, at a meeting the next morning for rescuing civilians when their assignment that day had been to deliver food and water to military installations along the Gulf Coast. ''I felt it was a great day because we resupplied the people we needed to and we rescued people, too,'' Lieutenant Udkow said. But the air operations commander at Pensacola Naval Air Station ''reminded us that the logistical mission needed to be our area of focus.'' The episode illustrates how the rescue effort in the days immediately after Hurricane Katrina had to compete with the military's other, more mundane logistical needs. Only in recent days, after the federal response to the disaster has come to be seen as inadequate, have large numbers of troops and dozens of helicopters, trucks and other equipment been poured into to the effort. Early on, the military rescue operations were smaller, often depending on the initiative of individuals like Lieutenants Shand and Udkow. The two lieutenants were each piloting a Navy H-3 helicopter -- a type often used in rescue operations as well as transport and other missions -- on that Tuesday afternoon, delivering emergency food, water and other supplies to Stennis Space Center, a federal facility near the Mississippi coast. The storm had cut off electricity and water to the center, and the two helicopters were supposed to drop their loads and return to Pensacola, their home base, said Cmdr. Michael Holdener, Pensacola's air operations chief. ''Their orders were to go and deliver water and parts and to come back,'' Commander Holdener said. But as the two helicopters were heading back home, the crews picked up a radio transmission from the Coast Guard saying helicopters were needed near the University of New Orleans to help with rescue efforts, the two pilots said. Out of range for direct radio communication with Pensacola, more than 100 miles to the east, the pilots said, they decided to respond and turned their helicopters around, diverting from their mission without getting permission from their home base. Within minutes, they were over New Orleans. ''We're not technically a search-and-rescue unit, but we're trained to do search and rescue,'' said Lieutenant Shand, a 17-year Navy veteran. Flying over Biloxi and Gulfport and other areas of Mississippi, they could see rescue personnel on the ground, Lieutenant Udkow said, but he noticed that there were few rescue units around the flooded city of New Orleans, on the ground or in the air. ''It was shocking,'' he said. Seeing people on the roofs of houses waving to him, Lieutenant Udkow headed in their direction. Hovering over power lines, his crew dropped a basket to pick up two residents at a time. He took them to Lakefront Airport, where local emergency medical teams had established a makeshift medical center. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Shand landed his helicopter on the roof of an apartment building, where more than a dozen people were marooned. Women and children were loaded first aboard the helicopter and ferried to the airport, he said. Returning to pick up the rest, the crew learned that two blind residents had not been able to climb up through the attic to the roof and were still in the building. Two crew members entered the darkened building to find the men, and led them to the roof and into the helicopter, Lieutenant Shand said. Recalling the rescues in an interview, he became so emotional that he had to stop and compose himself. At one point, he said, he executed a tricky landing at a highway overpass, where more than 35 people were marooned. Lieutenant Udkow said that he saw few other rescue helicopters in New Orleans that day. The toughest part, he said, was seeing so many people imploring him to pick them up and having to leave some. ''I would be looking at a family of two on one roof and maybe a family of six on another roof, and I would have to make a decision who to rescue,'' he said. ''It wasn't easy.'' While refueling at a Coast Guard landing pad in early evening, Lieutenant Udkow said, he called Pensacola and received permission to continue rescues that evening. According to the pilots and other military officials, they rescued 110 people. The next morning, though, the two crews were called to a meeting with Commander Holdener, who said he told them that while helping civilians was laudable, the lengthy rescue effort was an unacceptable diversion from their main mission of delivering supplies. With only two helicopters available at Pensacola to deliver supplies, the base did not have enough to allow pilots to go on prolonged search and rescue operations. ''We all want to be the guys who rescue people,'' Commander Holdener said. ''But they were told we have other missions we have to do right now and that is not the priority.'' The order to halt civilian relief efforts angered some helicopter crews. Lieutenant Udkow, who associates say was especially vocal about voicing his disagreement to superiors, was taken out of the squadron's flying rotation temporarily and assigned to oversee a temporary kennel established at Pensacola to hold pets of service members evacuated from the hurricane-damaged areas, two members of the unit said. Lieutenant Udkow denied that he had complained and said he did not view the kennel assignment as punishment. Dozens of military aircraft are now conducting search and rescue missions over the affected areas. But privately some members of the Pensacola unit say the base's two available transport helicopters should have been allowed to do more to help civilian victims in the days after the storm hit, when large numbers of military helicopters had not reached the affected areas. In protest, some members of the unit have stopped wearing a search and rescue patch on their sleeves that reads, ''So Others May Live.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE NAVY"
"As President Bush battled criticism over the response to Hurricane Katrina, his mother declared it a success for evacuees who ''were underprivileged anyway,'' saying on Monday that many of the poor people she had seen while touring a Houston relocation site were faring better than before the storm hit. ''What I'm hearing, which is sort of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas,'' Barbara Bush said in an interview on Monday with the radio program ''Marketplace.'' ''Everyone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality.'' ''And so many of the people in the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway,'' she said, ''so this is working very well for them.'' Mrs. Bush toured the Astrodome complex with her husband, former President George Bush, as part of an administration campaign throughout the Gulf Coast region to counter criticism of the response to the storm. Former President Bush and former President Bill Clinton are helping raise money for the rebuilding effort. White House officials did not respond on Tuesday to calls for comment on Mrs. Bush's remarks. STORM AND CRISIS: THE FORMER FIRST LADY"
"It would be absurd to look at the ruins along the coast of Mississippi and say that things are getting back to normal. Houses and stores are still spilling their insides; more than 15,000 people are still in Red Cross shelters in Mississippi, not to mention thousands more with friends and relatives; and military police officers are still blocking people from returning to their homes. But there are some small signs of recovery. For example, there are more people waiting in lines for gasoline. While such lines have become a familiar sight this past week in places far from the gulf, they only started appearing here in Gulfport last weekend. Since the day after the storm, gasoline has been primarily reserved for rescue workers, but that is slowly changing. ''Last Thursday we were open to emergency vehicles only,'' said Missy Scruggs, who was helping at a Shell station in Gulfport. The station opened to the public over the weekend, she said, but deliveries of gasoline have not been steady. On Monday, she and the other employees waited from 8:30 a.m. until 6 in the evening, but no gasoline trucks came. On Tuesday, however, things were looking up. ''We got a load last night and we got another load this morning, so it must be doing better,'' Ms. Scruggs said. Some of the fuel tankers were escorted by police cars and Humvees. The Coast Guard sent a ship to Gulfport with 1.6 million gallons of diesel fuel, intended for vehicles involved in recovery. Over the past few days, gasoline stations have been opening up around Gulfport and Biloxi. A Shell station in Biloxi opened on Monday, and cars were in line at 4 a.m. The owners of an Exxon station on Pass Road had a truckload of fuel delivered right before the storm, but they could not open until Tuesday, after passing a safety inspection. Pat Schaeffer, the assistant manager, was directing cars as they formed a line snaking around a neighboring parking lot. ''We have a $40 maximum,'' Ms. Schaeffer said. Some stations had even lower limits. Mississippi Power on Tuesday restored electricity to 91,000 customers, a little more than half of those who had lost power. All customers were expected to have power restored by Sunday, the authorities said. Cellphones were slowly picking up signals again, solving one of the major problems of the recovery effort: the inability to communicate. But despite all of the advances this week, the city is still far from normal. The search and rescue missions continue. The death toll in the six counties closest to the gulf was 143; 12 of the bodies have been identified. Gov. Haley Barbour said the death toll for the state was 196. But the emergency response operation is now in transition, said Joe Spraggins, the Harrison County director of emergency management. By the end of the week, the word ''rescue'' will be dropped entirely and the authorities will begin speaking of a recovery operation. STORM AND CRISIS: GASOLINE"
"Among a steady string of warnings delivered in recent years to New Orleans that they could be devastated by a great hurricane, one of the last was also one of the most chilling. ''Hurricane Katrina. A most powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength,'' was the headline on the National Weather Service bulletin on Aug. 28, the day before Hurricane Katrina struck. ''Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks, perhaps longer,'' the alert went on. It read like the kind of hastily typed dispatch one might expect from a meteorologist facing the storm of a lifetime and trying to ensure that leaders and citizens heeded warnings and moved to safety before all communications failed. Yet it was mostly written years in advance, with just a few last-minute adjustments by the staff at the New Orleans office to reflect specific local conditions, federal weather agency officials said yesterday. The goal of having the descriptions preprogrammed into computers is to save time for the local meteorologists whose job was both to encourage residents to stay safe and to track evolving conditions, said Walt Zaleski, the Weather Service warning coordination program manager in the regional headquarters. STORM AND CRISIS"
"They nailed a table against one window, ran a heavy electric wheelchair with a table on top against another and pushed a couch against a door. These failed defenses are still in St. Rita's nursing home, as are at least 14 swollen, unrecognizable bodies. St. Bernard Parish officials say that 32 of the home's roughly 60 residents died on Aug. 29, more than a week ago. It is a measure of the enormity of the disaster that has struck southern Louisiana that no one has removed many of the bodies, and local officials say there are no immediate plans to do so. The flood victims still lie where they died -- draped over a wheelchair, wrapped in a shower curtain, lying on a floor in several inches of muck. The home, about 20 miles southeast of downtown New Orleans, is still surrounded by three feet of murky water. Eight vehicles are parked in front, covered in debris and mud. Indeed, officials suspect that there may be hundreds of similar, though smaller scenes of death that will become apparent only after the water recedes and they are able to search every house in the region. Many evacuees have told stories of near escapes, of busting out attic windows or axing through the roof to reach safety. The stories that will never be told are of those who tried and failed to make those escapes. St. Rita's nursing home whispers this story. Ricky Melerine, a St. Bernard Parish councilman, said the water in his area rose at least three feet from 10 to 10:15 that Monday morning. And it rose faster still after that. Ronald Nunez, a local resident, said several men tried to save St. Rita's residents by floating some out on mattresses. Others were able to walk and float on their own to a nearby school, Mr. Nunez said. And someone had time to put up a fight against the tide. Nails were pounded through a table. Dressers were thrown against windows. Several electric wheelchairs were gathered near the front entrance, perhaps in hopes of evacuation. They simply ran out of time. There are signs in the home that the water rose to the roof. Three inches of muck still cover the floors. Tadpoles wriggle in doorways. The stench is nauseating. The story of St. Rita's leads locals here to voice the same frustrations they have about the entire disaster. ''Why didn't they evacuate?'' Mr. Nunez asked. ''Why?'' Mr. Nunez also said, with some bitterness, that his parish got only sporadic help from state and federal authorities. St. Bernard's Parish has five major nursing homes with roughly 65 patients each, said Henry Rodriguez Jr., the parish president. There are another six smaller facilities, he said. Almost all but St. Rita's were evacuated before the storm. Steve Kuiper, vice president of operations for Acadian Ambulance, said he was told that St. Rita's had an evacuation plan that depended on another nursing home. Acadian, by far the largest ambulance provider in the state, used helicopters to evacuate many of the parish's neediest medical cases after the storm hit. But Mr. Kuiper said he never heard from St. Rita's. ''They didn't think this would ever happen,'' Mr. Melerine said. ''They just didn't evacuate.'' The failure at St. Rita's is particularly difficult to explain. The home is in a depression in the ground. The nearby road, which was covered with four or five feet of water, sits at least five feet above the home's floor. The home appears in retrospect to be particularly vulnerable to flood. Efforts to reach its management late Tuesday were unsuccessful. Military and private helicopters began ferrying people out of St. Bernard Parish almost as soon as the storm hit. The Coast Guard spent much of the day of the storm landing people on a berm above the Mississippi River near downtown Chalmette, which is some of the highest ground around. Mr. Nunez said he helped establish a shelter there. Water was running so fast down the nearby road that it nearly swept some of those seeking shelter away. Mr. Nunez said he had to tie himself to a tractor to save some people from the current. ''We ran a little over 400 people through that camp,'' Mr. Nunez said. Dozens of boats are still on the side of the road in and around Chalmette, most of them washed there by the storm, and others stranded there after use by rescuers. Janie Fuller, an Acadian paramedic, helped deliver a baby in the town jail and then managed to get a helicopter to evacuate mother and child. Ms. Fuller got another woman out who seemed to be suffering internal bleeding by commandeering an air boat and then a pickup truck to get her to a landing zone for a National Guard helicopter. Still, the parish is only now getting the full attention of the authorities, who initially focused on the tens of thousands stranded in the Superdome and the convention center in New Orleans. For parish residents, this is a badge of honor as well as a source of quiet anger. As a result, there are myriad stories of heroism and rescues in St. Bernard Parish. But there is also St. Rita's. ''I just can't understand how you don't evacuate,'' Mr. Melerine said. STORM AND CRISIS: THE VICTIMS"
"The floodwaters began to drain fitfully from this crippled city on Tuesday as a handful of pumps came back into operation. But with growing concerns about gas leaks, fires, toxic water and diseases spread by mosquitoes, Mayor C. Ray Nagin said he wanted to ratchet up pressure on the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 remaining citizens to leave. Mr. Nagin said he was reissuing a mandatory evacuation order and urged stragglers to leave immediately, saying he did not want possible explosions and disease to increase a death toll that, Lt. David Benelli, president of the Police Association of New Orleans, said could reach 2,000 to 20,000. In Washington, President Bush promised an investigation into what went wrong in the response to Hurricane Katrina and planned to dispatch Vice President Dick Cheney to the Gulf Coast to cut through any bureaucratic obstacles slowing the recovery. [Page A17.] The Senate and the House also announced their own investigation into the government's response, with Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a leading Republican, calling the response ''woefully inadequate.'' ''If our system did such a poor job when there was no enemy,'' said Ms. Collins, chairwoman of the Homeland Security Committee, ''how would the federal, state and local governments have coped with a terrorist attack that provided no advance warning and that was intent on causing as much death and destruction as possible?'' The committee is preparing for public hearings next week on response to the storm. Officials said about 60 percent of New Orleans was still under water, but that was down from a peak of about 80 percent. Most of the gain came because the Army Corps of Engineers began opening gaps in the city's levees after the water level in surrounding bodies of water fell. The holes ensured that the levees -- designed to keep water out of the below-sea-level city -- would not hold it in. Four of the approximately 40 pumping stations in the New Orleans area were running on Tuesday at least at partial capacity, officials said, but haltingly; a fifth giant one, at the 17th Street Canal, site of a major levee breach, started but had to be shut off again because the pumps sucked in debris. Officials said it would take 24 days to pump the water from an eastern section of New Orleans and 80 days to clear the flooding from Chalmette, the nearby seat of St. Bernard Parish. The receding waters were expected to reveal ever more bodies, to be identified by a team of forensic pathologists, medical examiners, coroners and morticians from local funeral homes. ''We are going to take one deceased victim at a time and count one at a time,'' said Robert Johannessen, a spokesman for Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals. Of the process of identifying the bodies, Mr. Johannessen said, ''It could take days, it could take years, it could take lifetimes.'' The official death toll in Louisiana stood at 83, but state officials said the counting had only begun. In Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour announced Tuesday evening that the state's ''unofficial but credible estimate'' of the death toll was at 196, but that it was still rising. Mr. Barbour said that more than a quarter of the deaths had been reported in inland counties, not along the coast. Evacuees continued to come back into Jefferson Parish to check on their homes, overwhelming roads and bridges. Interstate 10, which connects Baton Rouge and New Orleans, was backed up for about five miles. Louisiana officials offered a first glimpse at the environmental wreckage. The state secretary of environmental quality, Michael D. McDaniel, said that wildlife habitats along hundreds of miles of coastline had been destroyed and that the hurricane exacerbated the slow coastal erosion that had already made the coast more vulnerable to hurricanes. Mr. McDaniel said that there was no alternative to pumping billions of gallons of brackish water back into Lake Pontchartrain, but that it was too early to determine the harmfulness of the toxins and pollutants that were being slowly sifted out of New Orleans. ''I know there's been a lot of discussion about 'toxic soup' and 'witch's brew,''' he said. ''I've seen no data to date that backs up that kind of statement. We do know and would expect that there are a lot of bacteriological contaminants in the water.'' In New Orleans, four major fires had broken out by Tuesday morning and gas leaks were numerous, Mayor Nagin said. ''I don't want make any statement that suggests I'm giving up on New Orleans,'' he said at a news conference. ''But it's a very volatile situation in the city right now. There's lots of oil on the water and there's gas leaks where it's bubbling up, and there's fire on top of that. If those two unite, God bless us. I don't know what's going to happen.'' Mr. Nagin said in an interview that a new evacuation order would eliminate exemptions that had allowed people to stay in hotels and hospitals. Essentially, the city will be closed to everyone but law enforcement, military, and public safety and health officials while it is drained of water and utilities are restored. The 82nd Airborne Division closed a Hyatt hotel to civilians on Tuesday afternoon. The new evacuation order has been drafted and will be issued shortly, Mr. Nagin said, even though Louisiana state officials question his authority to issue such a command. ''I don't care, I'm doing it,'' he said. ''We have to get people out.'' That meant people were once again bound to the city's convention center, where 25,000 people or more had huddled in desperate conditions for days. At St. Charles and Louisiana Avenues, about two dozen people were patted down by federal customs officials and placed on a bus for the convention center, where they were to be airlifted out of town. Told that some people were waiting as long as three hours at the convention center before being flown out, Mr. Nagin said that was a considerable improvement over the five days that it took some people to be evacuated last week. Lucas Russ, 65, a retired school district employee, said, ''It's getting nasty and really smelly,'' as he prepared to board a bus with a bag of his belongings. Mr. Russ said that National Guard troops had told him he had to leave and that he would receive no more food and water. Guard officials denied that, and Mr. Nagin said that many evacuees were delirious, severely dehydrated, missing their medication and in need of immediate medical attention. The mayor said that the National Guard had asked him whether handing out sustenance provisions would encourage people to stay, but that his response was, ''Do not harm anyone, do not allow anyone to starve, do not allow anyone to go without water and always treat everyone with respect.'' That left officials with the question of how to strongly encourage holdouts to leave. No one is being forced to leave yet, but officials said that could change. ''We may have to force people out to save their lives, if we get to that point,'' said P. Edwin Compass III, superintendent of police. ''I'm using this as a tactic to scare people into leaving.'' Brig. Gen. Michael P. Fleming, an Army National Guard commander said of a forced evacuation: ''It's a tough decision. Between the mayor and governor, if they decide that's what's to be done, the New Orleans Police Department, the state police and National Guard would be part of it. We would help them implement it if we're called on to do so.'' With assistance from 4,000 National Guard troops and another 4,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne, New Orleans was now secure and ''locked down,'' with looting reduced to minimal levels, said Warren J. Riley, the deputy superintendent of the New Orleans police. Mr. Nagin said, ''I think we're turning the corner.'' Still, parts of the city, like the Ninth Ward and New Orleans East, along with Chalmette in neighboring St. Bernard Parish, remain inundated, and it could take two months to get electricity fully restored to the hardest-hit areas, officials said. Police officers and firefighters have been inoculated against hepatitis, cholera, typhoid, tetanus and diphtheria. The spine of St. Charles Avenue, with its broken canopy of oak trees and its streetcar tracks laced with downed power lines, provided a look at the successes and failures of New Orleans's recovery effort on Tuesday. Near St. Charles and Josephine Street, a fire consumed two city blocks, officials from the Oklahoma National Guard said. At Lee Circle, Victor Mejia, 58, a janitor, stood in the shade and said he had no intention of leaving. ''I live here,'' he said. ''Where am I going to go?'' With attention turning to what had gone wrong, Mr. Nagin said he wanted an independent assessment of the missteps, saying he believed the matter was beyond the ability of politicians to solve. He blamed a lack of coordination, a rescue plan that was slow to be carried out and what he called a ''two-step'' danced by federal and state officials to determine who was in charge. The mayor said he welcomed any effort to criticize his own handling of the crisis. ''My big question to anybody who's trying to shift the blame is, 'Where were you?''' Mr. Nagin said. ''I was here. I know what happened. I walked among the people in the Superdome and in the convention center. I saw babies dying. I saw old people so tired, they said, 'Just let me lay down and die.' They can talk that, but bring it on. I'm ready for it.'' No Photographing the Dead NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 6 (Reuters) -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency said on Tuesday that it did not want news photographers to take pictures of the dead as they were recovered in New Orleans. FEMA rejected requests from journalists to accompany rescue boats. An agency spokeswoman said that ''the recovery of the victims is being treated with dignity and the utmost respect.''

"A four-degree rise in water temperature near South America last month provides strong evidence that El Niño, the disruptive influence on global weather, is developing, government weather experts report, but how severe the cycle will become remains uncertain. The update on the periodic shift in ocean conditions was described on Thursday by meteorologists at the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The temperature data, corroborated by a rise in regional precipitation and the displacement of cold-water fish by tropical species in the equatorial Pacific, is consistent with similar changes observed in the early stages of previous Niño episodes, the agency said. For several months, the agency has been predicting that a Niño event was likely this spring. El Niño -- a Spanish reference to the Christ child, since it usually appears in the eastern tropical Pacific around Christmas -- is a marked warming of ocean waters along the Equator near the international date line. When water temperatures rise significantly enough to alter cloud cover, increased rainfall occurs, particularly in the tropical Pacific basin. The weather pattern typically arises every four to five years and can last up to 18 months. In 1997-1998, El Niño conditions were blamed for severe floods in Peru and Ecuador and scorching droughts in Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The weather event caused thousands of deaths, displaced millions of people and resulted in billions of dollars in damage worldwide. In the United States, agricultural losses during El Niño of 1997-1998 reached an estimated $2 billion, and property losses topped $2.6 billion, according to data compiled by the atmospheric agency. El Niño is notoriously difficult to predict, but meteorologists have been able to improve their forecasts in recent years, using buoys, satellites and other devices to give real-time atmospheric and oceanic data, along with refined computer models. For the United States, El Niño events typically mean more rain and snow in the southern tier in the winter; the developing pattern will spur Western water managers to capture the extra rain. The Great Plains and Pacific Northwest usually experience warmer weather later in the year, and fewer tropical storm systems develop during the Atlantic hurricane season. Enhanced prediction techniques enable farmers to determine the best sites to plant crops and the most effective techniques for applying fertilizers in the face of abnormal weather conditions. Extended forecasting also enables state emergency management agencies to prepare better for potential damage. ''It's still too early to determine the potential strength of this El Niño or exactly what weather conditions it will bring to the United States,'' said Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., a retired Navy vice admiral and under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere. ''But it is likely these warming conditions in the tropical Pacific will continue until early 2003,'' Dr. Lautenbacher said. In Peru, officials have already reported significant effects on their fishing industry, the oceanic and atmospheric agency said, as cold-water anchovies are disappearing near their coast with warm water moving into the region. During 1997-1998, Peru's anchovy industry suffered but eventually rebounded. Some weather experts still doubt that the current warming trend will result outright in an El Niño. The International Research Institute for Climate Prediction, financed in part by the oceanic agency, predicted that while there was an ''enhanced likelihood'' of a localized Niño in the Pacific this spring, ''uncertainty still exists'' as to whether El Niño would develop full-fledged in the next few months. The institute estimates there is a 50 percent chance of El Niño conditions developing by mid-2002."
"IT had been a long, hot January day, but at last I was in sight of the remote tropical Fijian islet I'd been longing for. Beyond the long hilly island of Moturiki, two stretches of coral sand, each a quarter of a mile long, barely rose from above the waves, festooned with coconut palms and mangroves. The closer one was our destination; Jim, our taciturn pilot, guided the small open boat into the shallows and helped us off. A haphazard collection of mostly backpackers who had boarded the boat on Ovalua, we waded into limpid waters and onto the shore, where tall palms rose to meet us. There were seven of us at the tiny budget resort: a family of four from Canada, Annick from Belgium, a young Englishman, and me. Presently, the staff members, who were from a village on neighboring Moturiki and who all seemed related, served us lunch under a thatched picnic shelter. Then we languidly separated, each to a beachside palm-leaf hut -- the traditional Fijian bure (pronounced BYOO-ray) -- except for Annick, who was staying alone in the large wooden dormitory. I spent the afternoon lolling in turquoise water, gazing at flying fishes, and reflecting on my good luck. It was hurricane season, and with several tropical storms in the area, it had been quite possible that the boat would not have been able to cross. But the nearest cyclones were reportedly moving off, another was in Australia, the crossing had been easy and here I was. Hermit crabs in tiny jewel-like shells caught my eye on the beach. Toward dusk, big land crabs skittered across the sands, while flying foxes prepared for their nightly forays in search of fruit. After a communal supper, a woman who identified herself as Big Sally appeared with a hurricane lamp (the island generator having broken down several years before). I thanked her; the tropical night falls early. ''Don't turn it off!'' she said sternly. ''Weather very bad.'' Oh? I suppose the term hurricane lamp should have given me a clue, but after duly writing my journal entry, I blew out the lamp and crept under the mosquito netting. The 8-by 10-foot hut had windows on three sides and an open ceiling, but the air felt close. Outside, the wind began to rise. I could not sleep. It became increasingly clear that Sally was right and the weather report was wrong. I had not thought a desert island could be so noisy. The wind blew a constant, high-pitched scream through the trees; waves pounded ever more insistently on the beach; rain lashed at the bure and into the windows, and coconuts dropped like shells. The effect was that of an express train whizzing constantly through your living room. About 11:30, I spotted the lonely figure of Jim, the boatman, walking up the beach with a flashlight, his slicker billowing behind him. He slowly disappeared into the gloom. It got no better. I reflected on the odds of a leaf hut staying intact in hurricane winds. I thought of the height of Pacific Ocean waves, and of the island's maximum altitude of six feet above sea level, and listened to the surf creeping up the narrow beach. Finally, I took flashlight in hand and a few clothes. Braving the gale and the falling coconuts, I struggled a couple of hundred yards and pushed open the door to the dorm. Annick, its lone occupant, turned to me sleepily -- how she managed to sleep I didn't know -- and asked, ''Do you think it's the cyclone?'' It was stuffy inside, and there were enormous cockroaches, but the solid structure and the company made me feel more secure. Sleep was still elusive: every so often I compulsively got up and pushed open a shutter to see how close the waves were. Rain began to leak steadily through the roof onto my bed. I was too exhausted to switch beds, and simply curled up. Why, oh why, hadn't I been content just to go somewhere like Cape Cod? Why had I been seduced by the romantic idea of a South Pacific island? But this was foolishness; I'd experienced hurricanes on the Cape. Still, it had seemed different with a sturdy roof over one's head and all America's rescue systems in the background. Here, it was just us, the huts and the sea. Evacuation was impossible. About 3 or so, the door pushed open, waking us from a half-slumber, and Jim came in cautiously. He'd been making the rounds again, and noticed I wasn't in my hut. Relieved, he smiled and assured us we'd be all right. ''But bure safer than here,'' he remarked. I didn't really believe him. The storm did not abate. After 8, I was startled awake by Jim tapping me on the knee. ''Breakfast!'' he announced cheerily. The day looked no more promising than the night had been, but survival, I supposed, counted for something. The roof of the picnic shelter had blown down and lay sprawled over the table, so we straggled to the staff quarters, dodging airborne coconuts. All the staff, it turned out, had crossed to the village the night before, leaving Jim to mind us on his own. And after being up all night, he had made breakfast. All day the storm raged. Mostly we stayed inside. I noticed that the windows of my hut had been battened down. The others had stayed in their bures overnight, the Canadian children huddled under their bed. Eventually, the rain let up, and cabin-fevered, we stood in the lee of the dorm and watched the bowed trees and the sea-foam creeping up between the huts. A dazed bird landed on the grass. Occasionally, one of the remaining coconuts fell with a sharp report. By evening, the bulk of the storm had passed. Jim had been right: the bures were all still standing, not much the worse for wear. The ground was littered with palm fronds and other debris, but we were lucky: the reef, a mile off, had protected us from the ocean's full wrath. On Kadavu, another Fijian island, a village had been washed away and villagers had had to flee to safety. The next day, tropical paradise returned. Palm fronds swayed in the breeze against a blue sky, and the distant roar, which my brain wanted to interpret as traffic, was the remains of the cyclone, crashing on the reef. Essay DENISE FAINBERG is a teacher who lives in Bend, Ore. Correction: March 10, 2002, Sunday Because of an editing error, an essay last Sunday about being on an island in Fiji during a hurricane misspelled the island's name. It is Ovalau, not Ovalua."
"Caught between the Mississippi and the long shoreline of Lake Pontchartrain, this low-lying city has long depended on levees and luck. Now engineers say those are not enough to protect New Orleans, much of it below sea level, from a devastating flood that could threaten it if a storm surge from a powerful hurricane out of the Gulf of Mexico propelled a wall of water into the lake and the city. That event could place vast sections under 20 feet or more of water, engineers and scientists say, with worst-case computer predictions showing death tolls in the tens of thousands with many more people trapped by high water that has no natural drainage outlets. ''There's no way to minimize the amount of devastation that could take place under such circumstances,'' warned Walter S. Maestri, director of emergency management of Jefferson Parish, a suburban region with 455,000 residents on the city's western and southern sides. Perhaps the surest protection is building up the coastal marshes that lie between New Orleans and the sea and that have been eroding at high rates. But restoration will require time, a huge effort and prohibitive sums of money, perhaps $14 billion, according to a study by a panel from federal and state agencies, universities and business. Engineers are considering other ways to protect the heart of the city and provide an island of refuge in the French Quarter and government centers. Though such approaches are less expensive, they come with their own problems. One plan involves walling off an area to keep out water. But where would the wall be built and who would benefit from it? Many residents give little thought to such matters, counting on the knowledge that New Orleans has escaped hurricane disaster in the past. The most nervous people are those paid to worry about such things, like Dr. Joseph N. Suhayda, director of the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at Louisiana State University. Like other coastal researchers, he has been using the latest geological and meteorological data to refine computer models of how different storms would damage the city. On a bright spring day with fair skies and no trace of the sultry air that will dominate the weather in the months ahead, Dr. Suhayda and a few colleagues drove city streets 1,000 yards from levees that hold back Lake Pontchartrain. At New York Avenue, near the lakefront campus of the University of New Orleans, the car stopped, and the engineer walked over and unfolded a wood measuring stick to its 25-foot length. He planted one end on the pavement and raised it until it was vertical. The other end poked into the sky well above a corner light pole, but it was still well beneath the level of a concrete wall that rose on top of a grassy slope 100 feet away. ''Behind that,'' Dr. Suhayda said, indicating the wall, ''is a canal that runs into Lake Pontchartrain. Its surface is roughly about the same as the lake's surface.'' In a hypothetical situation projected by his computers, Dr. Suhayda continued, a slow-moving Category 4 hurricane, with winds up to 155 miles an hour, or a Category 5 hurricane with even stronger winds could leave water 30 feet deep on this neighborhood street, which is more than five feet below sea level. Though Category 5 hurricanes are very rare, Camille in 1969 devastated Pass Christian, Miss., just 50 miles east of New Orleans, and killed scores of residents with winds that exceeded 200 miles an hour and a 35-foot storm surge. In most areas vulnerable to hurricanes, the water would drain away quickly. That is not the case here. So city planners and engineers continue to work on ways to improve an evacuation plan for the 1.3 million residents in the metropolitan region and to soften a storm's blow. Most long-term projects intended to blunt a hurricane involve slowing the loss of marshlands. One method calls for additional control gates to let the Mississippi pour sediment-rich water into surrounding lands, a process that would eventually raise or at least maintain their elevation. Other proposals are to rebuild eroded offshore barrier islands, erect a wall of levees across much of the lower delta, plug the dredged containership channel that gives the Gulf of Mexico waters easy access to the vulnerable eastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain and help defend that shore with higher flood gates. Perhaps the most unconventional is the ''community haven'' concept advanced by Dr. Suhayda and others in the belief that radical remedies may be necessary to soften a knockout punch by nature. More theory than an organized campaign, it envisions a two-story-high wall with flood gates at crucial intersections to seal off the southern part of the city from a bend in the river at the French Quarter to another one eight miles west. If the rest of the city flooded, Dr. Suhayda said, the ''island'' between the wall and the river's levees could become a refuge for thousands of residents fleeing their homes, as well as preserving the cultural and government center. But obtaining the money on the scale needed is far tougher than devising plans, especially if some skeptics dismiss the worst-case predictions as scare tactics to help finance university research or for further environmental intrusions on the coast. Researchers, though, say they are not making up the city's potential peril, which arises from geology and history. As tight as a pimento in an olive, most of New Orleans is stuffed between the Mississippi and the lake, and it is settling as fast as the rest of the delta or faster, said Dr. Roy Dokka, a geologist at Louisiana State. Although much agonizing has gone into problems of the river, and its metaphoric temperaments have become part of songs and folklore, it is the 300-square-mile lake that troubles him, Dr. Dokka said. As New Orleans grew as a seaport, petrochemical hub, tourist destination and cultural phenomenon, neighboring marshes were drained and the levee system expanded to keep the water out of new suburbs and industrial parks, hastening the drying that led to sinking, and making a bad situation even worse. A computerized cross-section of the city's topography recently created by L.S.U. scientists and engineers shows a shallow bowl-like profile. On the southern edge along the river, the rim rises about five feet above sea level for most of the French Quarter, a half-mile-wide sloping plain created by the river's natural earthen banks. A flood wall built by the Army Corps of Engineers to hold back a cresting river -- which on normal days moves more than 300,000 cubic feet of water a second past the city at an average depth of 90 feet -- raised the levee to a uniform height of 25 feet above sea level, or 10 feet above the average annual high water surface level of the river, when water can rush by at the rate of one million cubic feet of water, or more, a second. Most of the city north of the French Quarter was reclaimed from a boggy morass. The lowest sections -- residential areas and shops that sit on drained marshland at 5 to 10 feet below sea level -- form a wide band near the lake's southern shore. New Orleans International Airport to the west and industrial complexes and residential areas to the east are at sea level or below it. Spider webs of city canals and wide ditches that measure 185 miles in length feed 22 pumping stations that lift water to a height where it can flow into the lake, over levees built more than a half-century ago that stand 15 to 17 feet above sea level. Water cascading over the levee wall or flooding from swollen marshes at the lake's eastern and western ends is just one part of the nightmare, the experts say. Draining the city after the storm moves away may take weeks, they point out. The city would be trapped inside the levees, steeped in a worsening ''witches' brew'' of pollutants like sewage, landfill waste, chemicals and the bodies of drowned humans and animals. Bourbon Street could remain under 10 feet of water, with water swirling above two-story houses in neighborhoods closer to the lake. Dr. Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the L.S.U. Hurricane Center, said that in a worst-case situation with incomplete evacuation ''we could have up to 45,000 killed and 400,000 trapped on roofs, with 700,000 evacuees who would now be homeless.'' Dr. van Heerden said it would take at least nine weeks to pump the city dry. Pumping stations, which sometimes fail in heavy seasonal downpours in a city that receives nearly five feet of rain a year, would be inoperative under those conditions for days if not weeks, Dr. van Heerden said. The chemical stew that would be pumped into the lake and surrounding marshes would be an environmental disaster by itself, he added. He said that the cost in human misery might be incalculable but that the bills for insured damages, public works repairs and replacements and the economic effects might total $50 billion. Despite the specter of such losses, it has been difficult to find enough money to build up the protective marshlands, said Jack C. Caldwell, head of the state's Natural Resources Department. Washington has been disinclined to earmark billions to protect the marshland and has resisted appeals from Baton Rouge to share revenues from offshore oil production with the state for that purpose, Mr. Caldwell said. In the meantime, residents take their chances every hurricane season, which starts on June 1. According to his computer models, Dr. Suhayda said, the odds that the city will be hit by a cataclysmic storm in any given year are less than 1 in 100. The American Red Cross is taking the threat seriously. It has declared it no longer will provide hurricane shelters in the New Orleans area, saying that placing staff there in a killer storm will represent too much risk for its employees, volunteers and the general public. Correction: May 6, 2002, Monday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about flood control in New Orleans referred imprecisely to the reliability of the city's pumping stations. While they sometimes fail to keep up with the rain in very heavy downpours, the pumps themselves rarely stop working."
"One of the strongest Pacific storms to strike Mexico in decades roared ashore this afternoon, threatening thousands of people and hundreds of villages. Federal and state officials said they had evacuated close to 100,000 people in coastal cities and towns from south of Mazatlán to Puerto Vallarta, two prominent tourist sites. In and around San Blas, a fishing and tourist town near the center of the storm's landfall, hundreds of homes were reported damaged or destroyed and thousands of people braced for the threat of flooding and landslides. Only one death was reported in the first hours after the hurricane struck. But officials said the storm's full impact on rural regions would not be clear until the weekend. They forecast up to 10 inches of rain inland tonight in Durango and Zacatecas States, and they warned of flash floods, mudslides and dam breaks. The United States National Hurricane Center called the hurricane, code-named Kenna, the third-strongest recorded storm ever to strike Mexico from the Pacific. The hurricane missed by 180 miles a gathering of world leaders here in Cabo San Lucas, on the tip of the Baja peninsula, where President Bush is to arrive Saturday morning. The storm's sustained winds dropped from a potentially catastrophic 160 miles an hour to about 140 m.p.h. as it struck land, at about 1 p.m. The winds died down to 80 miles an hour as it moved on a northeastern course across the country toward the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane center said the storm could emerge near the Texas coast. The storm downed trees and power lines, knocked out electricity and telephone service and blocked the main coastal highway near Tepic, the capital of Nayarit State, where 3,000-foot-high mountains enfolding Huichol Indian hamlets meld into swampy marshlands. Among the thousands of evacuees, many were afraid that they would lose their life's possessions. ''When I found out that the hurricane would hit us I became really scared, because I live in a plywood house and I have six children,'' said Antonio Romero, 29, a construction worker who huddled in a government shelter in Puerto Vallarta with his wife and family. The authorities said that at least 5,000 people were displaced by the storm in and around Puerto Vallarta, including outlying areas threatened by mudslides. Some 100 tourists in the city, mostly Americans, were evacuated from hotels to a makeshift shelter at a restaurant. Some complained at the lack of comfortable facilities and the presence of no-smoking signs. Carmen Segura Rangel, the head of Mexico's civil protection system, said at least 90,000 people had been evacuated in Nayarit alone. Among them were some 3,000 federal prisoners, family members and guards from the Maria Islands off the coast. The prisoners were moved to shelters on the islands. In Puerto Vallarta, 20-foot waves surged over the breakwater, winds cut power to much of the city, cars bobbed in wind-tossed waves and sculptures that lined the seafront promenade were washed away. Some families refused to leave their homes, despite the urging of the local military and civil authorities, who reported 40 minor injuries as well as the death of a man who drowned in the raging Río Cuale. Interior Minister Santiago Creel said 5,000 rescue workers were mobilized and a state of emergency declared in Nayarit, some sections of the coast of Jalisco, including Puerto Vallarta, and the coast of Sinaloa, including Mazatlán. The declaration gives local authorities access to a $650 million federal disaster fund."
"Highways across southern Louisiana and Texas were solid columns of steel today as more than half a million people grabbed their valuables and fled their homes, looking for higher, safer ground before Hurricane Lili hit. The exodus of cars and trucks, some with furniture lashed down on their roofs, began in low-lying areas but quickly spread inland as the storm intensified and threatened to become the worst natural disaster here in decades. ''This one is for real,'' said Debbie Conrad, spokeswoman for the Louisiana office of emergency preparedness. ''The storm is very tight and very fast. This could be horrible.'' Lili is expected to slam into the Louisiana coast Thursday afternoon as a violent hurricane, Category 4 on the five-point scale. By 11 tonight, it was 195 miles south of New Orleans, packing tree-snapping sustained winds of up to 145 miles per hour. ''We haven't seen anything like this in 40 years,'' said Will Langlinais, president of Iberia Parish, a coastal community 140 miles west of New Orleans. ''Call your friends. Call your family. We're telling everyone to get out.'' Lili dwarfs Tropical Storm Isidore, which brought lots of rain to the area last week but no serious wind damage. Even as Isidore came and went, weather experts were watching Lili grow stronger each day. The storm began brewing in the southern Caribbean as a tropical depression, pummeled Cuba and then broke for the warm open waters of the gulf where it gained tremendous speed. Many forecasters were comparing Lili to Andrew, a hurricane that flattened Homestead, Fla., in 1992. The biggest fear concerns the storm surge, the effect of wind-whipped waters rising high above their normal levels. The authorities in southern Louisiana fear Lili could push water up 20 feet, which would bury thousands of homes, wash out roads and turn the area into a debris-strewn marsh or a graveyard. ''From day one, we told people there would be a storm surge,'' Sheriff Sid Herbert of Iberia Parish said. ''We're trying to avoid a large number of deaths.'' All residents of Iberia Parish were ordered to get out of their homes. Those who stayed behind were told to leave the authorities with their name, address and next of kin. The area, part of the woodsy, marshy Cajun heartland, is only 10 feet above sea level. Up the road in Lafayette, where street signs are in French and visitors are welcomed at the airport with a big poster that reads ''Bon Jour!'' downtown was a ghost town, deserted except for workers making final preparations for the storm. The only sounds were the buzz of saws, the squeak of duct tape and the thump of sand bags being dropped in front of doors. ''Lili looks pretty mean,'' Brian Frederick said as he taped X's across the windows of his hair salon. ''Could be ugly.'' As he worked, traffic streamed by. Most cars were full. Some carried furniture, with lamps and chair legs sticking out windows or trunks. Others towed boats and motorcycles. ''Hey, at least we got technology,'' Mr. Frederick said. ''In my grandparents' day, they'd have to look up in the sky, sense something was wrong in their bones and bring in the chickens based on instinct. At least we know this one's coming.'' In Terrebonne Parish, to the east, the Wal-Mart looked as if a hurricane had already hit it. Shoppers had ripped open cases of bottled water, scattering them across the floor. Overturned carts blocked the aisles. There was not a battery to be found. The authorities there were grim, especially about the possibility of flash floods. ''The water could come up, and it could come up fast,'' said Mike Deroche, the emergency preparedness director in Terrebonne. ''We're asking these people to heed the warning and leave.'' Southern Louisiana is still recovering from Isidore, which dropped as much as two feet of rain in some places. Isidore was forecast as a hurricane but then weakened as it wobbled up the gulf. Still, there was heavy flood damage, especially in areas below sea level like New Orleans. Shea Penland, a University of New Orleans geologist who has studied the effects of every hurricane since Frederick in 1979, said the damage to coastal wetlands from Isidore was extensive for a tropical storm, but Lili could be much worse. ''It's going to hit a part of the coast which is pretty marshy,'' he said. ''I would expect to see a lot of floating marsh, a lot of torn up marsh, a lot of sediment. And the people of New Orleans may be surprised.'' Having two big storms within a week is partly a blessing, many people said. The plywood over the windows is already up, the spare gas cans topped off, the canned goods stacked in the kitchen. But the water is still here, too. Many bayous and lakes are brimming with Isidore's rains, which is not a good sign. ''I didn't get any water in my house last week,'' said Jonathan Martin, of Theriot, a small town south of New Orleans. ''But, as high as the water is in the swamp now, if we get any more water, I think I will. The problem is the water hasn't gone anywhere yet.'' As of this afternoon, more than 200,000 people had been evacuated in Louisiana and 300,000 in Texas. Tonight officials in coastal areas of Mississippi and Alabama also called for evacuations. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas signed a disaster declaration this afternoon, and prison officials relocated 3,000 inmates to inland lockups. Mission Control in Houston canceled a space shuttle launch. Offshore oil rigs shut down. As the day progressed and the forecasts grew more bleak, Texas officials began to sound a lot like their counterparts in Louisiana. ''We've never seen anything of this magnitude,'' said Mike Melancon, a spokesman for the Jefferson county office of emergency management, near Port Arthur. ''And if it hits directly on us, it will tear everything up. We're also concerned about storm surge too. We're right on the coast. We're talking about 15 feet of water.''"
"Hurricane Lili slammed into Louisiana today with tornado-force winds that ripped trees from the ground, smashed mobile homes and caused widespread blackouts that may last for weeks. But it could have been worse. The storm lost significant strength overnight, dwindling from a Category 4 hurricane to Category 2, and no deaths or serious injuries were reported. Abbeville, a sugar cane farming community 140 miles west of New Orleans, was the hardest hit. Residents emerged from leaf-splattered homes and battered farms this afternoon to find a collage of destruction. For the Gooch family, the plan had always been to get to the big green house on St. Victor street when the weather got ugly. Twenty-one relatives from across southern Louisiana, all shapes and sizes and sensibilities, gathered on the front porch, on the highest piece of ground between them. Some sipped chocolate milk, others pulled on Bud long necks, forming a curious family portrait as they squinted into the wind and watched the world whiz by. ''Look y'all!'' yelled Beau Perry, 19. ''Across the street! The wind's sucking them shingles! Maybe we going to see a cow fly.'' ''Hush, Beau,'' said an uncle, Robert Gooch. ''Don't you talk crazy like that.'' It was not long after the hurricane cleared that officials in Louisiana and Texas were quick to pass it off as ''a blessing.'' But that did not mean much to people here, who were left tonight in muggy darkness, unable to leave their homes because of a dusk-to-dawn curfew. ''They got slammed,'' said Hucky Purpera, a spokesman for the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness. The wind split 60-foot power poles and scattered them like chopsticks. Several gas stations collapsed. Roof shingles and sharp, wet sheets of tin flew through the air like missiles. ''I watched the eye pass right over us,'' said Mayor Mark Piazza, as he strode into city hall in a baseball cap and squeaky swamp boots. ''It shook the heck out of me.'' The worst may not be over. So many utility poles are down that officials think it could be two to three weeks before electricity is restored. The city's sewage system is powered by the same grid. ''I don't know how we're going to handle this,'' Mr. Piazza said. Abbeville is a study of what can happen when a not-so-bad-storm crashes into a little town. There were other communities along the coast hit hard, too, like Kaplan, New Iberia and Franklin, where a failing levee threatened about 200 homes. More than 100,000 homes lost power, most along the same stretch of central Louisiana coastline. About 60 percent of the area's residents had evacuated. In New Orleans, there was little damage. The city is prone to flooding but Lili's storm surge was less powerful than expected. Initial reports indicated that the cherished Tabasco sauce plant in low-lying Avery Island was unscathed. In Texas the cities most exposed, like Port Arthur and Galveston, were evacuated but had few problems. Nobody predicted this Wednesday night. As Mr. Piazza huddled with his staff in his office, across from the graceful town square, the first members of the extended Gooch family began to arrive two blocks away. The family's 85-year-old Victorian house is the pride of the clan. Guests brought enormous supplies of food: pots of red beans and rice, smothered pork chops, honey buns, Chips Ahoy, Pepsi, orange juice, loaf after loaf of white bread. They came from many places: DeRidder, Erath, Henry and other hamlets near the coast. Many carried radios and flashlights. ''We figured this was high ground and safe,'' said Sallie Robertson, a family member who drove more than 100 miles to get here. As the night progressed, the weather got worse. The first trees began to fall. The gulf waters became foamy. The skies spit. ''We were sweating it,'' said Mr. Gooch, a 39-year-old body shop laborer. ''We were thinking a Cat 4 was coming our way. No matter how strong this old house is, it would have hurt us.'' At state emergency headquarters, officials called up search-and-rescue teams and even had mortuary teams waiting with trucks of ice. ''For a while, this was looking catastrophic,'' Mr. Purpera said. But then, around 4 a.m., things suddenly changed. All of a sudden, Lili began to weaken, with its eye breaking apart after the storm collided with dry air from Texas. About 9 a.m., the eye of the storm passed over Abbeville. The town was completely shuttered. Most of the pretty old Victorian homes were dark and empty and covered in plywood. There were no cars on the street. And no people in sight. Except for the Gooches. ''We couldn't resist,'' said Terry Lambert, a brother-in-law of Mr. Gooch's. ''We wanted to see the eye. Everybody wants to see the eye.'' As the wind increased to near 100 m.p.h. and the town began to fly apart in front of them, the 21 members of the extended family dragged out folding chairs and sat on the porch in the rain and watched. It took about two hours for the storm to pass. Several trailer homes were destroyed, the asphalt roof of Abbeville High School was ripped off and several businesses leveled. Officials estimated their losses in millions, not including lost sugar cane. By midafternoon, it was calm again and the Gooch family began to pack up their pots and say their goodbyes. The air smelled like fresh pine from all the felled trees lying in the streets. ''Daddy, when are the lights going to come back on?'' asked Caitlyn Gooch, 7, as she was shooed inside to help clean up."
"Mexico began to calculate the costs of a powerful Pacific hurricane today, counting its losses at three dead, thousands of homeless and tens of millions of dollars in damage. The death toll from the storm, called Kenna, could have been far higher. But the government appeared to have efficiently evacuated tens of thousands of people from the coasts and lowlands of the states of Nayarit, Sinaloa and Jalisco as the storm approached. Still, the damage was devastating in the fishing and tourist village of San Blas, and almost as bad in the popular resort of Puerto Vallarta. In San Blas, many of the 9,000 residents began returning from the state capital, Tepic, where they had taken shelter from the storm, to find their homes destroyed. About 5 percent of the town's homes are intact, said the municipal president, Eduardo Bernal Regalado. ''I know people want to come back,'' he said. ''I understand their desperation. But there is no place for them to stay.'' He said more than half of the 40 villages near San Blas were badly damaged or ruined. Brailio Medina, 30, a farmer from the village of La Libertad, four miles away, said he had returned home to find his papaya and banana crops destroyed. ''There's nothing left,'' he said. ''We have no work left. I am pretty sure that we will leave for the other side.'' He meant the United States. The scene at the town dock was chaotic, and seven large shrimping boats were tossed far ashore. In Puerto Vallarta, where the storm struck on the eve of the high season for tourists, scores of storefronts were shattered and three luxury hotels battered. Officials said the city had sustained at least $25 million worth of property damage, but vowed to repair it quickly. It may be another day or two before the full impact of the storm is accurately assessed by Mexican officials, who said today that they thought the damage would reach $50 million. That, too, was a shadow of their worst fears. The hurricane, which passed 180 miles from a meeting of world leaders here in Cabo San Lucas on the Baja peninsula, was the third most powerful storm ever recorded to strike Mexico from the Pacific, and in the past storms of that size have caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and scores of deaths. A lesser storm, named Pauline, struck near Acapulco in October 1997, killing at least 131 people. Last month, another hurricane, Isidore, struck the Yucatán peninsula and did an estimated $740 million in damage. By tonight, Kenna was a dwindling tropical depression, heading northeast and drenching the countryside."
"The troubles start on the mayor's desk, where there is a little dish of Chiclets, a ton of sticky notes and an empty plastic jug. ''Got ourselves a little water problem,'' the mayor, Mark Piazza, said. ''Want a Sprite?'' A door banged open. The police chief, Drew David, rushed in. ''Mayor, we've got looting,'' Chief David said. A go-kart was wheeled out of the Snapper dealership. Some children were picking through a storm-damaged house. ''I think we could make some arrests,'' Chief David said. ''But we've got nowhere to put them. Jail's closed.'' Ditto for the gasoline stations, the grocery stores, the minimarts, the banks and most inconvenient for adults, the schools. All are without power, and the high school has no roof, thanks to Hurricane Lili, which chewed it off on Thursday and spat it out a block away. ''Girls, we're looking at a mighty long vacation,'' said Keyanna Landry, a senior. ''Heck yeah,'' said her friend Bernadette Nunez, a sophomore, smacking her a high five. ''Thank you, Mrs. Lili.'' For a storm cheered in many places as less disastrous than expected, Hurricane Lili left this town a mess. Abbeville, a little sugar cane community in the heart of Louisiana's Cajun country, had the misfortune of being hit dead on. Winds of 115 miles an hour streamed across the roof of the white courthouse, where today the emergency operations director, Robert LeBlanc, 80, known as the General, marched around in a jumpsuit, almost proud of the beating his town took. ''One-fifteen,'' Mr. LeBlanc said. ''Saw it myself on the meter.'' Those gusts felled 200 utility poles, wiping out the electricity grid. That shut down the sewage plants, the four public schools, the city government, the 16-bed jail and some of the pumps that control water pressure. Today, water was at a drip. Then there are the little things, people said, the hurricane residue that makes life hectic. Like having to wait two hours at the Texaco station for a tank of gasoline. Or relying on a soldier in a Humvee for ice. ''We've got ourselves an ordeal,'' said Francis Touchet, a City Council member. ''Without the National Guard and some of these other agencies, we'd be in real trouble.'' Louisiana officials said Abbeville, which lies in the middle of wide, green sugar cane fields 140 miles west of New Orleans and 15 miles inland from where Hurricane Lili came ashore, was the worst hit community in the state. All day, residents of Abbeville, population 11,000, called City Hall, asking when their lights and air conditioners would come back on. A skeleton staff answered the phones, following a hypnotically consistent script. ''City of Abbeville, may I help you? Yes, I know. We're hoping it will be five days to a week.'' (Power company officials said it would be at least 10 days and maybe three weeks before electricity was restored to everyone.) ''A little optimism never hurt nobody, right?'' said Shirley Bertrand, one of the city workers. Downed trees are everywhere. Sheets of metal roofing are strewn in power lines and wrapped around utility poles like tinfoil. Glass is scattered across the historic downtown, where many buildings are more than 120 years old. Some of the old farmhouses have tree limbs in them. ''When the police chief called me, he said: 'Sheila, I got some bad news. There's a big old oak tree in your house,' '' said Sheila Harrington, who had left Abbeville before the hurricane, only to learn that her house had been gravely wounded in her absence. ''I said, 'In the house, not on the house?' He said, 'Afraid so.' '' On Friday, Ms. Harrington sat on her stoop with her year-old baby in her lap, as pickup truck after pickup truck rolled past with people shaking their heads and pointing at the hole punched into the roof of her house by an oak no less than eight feet thick. The storm had uprooted the tree. From Abbeville, damage radiates outward in all directions. More than 400,000 houses lost power, leaving a huge swath of southern Louisiana without working traffic lights. That caused serious congestion on rural highways and several wrecks. In Lafayette, the power failure meant some uncomfortable times. At the Hilton Hotel and Towers, guests were left to stagger up 15 flights of stairs to sleep in rooms with no air conditioning or fans. Temperatures have been in the 80's all week. State officials estimated Lili caused more than $200 million in damage, with Abbeville and surrounding Vermilion Parish taking $23 million in losses. President Bush declared southern Louisiana a disaster area, opening the door for federal aid. Despite all the stresses, Abbeville has maintained its good graces. People are pitching in, sharing rakes, chain saws and even dump trucks. Loveless Green, a refrigerator mechanic, spent the day picking up tree branches with his son, Loveless Jr. ''This is the day after,'' Mr. Green said. ''It ain't never fun.'' His sweating son nodded dutifully. There was still a bit of confusion. On one side of the leaf-spattered town square, the mayor was talking about another evacuation because of the sewage and water problems. Across the street, in the emergency operations center, Mr. LeBlanc, the General, was telling residents to return. ''This was no Hurricane Audrey,'' Mr. LeBlanc said, his eyes glowing with the memory of the 1957 storm. ''We'll be fine.'' The authorities decided to maintain dusk-to-dawn curfew until electricity was restored. School officials floated a plan to have high school students use the middle school in the morning, with middle school students coming in the afternoon. But with no electricity in the schools and the high school in need of major repairs, they predicted that classes were at least two weeks away. What are Ms. Landry, the senior, and her friends going to do with their time off? ''We're going to a party today,'' she said, speaking for the group. ''In the daylight.''"
"At dusk on April 28, this town 30 miles south of Washington became No. 94 on the list of unlucky places struck since 1880 by F-5 tornados, the rare class of supertwisters that produces almost unimaginable destruction. Four people died, more than 100 were injured, and a raw gash was cut across 24 miles of forests, lawns, roads and farmland. Four days later, a team assembled by the National Weather Service to review the damage and assess forecasting skill walked house to house, trying to gauge the tornado's destructive power more thoroughly. The team was also eager to glean new clues about the most potent class of tornado, which despite decades of storm chasing and improved radar and satellite monitoring remains a deadly enigma. Although meteorologists have greatly improved their understanding of how certain conditions generate especially powerful thunderstorms and how these towering heat engines can spin out twisters, the experts have yet to figure out what ingredients spawn an F-5. ''This is still fundamentally one of the things we can't predict,'' said Dr. Harold E. Brooks, a research meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. ''I'm not even sure we know what measurements we need to take to try to understand them.'' [A potent tornado killed two people on Sunday in Happy, Tex. Meteorologists had not yet finished analyzing its strength by Monday evening.] Some twisters explode from unremarkable thunderheads, and then there are towering supercells, thunderstorms that are tornado makers, that pass without incident, said Thomas P. Grazulis, a meteorologist and the author of ''The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm,'' published last year. ''Progress is incredibly slow, because you have three or four case studies a year,'' he said. ''But they all turn out to be different.'' The meteorologists and engineers who gathered here were looking for physical manifestations of the storm's intensity, assessing the sturdiness of shattered houses and the distance traveled by heavy objects. It is no simple task, because every building is built differently and responds to wind differently. Also, damage is just partly a function of wind. More often, it results from objects carried in the air. ''Pure wind doesn't do the damage,'' said Timothy P. Marshall, a structural engineer and meteorologist at an engineering firm in Houston and a volunteers in federal studies of tornado damage. ''The churning debris acts like a blender.'' Another complication is storm speed. Slow-moving tornadoes can be particularly devastating: they grind away, sometimes for minutes at a time. One F-5 in Texas stayed on top of a house for three minutes, Mr. Marshall said, adding: ''They never had a chance. Trees were completely shredded. The road pavement was gone. The ground was gone.'' The destruction of a building, too, is not just a result of a storm, but also of the quality of construction. In and around La Plata, many houses -- old and new -- did not appear well built, Mr. Marshall said, with frames weakly connected to foundations. The official determination of the intensity will not be released for many weeks. The F scale for tornadoes mainly considers damage, not wind speed. It was devised in 1971 by Dr. T. Theodore Fujita, a Japanese-born meteorologist and damage expert whose first experience investigating a disaster zone was at Hiroshima. In going from wimpy, almost inconsequential F-0 to devastating F-5, Dr. Fujita, who died in 1998 after a long career at the University of Chicago, nearly ran out of descriptive terms. The most potent storms produce ''incredible phenomena,'' Dr. Fujita wrote. Among those, he said, ''automobile-size missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 meters'' and sturdy houses are ''lifted off foundations and swept away.'' In this town of 6,500 people and the other blasted parts of Charles County along the tornado's 24-mile path, incredible phenomena occurred. La Plata's water tower crumpled like a stomped daddy longlegs. The tornado destroyed 344 houses and businesses. But just steps outside its quarter-mile-wide path, unscathed tulips nodded in the breeze. The randomness and unpredictability of what survives and what is pulverized after such tornadoes is an echo of the persistent unpredictability of the most powerful storms themselves, experts say. Generally, conditions are prime when cool dry air flows over warm, moist air near the surface, setting up turbulent conditions in which air masses clash. In the biggest storms, or supercells, the air rotates as updrafts burst toward the stratosphere. These effects can create whirling vortexes deep inside a storm that, if jogged just right, push down toward the ground, as well as up into the sky. Finding the right trigger at the right time is the trick that keeps the giant storms rare. Together, F-5's and F-4's, which create damage that Dr. Fujita described as merely ''devastating,'' account for 1 percent or so of the 1,000 tornadoes that form in the United States each year. Just 10 percent are F-2 or higher. In what many experts say is the definitive analysis of accounts of past tornadoes, Mr. Grazulis, who runs the Tornado Project, a business centered on tornado lore in St. Johnsbury, Vt., cites a storm that exploded through Christian, Ill., on April 24, 1880, as the first American F-5. The destruction is mainly focused in the Midwest and South, across a zone called Tornado Alley where cool dry Canadian air often clashes with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. But the destruction extends as far north as Saskatchewan and -- now -- as far east as Maryland. For Tom Posey Sr., 72, a lifelong resident, the meaning of F-5, his personal ''incredible phenomenon,'' was the utter disintegration of Posey's, a grocery store that his kin ran in a 40-year-old building that he owned. He kicked at the rubble and supervised two young men as they removed a safe. The roof was long gone, and the walls only vaguely represented by flung, shattered cinder blocks. Incredibly, some sets of shelves still stood, still holding bottles of salad dressing and jars of spaghetti sauce. The sign out front, which had adjustable plastic letters that before the storm had advertised a special on a Maryland delicacy, stuffed ham, was ragged, but still stood. Mr. Posey pointed out that someone had rearranged the letters that had not blown away. One side of the sign now displayed, ''We Are Tuff.''"
"In its storied history, the schooner Ernestina, a 108-year-old tall ship, has survived trips to the Arctic, a fire that sank it in 1947, a storm that tore off a mast in 1976 and even Hurricane Grace, which collided with a northeaster in October 1991 to form the so-called Perfect Storm. Yesterday, the ship survived yet another ordeal, when the Coast Guard saved it from sinking in Block Island Sound. The 112-foot wooden schooner, which has been designated a national landmark and is now the official vessel of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, began taking on water shortly after departing New London, Conn., on its way to Nantucket. On board were 15 crew members and 13 students participating in a continuing education program through the University of Massachusetts in Boston. The Ernestina's pumps could not contain the flooding, and a mayday call went out shortly after 7:30 a.m. Coast Guard rescue boats from New London and Montauk and a helicopter from Cape Cod reached the ship within half an hour and provided extra pumps that helped stabilize it. No one was injured, and the Ernestina was safely escorted to a shipyard in Greenport, N.Y. Lt. Bill Bellaty, the commander of the H-60 Jayhawk helicopter that came from Cape Cod, said that from the air the Ernestina was clearly in distress. ''It was stable, but you could see that it was sitting pretty low in the water,'' he said. ''If the Coast Guard hadn't got the pumps, if the small boats hadn't got there, it probably would have been in big trouble.'' Lieutenant Bellaty added, ''I think the boat very well may not have made it.'' Built in Essex, Mass., and originally launched as the Effie M. Morrissey in February 1894, the Ernestina has been a fishing boat, an expeditionary vessel to the Arctic, a Navy supplier and a trading ship, carrying people and cargo between New England and the Cape Verde Islands off Africa. A fire in 1947 sank the schooner while it was docked in Flushing, Queens, but it was raised and rebuilt. After the storm in 1976 that tore off the mast, the Cape Verde government rebuilt it and gave it to the United States as a gift. It was designated a landmark in 1986, and received a Coast Guard license as a sailing school in 1994. The ship is now used for a variety of educational and cultural programs. The Ernestina sailed from New Bedford, Mass., Monday to begin a seven-day program sponsored by the University of Massachusetts in Boston. On Tuesday, it docked in New London for the annual National Marine Educators Association conference along with three other historic ships. The ship was going to take some conference participants to Mystic, but bad weather kept all boats in port. Yesterday morning, the Ernestina left New London expecting to reach Nantucket by Friday. The passengers and crew had just sat down to breakfast when a routine check revealed a heavy leak at the fore of the vessel, said Gregg Swanzey, the Ernestina's executive director, in an interview from New Bedford. ''Normally,'' Mr. Swanzey said, ''it's a dry boat.'' Mr. Swanzey was the captain of the Ernestina in 1991 when it was off Cape Hatteras, N.C., heading to Bermuda, as Hurricane Grace began churning north. The ship sailed through part of the Perfect Storm. Crew members were close enough to hear the emergency transmissions to the Anna Christina, a sailboat with nine people aboard, who were rescued off Virginia. But as Mr. Swanzey said, ''We didn't make the book.'' Yesterday morning, the Ernestina was briefly out of communication. Eventually the Ernestina's captain, Sophia Morse, was able to send Mr. Swanzey an e-mail message reporting that everything was fine. ''My heart was in my throat there for a while,'' Mr. Swanzey said."
"Paul Terry Dardar's mobile home perches on stilts eight feet high. He has never trusted land. ''I was raised in the water, and my daddy was raised in the water, and my granddaddy -- well, I don't know if I had a granddaddy, but he was probably raised in the water,'' said Mr. Dardar, a fisherman and one of about 230 people who live on this tiny island amid the marshes and bays of southern Louisiana. ''My daddy died in his boat,'' he said. ''Died happy. The water's not done me no harm. Catch a fish, catch a crab. Done me good.'' The water, he said, is a permanent thing. It is the land that is temporary. ''Ain't much of it left,'' he said. Isle de Jean Charles is being swallowed by the water that surrounds it. A ridge of dry ground that rises just a few feet above the brackish water of Terrebonne Parish, it is slowly sinking -- along with the rest of coastal Louisiana -- into the Gulf of Mexico. The people who live here, most of them poor, have watched it shrink year by year, seeing gardens, baseball sandlots and backyards vanish and shade trees wither into gray stumps from the infusion of saltwater. About all that is left is a single street lined with small houses and mobile homes, and people who measure the land not in lots or acres, but feet and inches. The residents, Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians whose ancestors first bought land here in 1876, say the land seems to dwindle on every receding tide, and is only about a fourth the size it was when its oldest residents were children. ''We're washing away,'' said Pierre Naquin, a retired tugboat captain whose family has lived on the island for 126 years. Like the other people here, his accent is Cajun, more music than language, and as he talks about life here it sounds like a sad, sweet song. The island is just a speck on a coastline that has had its protective marshes eaten away by encroaching saltwater, a result of levees, canals and other coastal constructions that altered the natural flow of water that trickles south from the Mississippi. Unable to rebuild itself naturally with silt from that great river, much of the coastline is sinking, and the denuded marshes, a natural buffer to hurricanes, have left the state more vulnerable than ever to a catastrophic storm. But few places in Louisiana are so at risk as the Isle de Jean Charles. Federal officials, who are planning a huge hurricane levee to protect several towns here, will not even try to save this island. The proposed hurricane levee, which would stand as high as 14 feet and stretch more than 70 miles through Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes, would be built to the north of the Isle de Jean Charles, leaving it unprotected. ''They're just going to let it get us,'' said Mr. Naquin, 61. A report by the Army Corps of Engineers said that the levee would cost about $680 million and could be completed no sooner than 2020. Carolyn Earle, a senior project manager with the corps, said extending that levee to include the Isle de Jean Charles would cost $100 million more. ''We were unable to economically justify including Isle de Jean Charles in that plan,'' Ms. Earle said. Instead, the report suggests relocating the people of the island -- at a cost of $8 million -- to someplace behind that proposed levee. But in a meeting of the Army corps and residents this month, most people said they would rather live ankle-deep in muck than abandon a place they have lived for generations. ''We can't force anybody to relocate,'' Ms. Earle said. To an outsider, it might not seem much worth saving. Of the some 60 houses that cluster around the single road, many are water-damaged and some are abandoned, their doors left open, windows broken. An engine block rusts in a ditch, a fishing boat sails in the weeds. In one yard, now covered with water, a tire swing hangs from a dying tree. Only the wind pushes it now. Children walk up the only street, walk down it, then repeat the process. There is little else for them to do, say the people here. The population has gradually gotten older, tribal elders say. There is little reason for young people to stay on an island where the future, like the ground, is so limited. Once, small fields of bean, squash, corn and tomatoes -- even small pastures for dairy cows -- lay behind the houses, said Mr. Naquin. Now, what little spare ground is left is laced with salt, unfit to plant. Construction of several pipelines around the island and the cutting of nearby canals to service oil and gas vessels have broken up the surrounding marsh and accelerated the erosion. The island is down to one road about two miles long, and less than 100 usable acres. But perhaps the weakest link to the island's future is the road that connects it to the outside world. The road, really a thin causeway, vanishes underwater in storms. At high tide, water laps at the edge of the asphalt, making it seem as if the road is paved on the water itself. Once, it ran across marsh and even dry ground. Now, the gulf has rushed in to bury the land, and has all but claimed the road itself. Why would anyone insist on staying, in such a tenuous place? ''I get to hear the wind blow,'' said Chris Brunet, who serves on the community council. The island is neither a federally protected reservation nor an incorporated city. Albert Naquin, Pierre Naquin's brother, is the chief of the island, a title passed down from elder to elder for more than 100 years. He has compared the government's proposal to exclude the island from the hurricane levee's protection to the Trail of Tears, the government's removal of the Cherokee from their homes in the Southeastern United States in the late 1830's. American soldiers led the Cherokee on a forced march to Oklahoma. By leaving the people outside the levee's protection, the government is saying that the lives of the people here do not hold the same value as others, the chief said. Some of the people here are shrimpers and fishermen, some are on federal assistance, and some drive across the causeway to blue-collar jobs in the parish. ''They don't need much land,'' said the chief. ''What they have won't last much longer.'' But the older residents can live out their lives here on the shrinking ground, he said, unless a hurricane devastates the island. Moving the people will only force them to fight the old battles of poverty in a strange place, the people here say. ''This is the best they'll ever have,'' said Chief Naquin. The possibility of a catastrophic hurricane has been on the minds of residents here, and the New Orleans newspaper, The Times-Picayune, has devoted several days of coverage to the causes and the consequences. Mr. Brunet said it was incorrect to predict the death of the island. The local levee board has proposed building a smaller levee that will protect the island from tidal surges. It would not offer significant resistance to a hurricane, but the smaller levee would slow erosion on the island. ''We still got something good,'' Mr. Brunet said. The bayous and marshes and open water are still a haven for fish and shrimp and crabs, although the saltwater intrusion is changing the ecology of the coast. Sport fishermen pull redfish and drum from the water, and white plastic Purex and Chlorox bottles bob in the shallows, each one tied to a crab trap that rests on the bottom. Sarah Dardar lives in a small wooden house. Water licks against the back of it. It is the only home she has ever had, or wants. ''If we decide to stay until the water washes us away, so be it,'' she said. She says she does not have any friends here. ''Just family,'' she said. That is almost everybody. Others have given up. Ray Hendon, who recently moved away, said he was getting tired of walking in the water, and driving in it when he went to work across the often-flooded causeway. The saltwater is hard on a car. ''Ate up my Firenza,'' he said. Others say they will be here forever, even after the last scrap of land is flooded over. ''That's why I got the damn boat,'' said Paul Terry Dardar, the fisherman. He does not even need dry land for a grave. ''Let the fishes eat,'' he said. ''I ain't worried, me.''"
"It's Not Size, but Color There is something about a man with long hair. Just go to a Yanni concert and you'll see. There is something about a male lion with long hair, too, though not, perhaps, what might be expected. A study of African lions shows that a long mane does little for females -- although it does intimidate other males. For a female, color is more important. Peyton West and Dr. Craig Packer of the University of Minnesota wanted to know more about manes, particularly their costs and benefits from an ecological perspective. They conducted field experiments in two regions of Tanzania and analyzed photographs and behavioral information from the same locales obtained over more than 30 years. Their study appeared in the journal Science. In the experiments, the researchers set out lifelike dummy lions with manes of varying length and color and attracted real lions with recorded sounds of hyenas scavenging at a kill. On spotting the dummies, female lions approached those with dark manes far more often than those with light ones, but showed no particular preference for long or short manes. By contrast, males always chose light-maned dummies over dark, and they appeared to be thoroughly intimidated by long manes, approaching short-maned models nine out of 10 times. Blood tests showed that dark manes were associated with high testosterone levels, which generally makes for a more aggressive male, one who fights and eats better and therefore could be expected to defend his family better. So, the researchers say, it is not surprising that the females would seek out, and other males would avoid, males with darker manes. A short mane, on the other hand, is an indication of a past serious injury, which may not matter much to the females but would appear to be a sign of weakness to other males. Hurricane Post-Mortem For weather watchers, a ritual of the hurricane season is following the constant upgradings of storms, from a tropical depression to a tropical storm, say, or from a Category 2 hurricane to a Category 4. Well, Hurricane Andrew was upgraded last week, from a Category 4 to a Category 5, a catastrophic worst-case storm. Hurricane Andrew? Yes, Andrew, which bowled over South Florida in late August 1992. Belatedly, meteorologists from the National Hurricane Center have revised their estimate of the storm's fury, saying its winds when it came ashore were 165 miles an hour, 20 miles an hour higher than previously thought and 10 miles an hour over the Category 5 threshold. Andrew now joins Camille, in 1969, and a hurricane in the Florida Keys in 1935 as the sole Category 5 storms to hit the United States. Meteorologists based the revision on a new understanding of the interiors and dynamics of hurricanes, particularly the relationship between winds on the ground -- which were not recorded when Andrew hit, because the storm destroyed or otherwise overwhelmed most instruments -- and winds at the top, which aircraft measured. For anyone who remembers Andrew -- which killed 55 people and caused $25 billion in damage -- the upgrading may seem meaningless. But forecasters say it is important that past disasters be accurately measured to help with planning. A Rocket With Lineage The first of a new generation of expendable rockets has been successfully launched at Cape Canaveral. The Atlas 5, the newest and largest in a line of rockets that dates from NASA's first piloted orbital flights, was launched on Wednesday, putting a European communications satellite in orbit. The Atlas 5, 190 feet high, is made for quick-turnaround launchings. Its manufacturer, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, says the rocket can be delivered to a launching pad as few as 12 hours before a launching. Observatory"
"Dot Wilson knows how bad the Big One could be. When Hurricane Betsy hit New Orleans in 1965 with 125 m.p.h. winds, leaving 75 dead in Louisiana and South Florida, she walked more than a mile in chest-high water, holding her infant daughter overhead. But when Ms. Wilson held a hurricane-preparedness teach-in recently at the community center she heads, attendance was sparse. ''A lot of people don't see storms as serious,'' she said with a sigh. But people who have been around for a while know better, she said, adding, ''We saw the bodies.'' New Orleans -- home to the French Quarter's iron-latticed buildings and the Garden District's stately Greek Revival mansions, to Preservation Hall jazz and Mardi Gras parades -- may be America's most architecturally distinctive and culturally rich city. But it is also a disaster waiting to happen. New Orleans is the only major American city below sea level, and it is wedged between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi. If a bad hurricane hit, experts say, the city could fill up like a cereal bowl, killing tens of thousands and laying waste to the city's architectural heritage. If the Big One hit, New Orleans could disappear. In Italy, where Venice is facing similar extinction, the national government has begun a $3 billion project to save the city. But in the United States, where fraudulent savings and loans get bailouts and cities fend for themselves, Washington is lying low. It has even been hard to generate concern among residents of this preternaturally carefree town. But New Orleans is, like Venice, a national treasure. Washington, Baton Rouge and New Orleans should work together, and quickly, to come up with a plan to ensure the city's survival. New Orleans's location was a triumph of romance over practicality. The French explorer who founded the city was so enraptured by this crescent-shaped stretch of the lower Mississippi that he ignored the naysayers, one of whom warned that it was ''often flooded and filled with alligators, serpents and other venomous beasts.'' The result was a beautiful city, but a waterlogged one. Burials had to be above ground because gravediggers found they quickly struck water. New Orleans has struggled with water ever since. A 475-mile system of levees and locks along the river and lake holds back the water, and a network of pumps works full time moving water up and out. But the city is sinking as the soil under it settles, and sea levels are rising. And the coastal marsh and barrier islands, which form a protective wall against hurricanes, are being eaten away. There is considerable agreement about what the Big One would look like. A Category 4 or 5 hurricane would move up from the Gulf to Lake Pontchartrain, forcing lake water over levees and into the city. If the New Orleans ''bowl'' filled, the Red Cross says, there could be 100,000 deaths. An additional 400,000 could be stranded on roofs, surrounded by a witches' brew of contaminated water. Property loss estimates run as high as $150 billion, though much of the imperiled architecture -- like the St. Louis Cathedral -- is priceless. So far, Washington has done little, and New Orleans's response has been less than satisfying. The city is focused on evacuating its 500,000 residents. But the roads leading out would flood quickly, stranding those who lingered. Then there is the thorny issue of the 100,000 residents without cars. ''When I do presentations,'' said Terry Tullier, head of the New Orleans Office of Emergency Preparedness, ''I start by saying that 'when the Big One comes, many of you will die -- let's get that out of the way.' '' Mr. Tullier has seen computer models of Canal Street under 20 feet of water and heard that the floodwaters could stay for weeks, that the National Guard might bring in thousands of body bags -- and that New Orleans might never recover. ''In this business, we bring no good news,'' he said. ''It's full of worst-case scenarios.'' One proposal for saving New Orleans calls for building a wall 20 to 30 feet high across the city to hold back the lake water. It would stop flooding in the French Quarter and other areas but could mean writing off half the city. Another idea is a $14 billion project to save coastal wetlands; that would help with the city's problems, but wouldn't solve them. The Army Corps of Engineers is studying the idea of raising the lake levees. But it will be hard to get money for these projects out of Washington, where disaster dollars are being earmarked for homeland security. There are a few voices trying to shake New Orleans out of its complacency. The Times-Picayune ran a hurricane series this summer, and academics have spoken out, Cassandra-like, for years. An advocate for the elderly recently warned that those who stayed behind in a storm could expect to be ''surrounded by water contaminated with dead animals, insects, snakes, garbage and sewage.'' But getting this city of tropical instincts to take hurricanes seriously is a challenge. The New Orleans motto is ''laissez les bons temps rouler'' -- let the good times roll. And as anyone who has strolled down Bourbon Street can attest, the first meaning of ''hurricane'' here is an icy concoction of liquor and fruit juices. The city's other pull is toward languor. Blanche DuBois was describing New Orleans afternoons when she said ''an hour isn't just an hour -- but a little piece of eternity dropped in your hands.'' There is no telling when the Big One will hit, but since some of the worst storms come in early September, now would be a good time to get ready. As it happens, New Orleans is about to give serious thought to hurricanes. In a few weeks, thousands will gather at the Southern Comfort New Orleans Hurricane Festival, a musical party on the Mississippi -- named after the drink. Editorial Observer"
"As Tropical Storm Isidore chugged up the Gulf of Mexico, slowly losing steam, one Tulane student circulated a bulletin on the Internet: ''Ingredients for throwing hurricane parties,'' it began. ''1. Everyone must be panicking and boarding up windows: this allows for maximum shock value. ''2. The drink: Hurricanes, of course (preferably Pat O'Brien's mix). ''3. Decorations: This depends on electricity. If it's still on, Christmas lights. If not, lots and lots of candles.'' Lesson No. 1 in the Crescent City: you don't need a hurricane to have a hurricane party. The tropical storm, which battered Mexico, did not reach hurricane strength before arriving tonight. But across New Orleans, in houses with windows drawn tight, in steamy bars and ripe-smelling dorm rooms, people dutifully obeyed another of the city's quirky codes: They clinked glasses behind plywood-covered windows. They said prayers to their patron saints. And they remembered the words of their ancestors: ''Enjoy the wind, enjoy the wind.'' ''Ah, my old papère, he loved hurricanes,'' Mel Schiro, a 12th generation New Orleanian, said of her grandfather. ''When the storm would come, papere would tell us to invite everyone we knew and throw a big party. Isn't that wonderful?'' With classes canceled, shops shut, streets clogged and weather lousy, the hurricane party is actually a very practical approach to a big storm, many explained. ''What are you gonna do, sit around and watch the rain?'' said Laurie Frenette, a tourist from Rochester, N.Y., as she sipped a hurricane, a pinkish, happy-looking cocktail. The drink, by the way, was first concocted here in World War II at Pat O'Brien's, a French Quarter bar. It is four ounces rum and four ounces top secret hurricane mix. As the rain streamed down today, the joie de vivre did not extend to those in charge. Public officials across the area rushed into emergency operations centers to hunker down in rooms aglow with computer monitors and the hypnotic graphics of The Weather Channel. Isidore was much less powerful than originally expected. Still, the storm deposited inches of rain across the Gulf Coast, knocking down trees and washing out some roads. Low-lying areas around New Orleans were flooded, forcing out thousands of people. The Super Dome became a makeshift shelter. A foot of rain had fallen by midnight, closing several dowtown streets. A curfew was in effect until sunrise, and the airport was partly closed. Jimmie Anderson, deputy director for emergency preparedness for Orleans Parish, was optimistic but said: ''There's still a lot to do. We ain't partying yet.'' New Orleans is uniquely vulnerable to flooding. The city sits below sea level, and it is surrounded by a high wall, the levee system. It is like a bowl, and if water gets over the wall, there is no place for it to go. ''If we had a storm, the right storm, and water crested the levees, it would be a catastrophe,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''The whole city would be underwater.'' To prevent this, the city has dozens of pumps the size of locomotives that suck water from drainage canals and spit it back into lakes and rivers. As dusk came and rain began to collect on Bourbon Street, a few tourists ventured out. Shopkeepers leaned in their doorways. A man playing a saxophone blasted a slow song as droplets of water gathered on his hair and slid down his sax. New Orleans is a beautiful city when wet. The cobbles shine, the wrought iron balconies look as if they were just painted, and the air has a freshly-washed quality. The quiet was partly deceptive. Most hurricane parties unfold behind shuttered doors, locals said, after families and businesses have sealed up their properties. Students at Tulane University had been warned not to throw hurricane parties because they can be dangerous. But few seemed to listen. ''We've been waiting forever to do this,'' said Ashley Lord, the Tulane sophomore who put together the hurricane party checklist. ''And just because it's a tropical storm, doesn't mean the party's off.'' Meanwhile, in a big house uptown, Mrs. Schiro, 63, went over her list. ''Apple-turnovers, pound cake, pecan bread, banana bread, beer, tuna salad, ham salad,'' and then she stopped for a second. ''And beer. Lots of beer. Did I forget that?'' New Orleans Journal"
"As the clouds began to swirl away and the rain began to slacken, many residents here peeked out their screen doors today to survey their post-Isidore world. It was bad -- not horrible, but bad. Parts of Interstate 10 and several main streets were flooded, dozens of homes had two feet of nasty brown water in them, cars sat abandoned in mammoth puddles, and snapped off tree limbs dangled from power lines. Though the Tropical Storm Isidore never became the potent hurricane originally predicted, the storm dumped two feet of rain in some areas, and as predicted, flooding was the biggest problem. ''It was depressing,'' said Kent Burgess, owner of a seafood restaurant along Lake Pontchartrain. ''First there was this little trickle coming in through the front door. I'd mop it up and it would go away. But then the water kept coming. And coming. Finally, I had to leave.'' The storm, which pummeled the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico earlier in the week, wobbled ashore around 3 a.m., punishing the waterfront communities along the Gulf Coast. In Houma, La., a housing project was inundated with water after two of four pumps in the area stopped working because power was out. Hundreds of residents fled to a shelter. The water still had not cleared today, and some people stroked canoes down city streets this afternoon. In Biloxi, Miss., 10-foot waves crashed into casinos floating along the coast. In the Florida Panhandle, several tornadoes touched down, damaging some homes. Power failures affected more than 200,000 people. Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana said the storm did at least $18 million in damage in his state, including $3.7 million in lost sugar cane. New Orleans was one of the areas hardest hit because the storm stalled for a few hours over the city, which is below sea level. Enormous pumps were working through the night to keep up with the rain. Tidal flooding was also a problem and several neighborhoods north of New Orleans had to be evacuated after rising tides caused Lake Pontchartrain to overflow. A levee also broke in the area, creating a flash flood that sent water sloshing into dozens of homes. Forecasters predicted that the storm would move into the Ohio Valley and dump heavy rain in the Midwest and the Northeast. But as the skies cleared Thursday, many officials said things were better than expected. ''We're feeling relieved,'' said Chief Terry Tullier of the Orleans Parish Office of Emergency Management. ''We saw what it did to Mexico. And now it's come and basically just dropped a lot of rain. It could have been a lot of worse.'' Even at the storm's height, as the rain fell in sheets and the winds picked up to 55 miles an hour, the revelry did not stop along historic and rowdy Bourbon Street. Many bars threw hurricane parties. One reveler splashed through the mud puddles, wearing nothing but a garbage bag. Another danced under a cascading downspout, yelling: ''Isidore! Come and get me!''"
"With Tropical Storm Isidore spinning around the Yucatán peninsula and forecasts predicting it would intensify into a hurricane and slam into the Gulf Coast, Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana declared a state of emergency today. The storm, which has spent the past three days shredding trees and flipping boats in Mexico and Cuba, was expected to hit the southern United States on Thursday. ''Hurricane Isidore poses an imminent threat,'' Governor Foster said in a statement. ''Immediate emergency action may be required to minimize the effects of this impending disaster.'' Several computer models show the storm racing up the Gulf of Mexico, gathering strength from warm gulf waters, then making landfall near Vermilion Parish, a rural fishing and shrimping area 150 miles southwest of New Orleans. Forecasters predicted that Isidore's winds could reach 92 miles an hour by the time it neared the Louisiana coast, bringing with it driving rain and severe flooding. But with the storm still 500 miles away, the storm's path and intensity remained far from certain. Officials in coastal Louisiana were not taking chances, and began to plan for evacuations. Shelters were checked, road closures planned and alternative power sources lined up. ''We'll wait one more night before we make the big decision,'' said Dick Gremillion, directory of emergency preparedness for Calcasieu Parish, in southwest Louisiana. ''But unless Isidore takes a drastic turn, we'll be looking at an evacuation.'' The state of emergency allows the governor to mobilize the National Guard and help local governments pay for emergency preparation. Already, the authorities in many parishes were appearing on radio and television, warning residents to monitor the weather forecast closely. Heavy rains were expected to begin on Wednesday. Despite the official tone of concern, many residents in southern Louisiana seemed almost nonchalant about the storm. Here in Houma, 60 miles southwest of New Orleans, there was no run on plywood to cover windows, no wheeling of bottled water from the grocery store, no rush to buy candles or batteries -- at least, not yet. For many residents, preparing for a hurricane is like getting out of bed in the morning: you don't move unless you have to. ''It's still sooooo far away,'' said David Bergeron, a retiree picking up dinner at Rouses Supermarket. ''I'm not going to worry about it till it gets closer.'' Mike Conklin, an oyster seller, held up two cases of beer. ''This is how I'm going to prepare for the storm,'' he said, laughing. Some Houma residents, though, were starting to batten down the hatches. Melinda Vail, a manager at Jug's Seafood, spent this afternoon shipping out soft-shell crabs. ''And I'm not going to order any more till the storm passes,'' she said. ''This could be dangerous.'' Her house, like so many others in southern Louisiana, sits just feet from a swollen bayou on a road just inches higher than the water on a normal day. When there is a lot of rain, the bayou floods, often closing the road in front of her house. In Texas, oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from off-shore drilling platforms. ''Basically at this point we've evacuated all nonessential personnel,'' said Larry Thomas, a spokesman for BP America. ''We've secured all our drilling operations on contract rigs. And there's another storm brewing in the Caribbean where some models bring it into the Gulf. It will be an interesting week for us.'' Isidore's approach was felt along some parts of coastal Texas, Chief Warrant Officer Rob Wyman, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said. ''Already some heavy winds and heavy seas have been reported to the Coast Guard in South Padre,'' he said."
"The government said today that it would extend the range of its hurricane forecasts starting this season, to five days from three. It said the change, enabled by improvements in forecast performance, would be of particular help to agencies and coastal businesses requiring more time to move equipment and take other precautions before the onset of the most violent storms. Meteorologists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made the announcement at a news conference at the agency's National Hurricane Center in Miami. They said the extended forecasts would take effect on May 15, the official start of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season. The season begins two weeks later in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. The agency said the two chief reasons for the change were improved forecast performance and requests from the Navy and other organizations. ''Our five-day forecasts today are as accurate as our three-day forecasts of 15 years ago,'' said Max B. Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center. The Navy, offshore oil drillers and NASA, which relies on storm forecasts for spacecraft launchings, are among those expected to benefit most. ''We were asked by the Navy in particular to extend our forecasts,'' said Dr. James R. Mahoney, assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere. ''This will allow for advanced planning and positioning of equipment.'' Eight tropical storms affected the coastal United States last year. Four became hurricanes, but only one, Hurricane Lili, made landfall, hitting the Louisiana coast in early October after rapidly weakening. Officials attribute last year's relatively low number of hurricanes to the strengthening of El Niño, a warming of Pacific waters that can lead to increased rainfall but can also suppress hurricane activity. Mr. Mayfield predicts that this year, El Niño will fade by peak hurricane season, from late August to mid-October. But it is still too early to tell, he said, how many hurricanes may hit the United States this year, or how severe they will be."
"THE strongest winds of a hurricane are in its eyewall, the swirling complex of clouds and rain that rotate around the eye of the storm. Until recently, only a few measurements had been made of the force these huge winds exert near the ocean's surface, an important element in determining the intensity of a hurricane. Instead, forecasters estimated the strength of the wind under the eyewall when they predicted hurricane effects like storm surges. Now, using data delivered by gadgets that can withstand a hurricane eyewall, a team of researchers has measured in detail the wind's speed at different altitudes at times when there are high winds near the ocean's surface. The researchers, lead by Dr. Mark D. Powell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane research division in Miami, analyzed data collected in 15 hurricanes by more than 300 of the windproof devices, called dropwind sondes or sondes. The small, instrument-packed cylinders, each equipped with a parachute, were released into the eyewall from planes flying at altitudes up to 10,000 feet. The sondes radioed measurements every half second to the plane until they landed in the ocean. The data collected by the sondes -- mostly in the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico -- may lead scientists to revise their models for hurricane intensity. ''We've never had any measurements in high winds over about 50 knots to see how the wind changes when it's very close to the surface,'' Dr. Powell said. Instead, scientists extrapolated values based on weaker wind speeds. Now the new findings, published in the March 20 issue of Nature, suggest that some of these extrapolations were wrong. ''We've always thought that drag or resistance increases with sea surface roughness and wind speed,'' Dr. Powell said. But when the team analyzed the sonde data, they found that the ocean caused less, not more, resistance in winds above hurricane force. James L. Franklin, a hurricane forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, helped design the sondes that gathered the data for the study and has himself published on hurricane structures revealed by drop-sonde data. The battery-powered gadgets, which cost about $550 each, are equipped with Global Positioning System modules, as well as sensors to measure temperature, pressure and humidity. The instruments within the sondes transmit to the plane twice a second as they fall. ''Since the sonde is falling at about 30 feet per second,'' Mr. Franklin said, ''you get data every 15 feet, meaning very detailed information.'' As the sonde, supported by its parachute, is carried along with the wind before it hits the ocean, ''the G.P.S. tells us how fast the sonde is moving,'' he said, ''so that if we measure sonde motion, we are at the same time measuring air motion.'' The sonde's electronics board includes a microprocessor that receives the raw information from its sensors. It processes the signals and sends them to its transmitter, which radios the information to the accompanying plane. From the plane, scientists like Mr. Franklin monitor the data before sending it to a computer at the National Weather Service in Washington. ''From there,'' Mr. Franklin said, ''the data are relayed to the National Hurricane Center and then distributed globally'' so that forecasters can use the information immediately in their projections. The transmission time from hurricane eyewall to forecasting center is brief. ''From when the sonde is kicked out of the airplane until we receive the data at a forecast center, it's only 10 to 15 minutes,'' Mr. Franklin said. Gary Barnes, a professor in the department of meteorology at the University of Hawaii, said that the sonde study showed what could happen when people bring new instruments to an old problem. ''Often a few good measurements will derail an accepted theory,'' Dr. Barnes said, ''or at least trigger major modifications.'' He predicted that the data would cause scientists who simulate hurricanes to revise their calculations. ''If the drag coefficient is lower than what was assumed under and near the eyewall,'' he said, ''then we are losing less wind energy to the sea.'' That would mean that winds are higher at the surface than was generally assumed. ''If the drag coefficient is less, then our standard ways of estimating heat and evaporation from the sea surface need to be reconsidered,'' he added. Dr. Powell and others think that the ocean's foam may cause the surface to become smoother rather than rougher at extreme winds. ''The wind just blows the tops of the waves off,'' Dr. Powell said, ''injecting spray and more and more air into the ocean.'' By the time the winds surpass 100 knots (about 115 miles per hour), producing waves of 30 feet and more, the ocean surface is completely covered by spray or foam. ''We think it is the foam that is affecting the transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean,'' he said, as the sea surface no longer acts as a brake for the wind. Dr. Barnes agreed that spray might affect hurricane intensity. ''It may be a critical component that is just beginning to be understood,'' he said. Dr. Powell pointed to one limitation in the study: virtually all the data that formed the basis for the report were collected over the open ocean. The sondes weigh a bit less than a pound and are rarely released over land because they could cause damage as they fall from the sky. ''The results are really only valid for storms that are far from the coastline,'' he said. Dr. Powell said that he would be working with the National Hurricane Center and the Air Force to develop ways to release sondes along the coastline when storms approach. He does not plan to be on board to help, though, as the sondes are tossed from planes. ''My stomach doesn't do too well,'' he said. WHAT'S NEXT"
"Hurricane Isabel was an equal-opportunity destroyer, flooding the houses, snapping the trees and cutting the power of rich and poor alike. But the lingering hardships imposed by the storm are not likely to be so democratic, officials from across the region say. People with low or fixed incomes, the elderly and the unemployed are struggling harder to rebuild, the officials say. Many had little or no insurance; many lost everything they owned. Nowhere is that more apparent than in this historic town nestled by Chesapeake Bay, which spilled waist-high water into the streets during the hurricane. Two weeks later, front yards looked like museums of ruined lives, piled high with rusting appliances, wrinkled photographs, sodden clothing and moldering rugs. In the heavily damaged Messick Road neighborhood, populated mainly by watermen and retirees, Poquoson officials estimate that as many as half the residents did not have enough insurance to cover their losses. With little money for hotels, many Messick Road residents have been sleeping on soggy mattresses, in cars, tents or camping trailers, waiting for aid from the government, insurance companies or charities. ''We have retirees who took two feet of water in their homes and everything is gone,'' said Charles W. Burgess Jr., Poquoson's city manager. ''They may get money to make their homes habitable again. And there will be folks who give them food. But replacing their material possessions will be a struggle. They may never get back to where they were.'' James Wilkinson considers himself one of the lucky ones, if only because no one in his family was hurt. But falling trees punched holes in the roof of his clapboard bungalow, while four feet of water warped his floors. Virtually everything his family owned now sits in his yard waiting for the trash collector. One pile contained his daughter's prom dress and his son's stuffed animals. A Santa suit Mr. Wilkinson wore to entertain local children was drying in the sun. A neat row of his wife's shoes sat on the front porch, which had been ripped from the house and lay crumpled in the yard. Mr. Wilkinson, 43, a dock foreman for a seafood company, had insurance, but he cannot be sure his losses will be completely covered. The house is unsafe and must be rebuilt, and he expects he will do much of the work himself. Meanwhile, he and his family are living in his camping trailer in his mother-in-law's driveway, awaiting temporary aid. ''It's been two weeks and I don't have anything,'' he said. ''I need something to keep us going.'' The insurance industry estimates that the storm caused $1 billion in privately insured damage, but the total losses will be four to five times that much, said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-financed group. Part of those costs will be covered by federal flood insurance, he added, but billions more will not. Mr. Hartwig said only about one-fourth of the people who live in known flood areas buy flood insurance. ''Some cite cost,'' he said. ''And some say that they expect federal and state aid, so why buy it?'' Even people who had homeowners or flood insurance are finding in the fine print of their policies that their damages will not all be covered. Some companies, for instance, have higher deductibles for hurricanes. Amid widespread protests about such deductibles, one insurer, USAA, announced this week that it would waive its storm deductibles for policyholders in Virginia and Maryland. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has opened disaster relief offices throughout Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, can provide emergency aid to people who have lost their homes, including money for rent or clothing. The Small Business Administration issues loans to cover damages, including to homes and personal belongings. But the federal government does not provide grants to pay for uninsured losses, officials said. Across the region, government officials and charitable groups were scrambling to help lower-income residents cope with the storm's aftershocks. Dozens of Red Cross and Salvation Army trucks have been providing hot meals in hard-hit neighborhoods. Many cities have set up offices to provide one-month disaster food stamps to eligible residents. And churches in flood-damaged towns have distributed canned goods and second-hand clothing. In Norfolk, Va., 16 miles south of Poquoson, so many people showed up when the city began accepting applications for disaster food stamps that officials moved the site to its sports arena. ''We needed a bigger venue,'' said N. Clark Earl, director of the Department of Human Services in Norfolk. The city has approved more than 12,000 of the applications over six days, Mr. Earl said. On Thursday the line wrapped halfway around the arena, hundreds of people long. Almondo Bryant, 26, showed up with a folding chair when the office opened at 8:30 a.m., only to find himself behind scores of people who had camped out all night. ''I lost a week's pay,'' said Mr. Bryant, who works at a Hardee's restaurant that was closed for five days because of the power failure. ''I've got to scrape by until the next check comes.'' To be sure, things have returned to normal for many people in southeast Virginia. Public schools in most towns reopened this week. Most gas stations were pumping fuel again, and grocery stores had restocked empty shelves. Only about 10,000 homes and businesses were still without power, down from 1.8 million immediately after the storm. Virtually all of those without power were in southeast Virginia, with almost all customers in Maryland and North Carolina restored. Charles Penn, a spokesman for Dominion Virginia Power, said the utility expected to have everyone back on line by this weekend. But in parts of Poquoson, a city of 12,000 people, things were far from normal. More than a week after they returned to their homes, many people were still cleaning out flood debris, ripping out mildew-stained walls and salvaging heirlooms. ''Some things you can't prepare yourself for,'' Kim Messick said on Wednesday as she moved wrecked belongings from her house into her yard. ''Death is one. This is another.'' Carol Mann, who lives in a renovated farmhouse on the same plot occupied by her family for four generations, said many older residents in Poquoson did not believe the hurricane would be so damaging. Many had not bought flood insurance because they were on fixed incomes and could not afford it, or did not think their homes -- some half a mile from the bay -- would ever flood. ''Now they are just walking around in a daze,'' Mrs. Mann, 48, said. ''They were in their houses when the flood came. And they watched everything they own go down the drain.''"
"WHEN people think of hydrangeas, they tend to envision the ubiquitous big-leaf variety that bursts with blue or pink blossoms in summer, or the popular peegee hydrangeas), whose white cones start flowering in fall. But there are others -- hundreds, in fact -- as I discovered during a recent visit to the Norfolk Botanical Garden in Norfolk, Va., whose Kaufman Hydrangea Garden, situated on two acres of open woodland, represents the official national hydrangea collection. Mark Weathington, the Botanical Garden's director of horticulture, said the Kaufman garden's towering trees survived Hurricane Bonnie in 1998 and fared well in the wake of Isabel. Just about all of the garden's 200-plus hydrangeas are also still standing, and eventually he plans to have that number grow to 500. The hydrangeas are grouped by themes, and I immediately headed for the area labeled ''Other Species.'' There, I fell in love with H. involucrata, a shrub three to five feet tall with unusual globe-shaped buds resembling those on a peony. As the first buds open into flowers of lilac to powder blue, new buds continue to form, creating a colorful display for two to three months. The complex flowers, known as lacecaps, have centers that look like tightly packed peppercorns. Radiating around them are small four-petalled flowers, like those on a dogwood. Catalogs typically refer to the somewhat rounded green leaves on H. involucrata as ''velvety.'' But horticulturists have a more apt description for leaves that also have an unappetizingly rough texture, which may discourage deer: ''hairy.'' (Deer are not a problem at the Norfolk garden because it backs onto an international airport and is otherwise surrounded by water.) How hardy is it? One problem with plants new to the trade, including H. involucrata, is that it takes a while for hardiness to be truly known. Descriptions of H. involucrata's hardiness, based on average annual minimum temperatures, vary from zero to minus 20 degrees, but since its flowers are produced on new wood, the shrub can die back to the ground and still flower the next year. To ensure success with this plant in colder areas, place it in a protected spot, like near a wall. While most hydrangeas flower in summer, the lacy white flowers of another uncommon hydrangea, H. luteovenosa Variegata, open in spring. And unlike those on most hydrangeas, these flowers are fragrant. Even in August, when those blossoms were long gone, I was attracted to the shrub's glossy green leaves, which are veined in yellow. It, too, is without established hardiness, though experts agree that it can survive lows of about 10 degrees. Another multiseason shrub, the native oakleaf hydrangea (H. quercifolia), has an established hardiness to minus 20 degrees. Its early summer flowers are white, aging to pink, with foliage that turns red in the fall. Mr. Weathington's personal favorite is the Snowflake cultivar. Just now entering the trade, Snowflake has double flowers -- brilliant white -- set off by sepals that turn a dark purple-pink. The effect is ''absolutely striking,'' as Mr. Weathington put it. Though another native, H. arborescens, is generally regarded as dull, some praise its zeal: It will flower in heavy shade, and it is hardy to minus 30 degrees. Samantha, an H. arborescens subspecies radiata cultivar, belies the stereotype. A shrub three to four feet tall, it explodes with gleaming white snowballs in July. Throughout the growing season, the silver white undercoating on its leaves sparkles in gentle breezes. The Kaufman garden has Samantha and Snowflake in an area labeled Native Species. Other groupings include white flowered cultivars, dwarf hydrangeas and those with unusual foliage and flowers. Still other areas are devoted to showing how alkaline soil changes normally blue hydrangea flowers pink, while acid soil induces blues. Climbing hydrangeas are planted on trees throughout the setting. One of the oddest I saw is simply called H. seemanii. An evergreen hydrangea with glossy magnolia-like leaves, it has oval buds that turn into showy white lacecap flowers. Discovered in the Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico, it is known to be hardy to 10 degrees and has been reported to do fine in protected locations where temperatures drop to zero. Now is an excellent time to plant hydrangeas, and with so many to choose from, a great time to try something different.

"Thunderstorms kill twice as many men as women, a new study has found. The gender gap is biggest for lightning strikes; 85 percent of those killed are men. But it also applies to deaths from flooding by storms, tornadoes and high winds, according to the study, which was presented last week at a conference on safety held by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study examined information from local offices of the National Weather Service on 1,442 deaths related to thunderstorms from 1994 to 2000. The lead researcher, Dr. Thomas J. Songer of the University of Pittsburgh, said the study was not intended to determine a reason for the difference. ''But it appears that men may be in outdoor activities more than women'' for work and recreation, Dr. Songer said, ''and that may place them at greater risk.'' Dr. Songer said greater risk-taking might also have a role, adding that the average age of the victims was 35. ''You read a lot of descriptions of men who drive around barricades on flooded roads and don't make it,'' he said. The primary purpose of the study was to compare storm components and the death rates for different activities, in the hope of clarifying safety advice, said Dr. Songer. People, he noted, are told to stay in their cars or to seek low ground to avoid lightning, yet to avoid vehicles and low ground because of floods. Because flood and lightning deaths are close to equal, the overriding message, he said, may be to seek shelter and use common sense based on the setting. ''In Florida, for instance, there is an extremely high rate of lightning deaths,'' he said. ''So the advice there could be to stay low.'' VITAL SIGNS: HAZARDS"
"Six to nine hurricanes are likely to churn the Atlantic or the Caribbean this year, making 2003 the stormiest year since 1999, federal officials said yesterday. They warned coastal communities not to be lulled by the relative calm of recent seasons. Cool Pacific waters and a warm Atlantic ''are more conducive to hurricanes over the Atlantic and stronger ones, as well,'' said Dr. Richard J. Pasch, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Dr. Pasch added that those conditions would probably be most strongly felt in the deep tropics, where the most potent hurricanes form. The Atlantic had four hurricanes last year. One, Lili, struck the United States. No hurricanes hit the mainland in 2001 or 2000. ''Being prepared for hurricane season is key in reducing the loss of life and property,'' Michael D. Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement. ''Knowing what to do when a hurricane strikes takes planning.'' The greater chance of hurricanes comes from a conjunction of conditions that tend to foster tropical storms in the eastern Atlantic and suppress winds from the west that can rip such storms apart, forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Atlantic water temperatures are warmer than usual, providing more energy for developing storms. Also, the storms this year will probably persist longer than usual because there is less contrast between winds high in the atmosphere and those near the sea surface. The contrast, called wind shear, can unravel tropical storms as they expand and blossom upward. Another factor is an expected cooling of the tropical Pacific. When the equatorial Pacific is unusually warm, the phase called El Niño, strong high-level winds pump from the Pacific through the Caribbean and into the Atlantic, dismantling hurricanes and slowing their westward march. When the cool phase settles in, as appears likely this summer, there is no such brake. Scientists said the last year with similar conditions was 1999, when three hurricanes struck the coasts. They included Floyd, which rumbled up the East Coast for four days, leaving $6 billion in damage."
"As Louisiana continues to clean up from Tropical Storm Bill, which knocked out power in 200,000 homes and businesses across the state, New Orleans is bracing for the new hurricane season. Because of its unusual geography, the Big Easy is uniquely vulnerable -- if a powerful enough storm hits, experts warn, the city could be badly damaged and tens of thousands of people could be killed. New Orleans, and the nation, need a better plan for protecting the city. New Orleans is one of the nation's most distinctive cities. Tourists flock to the French Quarter and the Garden District, and to landmarks like Preservation Hall and Jackson Square. What is less well known is that New Orleans is an environmental disaster waiting to happen. The city is located below sea level, and it is surrounded by water -- the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. If New Orleans is ever hit by the Big One, the city could fill up like a bowl. Many residents would be unable to evacuate in time because of crowded escape routes, flooding or lack of access to transportation. The most promising long-term solution is a major effort to restore the area's depleted coastal marsh and barrier islands, which form a natural wall of defense. Louisiana has the nation's highest rate of coastal erosion. Since the 1930's, one million acres of wetlands have been lost, and another million acres could be lost in the next 40 years. During a major hurricane, these coastal buffers could mean the difference between life and death. Louisiana has begun a program called America's Wetland to draw attention to the problem, and to rally environmentalists, businesses and ordinary residents to the cause of restoring marshes and barrier islands. The effort could cost as much as $14 billion in the next 15 to 20 years. It is a considerable sum, but the cost of not acting -- measured in potential damage to New Orleans, and to vital transportation and energy operations in southern Louisiana -- would be greater. The project will be rolled out in stages. Members of Congress, who will be asked to foot much of the bill, should view it as a national priority. New Orleans also has to take more immediate steps to reduce hurricane risks. Serious consideration must be given to a variety of proposals, like raising the height of the levees around New Orleans and building a large, storm-safe structure that could be used as a haven for residents who were unable to leave. Tropical Storm Bill was a warning that it may be only a matter of time before the Big One hits. The time to prepare New Orleans for that frightening prospect is now."
"Power lines twisted in the air and billboards and other debris littered the streets of this seaside town and other communities throughout southern Texas today as Hurricane Claudette broke out of the Gulf of Mexico in a fury of rain and wind. At least two people were killed by falling limbs, a 33-year-old woman in Victoria and a 13-year-old boy in Jourdanton, near San Antonio, The Associated Press reported. Rescue officials reported few serious injuries on the 350-mile-long Texas coast along the gulf, but Coast Guard and security officials reported some close calls, including the rescue of two fishermen, Tony Nguyen and Lam Nguyen, from a 92-foot shrimp boat about five miles from Sabine Pass, at the Louisiana border. ''Physically it was amazing how little injury they had,'' said Jennifer Nguyen, a spokeswoman for Christus St. Mary Hospital in Port Arthur. Ms. Nguyen said that the fishermen were cousins and appeared to be in their mid-30's but that she had no exact age. ''They did lose two dogs. They are really sad about it,'' she said. This storm was the first hurricane to strike Texas since 1999, when Hurricane Bret made landfall between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. A relatively light Category 1 hurricane with winds of 74 to 90 miles per hour, Hurricane Claudette still mustered enough force to inflict serious property damage as far inland as Victoria, a city at the crossroads between San Antonio, Houston and Corpus Christi. In Victoria and the nearby town of Goliad, some streets were covered with leveled trees, and electrical power remained out well into the evening. ''It was pretty surreal,'' said Jack Whitlock, owner of the Indianola Trading Company, an antiques store here, as he surveyed the main strip of Port Lavaca's downtown, strewn with bricks from a damaged historic building that nearly collapsed. After the worst of the hurricane passed through Port Lavaca this morning, the community of 12,000 seemed like a ghost town with the windows of many businesses boarded up with plywood. Few people here had expected the hurricane to be so forceful. ''I got a hole in my roof the size of a dinner plate,'' Buck Jackson, the owner of a photography studio, said as his son-in-law, Armando Lopez, hammered in a piece of plywood that had flown off the front of the store. For some, the hurricane was a frightful reminder of a tropical storm of the same name in July 1979, which produced a national record of 43 inches of rain in a 24-hour period in Alvin, 20 miles south of Houston. Hurricane Claudette, though, moved relatively quickly before dissipating into a tropical storm this afternoon, preventing large amounts of rainfall over any single area. Houston was relatively unscathed by the storm, with heavy rainfall snarling traffic this morning and causing light flooding in some neighborhoods. In Brazoria County, southwest of Houston and west of Galveston, County Judge John Willy said damage was relatively light, but he said the storm remained a threat, as rain continued in parts of the area. Mr. Willy said people in Brazoria had been hesitant to evacuate despite warnings about the storm. ''We haven't had a major hurricane in about 40 years, since Carla,'' Mr. Willy said. ''We've had several little storms, and what you have with most of them has been a rise of water. This one was probably a good wake-up call.'' The hurricane provided quite a scare for people like Jeff Kluttz, a youth minister at First Baptist Church of Rosenberg. Mr. Kluttz is also a director of OneCamp, a cooperative of Texas churches that organizes religious youth camps. A group of 400 of his campers, ages 12 to 18, arrived in Palacios, 90 miles southwest of Houston, on Monday for a week of games and religious activities, only to find themselves in the direct path of the hurricane. ''We got the worst of it,'' Mr. Kluttz said of the wind and rain battering that the campsite sustained. ''We've got a lot of guys not from the coast,'' he added. ''I told them this is a baby hurricane; it's like the baby dinosaur in 'Jurassic Park.' It may be a baby but it can still hurt you.'' Seeking to stay ahead of the storm, Mr. Kluttz moved the campers late Monday afternoon and evening to Katy, about 20 miles west of Houston. Today, a disaster-relief group called the First Baptist Men of Texas went to the campers' aid, bringing a mobile kitchen in an 18-wheeler truck to provide meals for the weary campers and another truck with mobile showers. For some people in Port Lavaca, however, Hurricane Claudette was pure diversion. Robert Koch, chief field supervisor at a roofing company, drove to Port Lavaca from San Antonio with his two teenage children, Kayla and Robert, to experience the storm first hand. ''For a while there, it felt like pins and needles hitting you nonstop,'' Mr. Koch, dressed in a jumpsuit and cowboy boots, said as he leaned against his red Dodge pickup truck. Disappointed by the relative calm provided by being in the eye of the hurricane as it passed over Port Lavaca around noon today, the Koch family wondered when the wind and rain would resume. ''I'm ready to leave,'' Mr. Koch said, ''but the kids are loving it.''"
"THE new state building code that has placed Long Island in a special high-wind category similar to that of hurricane-battered Southern states requires structural elements that builders say will have a drastic impact on the cost of new houses, as well as remodeling and renovation work on existing homes. The new code requires windows that must pass a ''missile test'' for high winds and wind-borne debris. Such windows are currently being specially designed for Long Island and are expected to cost more than twice as much as standard windows because they must also meet the state's energy-efficiency criteria. ''The new code is a step in the right direction, but it could triple the cost of windows,'' said R. Wade Johnson, a St. James architect and interior designer. ''They are almost legislating a window that is stronger than the walls.'' Based on a standardized international code already adopted by most states, the new regulations are aimed at ''providing homeowners with safer and more energy-efficient housing that will also lower homeowner insurance premiums,'' said Peter Constantakes, spokesman for the State Division of Code Enforcement and Administration. The energy segment of the code has been in effect since last summer. The remaining sections went into effect on all new permits filed after Jan. 1 this year. ''It is good that this is putting New York in the international code and standardizing the interpretation, but there has been a little overkill,'' said Robert A. Wieboldt, executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute, a trade organization based in Islandia. ''This is the largest single increase in cost for Long Island in over 50 years coming out of a code change,'' he said, adding that most storm damage on Long Island is caused by flooding, not wind, and coastal houses are already being built to provide flood protection. For all parts of the state except Long Island, the state's new wind-load requirements -- that is how much wind a building must be able to sustain -- have increased from a minimum of 75 miles an hour to 90. In Nassau and western Suffolk County, however, the requirements have increased to 110 m.p.h., and in Suffolk's East End and anywhere on the coast within one mile of the mean high water line, they have increased to 120 m.p.h. Mr. Wieboldt said the Builders Institute has asked the State Code Council to review the code's cost-effectiveness and to reduce the wind-span designation. The new code requires all new construction in the 110 and 120 m.p.h. zones to have impact-resistant glass windows that have passed a missile test. In the 120 m.p.h. zone this involves shooting a 9-pound, 8-foot-long two-by-four at the window at 50 feet per second. Those in the 110 m.p.h. zone must endure a 4 1/2-pound, 4-foot-long two-by-four shot at 40 feet per second. An alternative to these windows would be plywood shutters seven-sixteenths of an inch thick with hardware for attaching them during a storm or approved metal roll-down shutters. Steve Berg, the specialty productions manager for Minnesota-based Andersen Windows, said that high-impact windows have been required in hurricane-prone coastal communities in the South for years, but that Long Island is the first place where such windows must meet energy-efficiency requirements. This spring, Andersen introduced a new window with three layers of glass that meets the state code. The window has two laminated panes with a plasticlike material squeezed between them -- similar to a car windshield -- on the interior side. In the air space between this double pane and the single exterior pane is the energy-efficient component -- argon, a natural gas that slows the transfer of heat and cold. In addition, the exterior pane has a coating sprayed on its interior side that reflects radiant heat. The resulting window glass is 33 percent heavier than standard glass and is encased in a wood frame with a vinyl coat for strength. Currently, the windows can be made as large as 50 square feet. In comparing the cost, Mr. Berg said an average double-hung window with plain glass could cost $250. The same unit with the energy-efficient wind-resistant components could average $550. John Napolitano, a sales representative for Triangle Building Products in Medford, said Marvin Windows and Doors, another Minnesota-based supplier, has products meeting the 110 m.p.h. test and expects to have windows for the 120 m.p.h. zone by summer. Added to the cost of the new windows are requirements that include tying a building's framing, roof, walls and floors together with hurricane straps. Previously, just ''hurricane clips'' -- metal fasteners nailing the roof to the rafters -- were required. ''On the pro side you will have a stronger house in many cases,'' said Thomas Fitzsimmons, an architect in Great Neck. ''On the con side, it is a learning curve for all of us, and there is an increased cost to residential clients, because even new additions have to comply.'' REALTORS say they think the added costs may increase new house prices by 10 to 15 percent. ''The market is good now, but I am concerned that the code will drive up the cost of new homes and a countertrend could kick in, and people would then just say, 'No, thank you,' '' said Stuart Epstein, a co-owner of Devlin McNiff Real Estate in East Hampton. Coastal builders say today's houses are strongly constructed and already in compliance with regulations promulgated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and guidelines laid out by insurance companies to reduce the impact of flooding. George E. Vickers Jr., a Westhampton developer who primarily builds waterfront and other high-end houses in the Quogue and Westhampton area, said, ''For structural strength I recommend that my customers sheath the entire house in plywood, before adding Sheetrock.'' He maintains that Long Island homes are already more resistant to severe storms than the homes in other parts of the country that have suffered weather-related devastation. Compared with Florida, Mr. Vickers said, ''the level of building between there and here is like night and day.'' He added, ''Our coastal homes are stronger because they are custom built.'' Kenneth E. Larsen, who has been building houses in the Fire Island village of Saltaire for 28 years, said the new code is ''very extreme; what we had before was good.'' The average Saltaire house is about 3,000 square feet with construction costing $200 to $300 a square foot. The overall building cost will increase by 25 percent with the new windows and the tie-down system, he said. Also, there will be a problem in lifting the heavier windows, since it is difficult to take a crane to Fire Island. Todd Dobert, who is the owner of Dobert Construction in Brookhaven, and his father, Ron, build and renovate homes in Fire Island's Pines community and on the South Shore. ''Years ago in building a coastal house you put down a locust post three feet in the ground, used some tenpenny nails and put a beam on it and that was your house,'' said the senior Mr. Dobert. ''But today the houses have to be well-anchored to get the insurance you need.'' Instead of $20,000 beach cottages, people today are putting in elaborate $700,000 houses that average 2,700 to 3,200 square feet. They are similar to an average mainland house, he said. Dobert will be constructing 12 houses on 28 acres in the hamlet of Brookhaven, a half-mile from the Great South Bay. The 3,500- to 4,000-square-foot, custom-built houses on two-acre lots would be listed at an average of $850,000. Under the new code, that cost is expected to inflate at least 20 percent, ''especially since it will be more labor-intensive,'' Mr. Dobert said. Because Long Island and its barrier beaches jut east-west into the Atlantic Ocean, it is a prime target for hurricanes that travel north up the eastern seaboard. ''A major hurricane on Long Island is a rare event, but it can happen,'' said Michael Wyllie, meteorologist-in-charge for the weather service at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton. ''The return period of a Category 3 or more is 60 years, and the last one was in 1938. So, we are overdue.'' A Category 3 storm has sustained winds of 111 to 130 m.p.h. He added that the 1938 hurricane, which had sustained winds of 120 m.p.h. and gusts of 130 m.p.h., devastated much of the East End and the barrier beaches In the Region | Long Island"
"Sudden Sea The Great Hurricane of 1938. By R. A. Scotti. Illustrated. 279 pp. Boston: Little, Brown & Company. $24.95. The rains that began in May and June, only to be joined by hot, muggy stretches in the months since, could spell more than a washout of a summer. Those whose job it is to translate these weather events into forecasts at, say, the National Weather Service predict that the 2003 hurricane season will be fiercer than usual. But even amateurs can tell you that a tropical summer in New England augurs a tempestuous September. In fact, these past summer months have not been very different from those of 1938, when, on Sept. 21, a hurricane packing 186-mile-an-hour gusts slammed into southern New England. The Great Hurricane of 1938 was, as detailed in R. A. Scotti's dramatic but uneven ''Sudden Sea,'' the worst weather disaster in the history of the region and the fourth most fatal in United States history. Also called the ''Long Island Express,'' because it covered seven states in seven hours, the 1938 hurricane killed 682 people. Hardest hit was Scotti's home state, Rhode Island, where 433 died. Attacking what one forecaster described as ''the most densely populated area in the world'' at the time, the hurricane struck Long Island, then made landfall again in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Later, the storm swept through the Berkshires and northward. The gale-force winds took down tens of thousands of trees all the way to Vermont. In Montpelier, windows were covered with salt from a sea more than 100 miles away. The lethal blow, loaded with sand and debris, plucked the feathers off chickens, blasted the paint off cars and deposited an eight-ton DC-2 in a marsh a half-mile from where it had been parked. The rain that accompanied the wind had no less an effect, dumping 17 inches in five days on Connecticut and Massachusetts and flooding local rivers. In Hartford, the Connecticut rose almost 20 feet. In Norwich, the Thames River climbed seven feet in an hour. Before the waters receded, the flood line in downtown Providence reached 17 feet above street level. On the coast, the storm surge, the wall of water conjured by the hurricane's swirling winds and rising tides, wiped out whole beach communities. Giant waves, described in one instance as ''soiled gray'' and capped by a 10-foot ''crest of murky froth,'' ultimately carved a new coastline. But, according to Scotti, neither the wind nor the rain nor the storm surge did as much damage as the fact that there had been no warning broadcast. In 1938, Weather Bureau personnel were not without meteorological tools. But after the thermometer, barometer and hygrometer (to measure humidity), they relied for the most part on ''surface observations.'' Certainly New Englanders weren't expecting the storm. It was only the third major hurricane on record to strike the region. The first was the Colonial Hurricane of 1635, followed by the Great September Gale of 1815. Apparently, Scotti says, the summer of 1815 was also hot and wet. In its nascent stages, the 1938 storm was closely tracked in Florida for days. After it had veered away from the coast, forecasters in Washington deemed the storm was no longer a threat. As Scotti explains, it was thought that the colder northern seas would remove the storm's sting. The word ''hurricane'' was actually edited from an advisory. The bulletin was originally written by a less experienced tracker whose information showed that, among other factors, the northern position of the Bermuda High (a semi-permanent high-pressure cell), combined with an unusual low-pressure system, very much warranted a hurricane alert. But the big blow did not lose momentum as expected. And because most watercraft had heeded the earlier warnings, there were few eyewitnesses who could help spot the storm's speedy progress. It's hard to imagine how a hurricane so expertly tracked days before could simply disappear from view, and how it could wreak such damage -- $4.7 billion adjusting for inflation, according to Scotti -- in so little time. Scotti's attempt to provide answers results in an ambitious seven-state sprawl of information. Relying on published accounts, meteorological analysis and interviews with survivors, she has an inherently gripping story on her hands. There are the facts of the storm, which are monumentally appalling. The human face of loss is even more excruciating. In the aftermath, Scotti writes, it was necessary to count the dead along the beaches of Rhode Island by air because so many ''had put on their boots to slog through the water.'' The heavy boots ''weighed the bodies down so that only the tops of their heads were visible.'' A writer of thrillers and a memoir about her infant son's fatal illness, Scotti is well versed in the basics of drama. Tugging perhaps a little too forcefully on the heartstrings, she focuses on the helpless. Women step out back doors, never to be seen again, and children die awful (and awfully detailed) deaths. In a particularly overwrought moment, Scotti writes, ''Bodies, living and dead, piled up on the shore, battered and entangled by the wreckage of their lives.'' AT the center of her story are the devastated people of Rhode Island. In early pages we meet Lillian Tetlow and Jack Kinney, young lovers on a beach who survived the tempest; the four Matoes children, who had the misfortune of taking the bus home from school and were drowned; and Catherine Moore and her family, who sailed out to sea on the only piece of their house that remained intact, the attic floor. Recounted in vignettes, these scenes -- and others -- are spliced between moments of the gathering storm. As moving as they are meant to be, the passages are hard to follow. One's not always sure which state Scotti's talking about, or where she is in her chronology, much less which hapless bunch she's referring to (even more confusing is that two families share the same name). In a particularly forced story line, Katharine Hepburn's hurricane experience is recounted. (She was at home in Old Saybrook, Conn., when the hurricane hit. Roped together, Hepburn and her family barely escaped drowning as they watched their house wash out to sea.) Scotti should know that she doesn't have to work so hard to get across what is an intrinsically thrilling tale. Especially considering the summer we've had, a person may wonder exactly where that Bermuda High is hanging out these days. Erica Sanders is a writer and editor living in Connecticut."
"Utility companies made major strides to restore power today in parts of Maryland and Northern Virginia, but severe damage sharply slowed work in southern Virginia and North Carolina, where more than 700,000 homes and businesses remained dark for yet another day. With frustration growing over the pace of repairs, some officials questioned whether utility companies were adequately prepared for the storm. Utility officials could offer little good news for the storm-ravaged areas of Richmond and Tidewater in Virginia and eastern North Carolina, saying most people there could not expect to have power until Thursday or later. More than one million homes and businesses in the storm's path remained without power tonight. ''In many cases, we're not just making repairs, we're having to rebuild the system from ground up,'' said Neil Durbin, a spokesman for the Dominion Virginia Power Company. ''There are places where there are more poles and wires down on the ground than are standing.'' State officials said the number of deaths from Hurricane Isabel rose today to at least 34, confirming official predictions that the poststorm period might be nearly as dangerous as the storm itself. About half of those deaths have occurred since Friday, when the storm had already passed over the region. Firefighters in Prince George's County, Md., today found the body of a woman who appeared to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Officials said the owner of the house in which the woman died had been running a gasoline-powered electrical generator in his basement, allowing deadly carbon monoxide fumes to seep into an upstairs bedroom. The homeowner was hospitalized for carbon monoxide sickness. At least seven deaths in Maryland and Virginia have been the result of carbon monoxide poisoning from poorly ventilated generators, officials said. In Prince George's County alone, 18 people have been reported to have become ill from carbon monoxide since the storm struck on Thursday. Sunday was a particularly deadly day in Virginia, with five people dying from storm-related causes, officials said. Two people drowned while crossing a storm-swollen stream, one had a heart attack cutting down a tree, one died after falling down the stairs in a darkened home and one committed suicide due to depression aggravated by the power failures, said Dawn Eischen, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. In all, 23 people have died because of Hurricane Isabel in Virginia, 10 since Friday, Ms. Eischen said. The slowness of the restoration work has caused some officials to question whether the utility companies were sufficiently prepared for the hurricane. Tony Bullock, a spokesman for Mayor Anthony Williams of Washington, said an ''antiquated distribution system'' in many neighborhoods might have contributed to the widespread power failures. ''If you have bare copper wires and old ceramic insulators and frail, brittle poles, you'll suffer more impact than if you had invested some money into improving the system,'' Mayor Williams said. Some critics of deregulation have also argued that energy companies have had to cut back spending on maintenance and tree trimming to improve profits in a more competitive world. Power company officials denied that, arguing that their spending on maintaining their distribution system had remained steady. They did not deny that deregulation had made it more difficult to increase investments on their distribution systems. ''We're squeezed,'' said Robert A. Dobkin, a spokesman for Pepco Holdings Inc. ''We're investor-owned, and the obligation to the investor is to generate profits.'' But Mr. Dobkin and other power company officials argued that they were hit by a confluence of weather problems. First, a drought last year weakened many trees. Then heavy rains this year loosened their roots. Finally, strong winds toppled them. Many officials in the region said they did not blame the utility companies, and believed that the companies had done all they could under extraordinary circumstances. ''It's a huge job,'' said Bob Batcher, a spokesman for the City of Norfolk. ''Everyone feels they've done a good job. But it gets harder and harder to be complimentary as time goes by.'' President Bush today visited the Richmond area, where he flew over storm-damaged areas, met with emergency-response workers and addressed by videophone the governors of the states hit hardest by the storm, including Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Standing in a control room where colored maps showing the hurricane's path were displayed, Mr. Bush told the governors he was concerned that so many people were still without power. But he also commended the utility companies for recruiting workers from outside the region to help in the reconstruction. ''I want to thank those workers, who are manning the chain saws and getting the lines back up so people can have electricity,'' Mr. Bush said. At least three utility workers, two from outside the region, have been electrocuted while repairing power lines in Maryland and North Carolina. After returning by helicopter to Washington, Mr. Bush met in the Oval Office with the Iraqi minister of electricity, Avham Sameraei, who gave him an update on restoration of electricity in that war-torn country. Meanwhile today, residents and business owners across the region did their best to cope. They joined long lines to get gasoline or buy ice. They used barbecue grills to cook the last of their unspoiled meat. They limped through busy intersections without traffic lights. Jennifer Russell, the general manager of Stardust, a restaurant in the Old Town section of Alexandria, has been arriving at work at 9 a.m. every morning since the storm, hoping that all her power would be back. It was not this morning, meaning she expected to be closed for the fourth straight day. The restaurant has enough electricity to run its meat locker, but not its ventilation fans or its smaller coolers. Today Ms. Russell expected she would have to throw away $5,000 in produce and sauces. All told, she estimated, the restaurant had lost $30,000 during the blackout. ''The power company made us feel they would be here right away to fix things,'' she said. ''But all they did was come by with their yellow caution tape around a downed line. It's devastating.'' At a Motel 6 on Georgia Avenue in Northwest Washington, residents from the neighborhood have been checking in to escape their powerless homes. ''One lady said she can't take the humidity and came for the air-conditioning,'' said Steve Ripai, the desk manager. ''Some said they need to watch some TV. They can't take the darkness anymore.'' Dominion Virginia reported this afternoon that it had restored power to nearly 1.1 million of the 1.8 million customers who lost electricity after the storm. Only about 46,000 customers in Northern Virginia were still without electricity. But more than 600,000 customers in Richmond, Tidewater and other parts of Virginia and northern North Carolina were still without power. Pepco reported today that it had restored power to about 350,000 of the more than 500,000 customers who had lost electricity. Nearly 67,000 homes and businesses in Montgomery County, Md., and another 48,000 in Washington remained without power tonight. The region's other major utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric, said it still had 194,000 customers without power late this afternoon. The company had 720,000 customers lose power during the storm. Meanwhile, another storm moved into the Washington area tonight, causing concern that it might stop repair work. Utility officials said they were worried that the storm might also knock more trees down. Correction: October 3, 2003, Friday Because of an editing error, an article on Sept. 23 about utility lines damaged by Hurricane Isabel misattributed a comment about the maintenance faults that might have contributed to power failures in Washington. It was Tony Bullock, a spokesman for Mayor Anthony Williams -- not the mayor himself -- who said, ''If you have bare copper wires and old ceramic insulators and frail, brittle poles, you'll suffer more impact than if you had invested some money into improving the system.''"
"The East Coast girded for the worst today as Hurricane Isabel, its maximum sustained winds easing slightly to a still-powerful 120 miles per hour, churned up the Atlantic. Forecasters said that if the storm stayed on track, it would slam into the fragile Outer Banks of North Carolina in three days and grind on up Chesapeake Bay. As emergency-management officials from South Carolina to Massachusetts activated disaster plans, the Navy ordered 40 warships and submarines in Norfolk to put to sea, the Air Force ordered fighter jets at coastal bases to fly inland as far as Oklahoma and the governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency. For longtime residents of coastal communities, who know to monitor weather reports and Web sites come September, preparations for Isabel were already well under way over the weekend, a result of a new government effort to provide five-day forecasts of hurricane movements. Federal officials said their five-day hurricane forecasts were now just as reliable as a three-day forecast was 15 years ago. [Page A14.] Experts said that the most likely path would take the storm over the Outer Banks and up the Chesapeake toward Washington but that it was still possible it could strike New England. Evacuations have already been ordered in some coastal communities in Virginia and North Carolina. Here in the Outer Banks, residents were making their own decisions on whether or when to evacuate. At a Food Lion, Tonya Vermilion, 30, said that even if a mandatory evacuation was ordered, she planned to ride out the storm with her husband and two young girls, as long as Isabel did not gain strength and reach Category 4 status, with sustained winds of 131 m.p.h. to 155 m.p.h. Her husband was at home boarding up their year-old home, Ms. Vermilion said, so she ran out for diapers, formula, Pepsi, beer and whatever canned food she could still find on the supermarket's shelves. ''My first daughter was born right between Dennis and Floyd, the hurricanes in 1999,'' she said. ''The houses down here are built to withstand 130 m.p.h. winds. I wouldn't feel comfortable pushing it beyond that. ''But my husband's braver than I am. He's a mason, and he's afraid he'll miss out on the rebuilding work afterwards, that he won't be able to get back in because of the flooding. If you got a big truck and a chain saw, you're good, as long as you're there.'' Pickup trucks laden with plywood zoomed down the highways leading to the causeway across Currituck Sound, as the lanes heading west and north to safety were filled with families in S.U.V.'s, many towing boats and campers that the storm might otherwise have wrecked. As of 5 p.m., the National Hurricane Center was projecting Isabel to make landfall in the Outer Banks at about 2 p.m. on Thursday. On oft-battered Ocracoke Island, its only tether to the mainland a ferry, residents and remaining vacationers were told to pack up and leave as of 12:30 p.m. today. ''It looks like we got a magnet in our pocket,'' Don Davenport, the Hyde County manager, said glumly. ''It's heading right for us.'' Residents on the mainland in Hyde County were asked to evacuate voluntarily beginning noon on Tuesday; the order will become mandatory as of 5 a.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Davenport said. To the north, officials in Norfolk, Va., 20 miles inland, said they would announce a mandatory evacuation of parts of that city on Tuesday. They were trying to avoid gridlock should the entire population of Virginia Beach -- some 450,000 people -- be evacuated later this week. Mark Marchbank, of the Virginia Beach Fire Department, said a recently finished $85 million project to protect beachfront homes from hurricanes might be too little to withstand Isabel. The worst storms on record in Virginia Beach were in 1933 and 1936, Mr. Marchbank said, when water rose 9.6 feet above the mean low water level. ''This one looks like it could go 12 or so feet above the mean,'' he said. Mary Bingham, 38, was not waiting for orders. She packed up her dog, cat, two small daughters, a butterfly cocoon and all the photo negatives she could grab. ''The pictures are the most important thing to me,'' said Ms. Bingham, who was driving to meet her husband, already in High Point, N.C., on a business trip. The couple have been living in a rental house while their new home is built in Virginia Beach. ''Just the frame is up so far,'' she said. ''I hope it stays.'' In New York City and its suburbs, officials were also going over evacuation procedures. The Police Department designated captains and inspectors as hurricane coordinators and ordered them to identify potential evacuation routes and relocation centers, an official said. Police commanders also have been ordered to survey construction sites to make sure that equipment is properly secured in the event of a heavy storm and that adequate fuel is on hand for police vehicles and backup generators. Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged residents to ''take the precautions now and not wait until the last day.'' He said New Yorkers should stock up on batteries, flashlights, extra canned foods and water. ''Make sure you have a few days supply of baby products and medicines and things that you absolutely can't do without,'' he said. ''If the storm hits, and even if it misses us closely, we're likely to have flooding in the normal places that flood.'' Along the Jersey Shore, getting ready for Isabel so far has meant taking in the wicker from the front porch and deck chairs from out back, rolling up and tying down awnings, and discussing how often dire warnings of approaching storms have proven to be false alarms. ''You always hear how terrible it's going to be and then what? It's just some rain and wind,'' said Geraldine Martino in Ocean Grove, an old summer retreat that is now home to a large year-round population. Still, her husband Joe, a retired salesman, said he was making sure everything in his basement was off the floor. ''We've got two sump pumps,'' Mr. Martino said. ''But we're also only five blocks from the ocean.'' On Long Island, Eileen Halek of Hampton Bays said she was watching the Weather Channel continually -- ''I'm obsessed,'' Ms. Halek said -- and emptying her freezer in anticipation of a long blackout. She had already given away a London broil and a good deal of chicken to her sons. ''I'm scared,'' she said. ''I've been cleaning up my yard and putting away my planters.'' But some people, like Claire Watts of Rocky Point, are looking forward to the storm. With a gleam in her eye, Ms. Watts interrupted a stroll through Southampton yesterday and recalled the way storms churn the sky and sea. ''They're beautiful,'' she said. ''I love hurricanes, quite honestly.''"
"Families who have passed this vacation spot down through the generations expect certain landmarks: Jennette's Pier, 64 years old and stretching 600 feet into the Atlantic; the Sea Foam Motel, all teal-colored kitsch; and Crabtree Court, a cluster of 50's-era cottages hard by the beach. All are gone now, or at least grievously damaged by the 30-foot waves that pounded communities up and down the Outer Banks when Hurricane Isabel roared through on Thursday. Entire strips of beachfront are devastated, and though natives of these pinky-thin barrier islands insist things will soon return to normal -- another year, another storm, they say -- they also admit that this hurricane altered their landscape far more than any other storm in decades. What it means for the economy of the Outer Banks, so dependent on the tourist trade, and for its culture, so proudly defiant of the elements that regularly batter it, depends on whom you ask. ''A bit of a cleansing'' is how Carolyn McCormick, director of the Outer Banks Visitors Bureau, described the storm's impact with a fierce smile. Her business is persuading people to visit, and so her take on the hundreds of millions of dollars in property and beach damage is that Hurricane Isabel uncovered more of the natural resources that visitors flock here to see. New dunes have been formed, Ms. McCormick said, and a previously submerged shipwreck is now off Coquina Beach. ''It is even more magical now,'' Ms. McCormick said as she prepared to assess commercial damage in a meeting with business owners. ''We will come back stronger than we've ever been.'' Stronger, maybe, but also less appealing, other residents say. With institutions like the Sea Foam and Jennette's Pier in ruins, chances are good that developers will snap up the properties and build big, flashy houses and hotels, chipping away at the old-time, mom-and-pop feel of Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and other oceanfront towns that suffered a lot of damage. The Outer Banks, so geographically isolated that they were long untouched by development, has seen a lot of it over the last decade, as people from Virginia on up the Atlantic coast discovered they could buy land here for significantly less than land closer to home. The damage wrought by Hurricane Isabel will only speed the transformation from old-fashioned and out-of-the-way to modern and crowded, some say. Permit agencies will forbid the rebuilding of old structures on grounds that they are dangerous, they say, making way for flashy new development. ''All these places are going to collect on insurance and they're going to sell the land,'' said Shane Johnson, 26, a plumber who was gazing at the remains of Jennette's Pier, where he used to surf. ''You'll see a bunch of houses with 10 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms go up, and you'll see this place lose a little more of its soul.'' In the continental United States, only Florida has a more vulnerable stretch of coastline than the Outer Banks, a chain of islands that extend 137 miles from just south of the Chesapeake Bay to the South Carolina border. Wind and wild weather are constants here, and residents accept sand piled like snowdrifts on the roadways and house beams tossed out to sea. They point to the Wright Brothers, who took their first flight from Kitty Hawk, just north of Nags Head, as the models for their own pluck. ''How in heck can someone live in San Francisco with earthquakes or New York with terrorism and tell me I live in a dangerous place?'' said Mike Kelly, who owns four restaurants here and said he has lost about $200,000 in business since this hurricane. Mr. Kelly said Outer Banks residents learned from each storm, passing new zoning and building ordinances and constructing stronger homes. But will the tourists and developers keep coming now that Hurricane Isabel has reminded them how vulnerable the Outer Banks are? There has not, after all, been a storm this brutal since at least 1962, or possibly 1933, old-timers say. While today's wreckage could bring more resilient buildings to the Banks, it could also keep such development at bay, a possibility that appeals to some. Mr. Johnson said Nags Head was not the tranquil place he moved to eight years ago. Instead, it teems with contractors and real estate types always looking for the latest project or land deal. A Home Depot opened last year, he said, and for the first time, a chain restaurant, Outback Steakhouse. ''When something like this happens it makes people think twice about their investments,'' Mr. Johnson said, staring at the remains of Jennette's Pier. ''Storms strip you down to what's real -- what's important and what's not.'' An Outer Banks spot that has resisted development more than most is Hatteras Village, 50 miles south of Nags Head at the tip of the Hatteras National Seashore. It is even more isolated now: the hurricane carved a new inlet through the island, cutting the village off from the highway north for the indefinite future. The damage was worst here, with at least a dozen houses and several hotels destroyed. Tim Midgett, a developer whose family has been in Hatteras ''as far back as we can trace,'' said the hurricane would not stop ''demand for the product.'' His family was in the process of selling one of its hotels when the storm hit, and though the hotel was seriously damaged, he said, the buyer is still interested. ''We've had major catastrophes before,'' Mr. Midgett said, ''but every time we emerge better.'' But in the most ravaged part of Hatteras, where hotels, shops and homes look as though they were stomped on or blown up and the air smelled of decay, not everyone was so resolute. Jody Stowe, who was born there and saw her jewelry shop, her home and her mother's home reduced to soggy, stinky rubble, told Mr. Midgett something new to his ears when he greeted her today. . ''I don't know if I'm going to stay here,'' Ms. Stowe murmured, suggesting that like the coastline itself, the people who know it best can in fact be broken by a storm. -------------------- 835,000 Still Lack Power By The New York Times WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 -- From North Carolina to Pennsylvania more than 835,000 homes and businesses were still without power today, down from a peak of more than 4 million, according to the major power companies. The biggest problems were in Virginia, where 211,000 customers were without power in the Richmond area and 259,000 more were dark in the Tidewater area, according to the Dominion Virginia Power Company. In Washington, 36,000 were still without power; in Maryland, the figure was 214,000, including 30,000 in Baltimore and 59,000 in Montgomery County."
"The word ''power'' took on a new meaning in the nation's capital today, as hundreds of thousands of residents awoke to the prospect of days, and possibly a week, without it. In the aftermath of Hurricane Isabel, federal and local governments remained shut down, as did schools and many businesses. The storm felled countless trees and power lines; more than 800,000 customers in Washington and its suburbs in Maryland and Virginia lacked electricity this afternoon. The authorities said they did not expect the power to be fully restored for at least a week. ''This will be a marathon, not a sprint,'' said Jimmy D. Staton, senior vice president of operations at Dominion Virginia Power. ''Isabel was the worst storm in our company's history.'' Today, a city that thrives on news and newsmakers found itself devoid of both. With the president at Camp David and most members of Congress having fled town before the storm, the official business of Washington ground to a halt, and most people simply stayed home. The Washington Post, The New York Times and USA Today, all of which have printing plants in Fairfax County, Va., had difficulty publishing, and many residents found themselves without their morning newspapers, not to mention the power required to watch television news. The subway system, which had shut down on Thursday at 11 a.m., reopened but was virtually empty. Though the trains were running, some stations lacked power, forcing passengers to move in darkness until they reached the platforms, which had emergency lights. In Bethesda, Md., transit police used flashlights to guide people to their trains. At the National Arboretum in Washington, Scott Aker, a horticulturist, was heartbroken over the state of the prized azalea collection, which draws thousands of visitors each spring. Many of the plants were crushed when fierce winds toppled about a dozen oaks, including one more than a century old. Though employees had the day off, many came in today to help clean up. ''It looks like a bomb went off,'' Mr. Aker said. In Alexandria, Va., the roiling waters of the Potomac spilled over into the streets on Thursday night, flooding stores and homes in the historic Old Town district. Gary Crowe, the owner of Custom Framing, looked grim as he surveyed the damage. His rugs were soaked through, and by this afternoon he had torn them up. Before the storm, he had piled his business records and customers' artwork on top of a counter. But he could not remove his equipment from the floor, and most of it was destroyed. ''I expected it to be the worst ever, but it was a notch above that,'' Mr. Crowe said. ''It'll take a week before I'm up and running again.'' Throughout the region, people like Mr. Crowe spent the day cleaning up and pulling together. In Fort Washington, Md., Jose Abbey awoke to five fallen trees and a basement, which had just been refurbished, full of water. A neighbor with a generator offered to help him hook up a sump pump, and other neighbors pitched in to help clear Mr. Abbey's trees. He estimated the damage at $40,000. ''Just sheer devastation,'' he said. ''I was traumatized.'' In the Capitol Hill neighborhood, scattered trees were down, blocking major intersections. The Capitol itself was nearly empty. But the local Starbucks was packed with neighborhood residents enjoying the day off. Some took the occasion to hold block parties. On a cul-de-sac in Chevy Chase, Md., Cathy Grubman, a cable television producer, and her neighbors planned an evening barbecue. ''We just said, 'Since all the meat in the freezer is already thawed, we may as well cook it up,' '' Ms. Grubman said. ''One guy had the grill, another guy had some leftover coals.'' Nearby, in Bethesda, Md., the lines were 40 feet long at Strosnider's Hardware, which opened for business this morning using five backup generators. Rakes, leaf bags and lamp oils were in big demand, but the store ran out of batteries; by noon, the store's manager, Jim Beckett, said a truck was on the way to restock the shelves. Generators were in short supply. A woman planning a weekend party asked Mr. Beckett if she could borrow one in the event the store's power returned. ''I said, 'No ma'am,' '' he reported. ''That generator stays here.'' AFTER THE STORM: THE CAPITAL"
"Outside, winds from Tropical Storm Isabel were whipping down the boardwalk on Thursday night, but inside Boardwalk Hall, Vikki Earp, the mother of Miss North Carolina, was thinking little of the weather. This was about winning. ''We know we have damage at our beach home,'' Ms. Earp said, as her daughter Dana Reason competed in a preliminary Miss America event inside the hall. ''We've got insurance,'' she added with a laugh. She turned back to watch Miss Kansas twirl a baton to ''Overture and a Prisoner of the Crusades.'' Pageant organizers did not have the option of blocking out the storm, or the headache over what it could have been. Many were in a near panic on Thursday night as Isabel rolled by well to the west. They talked of canceling tonight's boardwalk parade -- made up of nearly 100 floats, various drill teams and all 51 contestants riding in open convertibles -- and possibly even moving Saturday's main event, the crowning of Miss America 2004. They prayed, they gestured, they stared at the sky. George Bauer, president and chief executive of the Miss America Organization, appeared at a news conference this morning looking exhausted, but relieved, after patrolling the boardwalk most of the night looking for damage. ''I was out on the beach at 2 a.m. myself,'' he said. He smiled. ''We've been blessed.'' The crew primping Miss Virginia, Nancy Redd, of Martinsville, never had a chance to capitalize on what they said was a secret weapon: her natural hairstyle. If winds and rain had accompanied the parade, her hair would have remained unfazed and unfrizzed, they said, unlike the other, more structured hairstyles held in place by sprays and gels. Sitting in Boardwalk Hall on Thursday was Ms. Redd's boyfriend and her coach, Jane Leizer. One person who had not yet arrived was Ms. Leizer's husband. But as she followed each note of Ms. Redd's piano recital, Ms. Leizer said her husband would just have to fend for himself, wherever he was. ''My husband was supposed to be on a train at 4 a.m. today,'' she said. ''I haven't heard from him.'' He finally made it to Atlantic City, by car, after a two-day journey. Ms. Redd said today that the contestants had been restricted from communicating with the outside world -- one of the many rules that govern every waking moment during the contest -- keeping her and the other 50 contestants in the dark about friends back home. ''We have no cellphone,'' Ms. Redd said. She echoed Ms. Earp's remarks that preparing for the pageant had been enough drama without worrying about some meteorological disaster. ''It's been a whirlwind,'' Ms. Redd said. ''I think the calmest people in here during this hurricane have been the contestants.'' Evelyn Ay Sempier, Miss America 1954, said she remembered being at the pageant 49 years ago, when everyone wasn't so lucky. As Hurricane Carol rolled through New Jersey, the pageant was forced to move to higher ground in the city. ''It was a mess, a break-down-the-Boardwalk kind of hurricane,'' she said. ''But you know, the pageant goes on either way.''"
"For all the apocalyptic forecasting, Hurricane Isabel moved through the New York region with more of a whimper than a bang. High winds pushed over trees and pulled down power lines, but the fears of extensive flooding that prompted officials to declare emergencies and muster rescue vehicles for low-lying areas proved groundless. One death was reported, of a Pennsylvania woman whose car was struck by a falling tree in Warren County, N.J., before dawn this morning, the state police said. Another falling tree seriously injured Christopher Bright of Edgemere, Queens, when it struck his car as he was driving yesterday in Nassau County. The death of an off-duty police officer who apparently drowned surfing in 15-foot storm-driven waves off Long Beach, Long Island, on Thursday is not yet being tied to the hurricane. For the rest of the region, Isabel, which was downgraded to a tropical storm, brought a night of rattling windows and scattered blackouts, and was followed by a sunny and warm day with lingering strong gusts of wind as the storm passed to the west of the region. By midday, it had broken into a disorganized line of strong winds and rain over the Great Lakes. But anxious school administrators, warned of flooding and falling trees, made today a warm late-summer day off for many schoolchildren. For some parents, having the children at home led to a scramble for baby sitters or for days off for themselves. Others saw the unexpected long weekend as a welcome bonus after a week of increasingly feverish news coverage of the approaching storm. ''It's great,'' said Ann Ruocco of Riverdale, N.Y. Two of her children had classes canceled today. ''They have all the benefits of the day off with the added benefit of beautiful weather,'' she said. Todd Miner, a meteorologist with the Weather Communications Group at Pennsylvania State University, said today that for all the worries about rain, few areas of the region got more than an inch. The strongest winds, he said, were clocked at La Guardia Airport during the night at 51 miles per hour. ''Things were not all that interesting after all,'' Mr. Miner said. Bradley Campbell, the environmental protection commissioner of New Jersey, said in an interview today that the heavy wave and wind action eroded some beaches in the state, particularly in Sea Bright, Monmouth Beach and Long Branch. ''I would characterize the damage as widespread but moderate,'' Mr. Campbell said. Blackouts were a problem in the suburbs of New York City, particularly on Long Island, and in upstate communities around Binghamton, which were in the path of the weakening storm. The Long Island Power Authority said today that just over 51,000 customers lost power overnight, but that all but 5,000 of them had power restored by late today. Gov. George E. Pataki announced that, with New York escaping the worst of the storm, the New York Power Authority would send tree-clearing and electric-line repair crews to Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina, where widespread power failures and downed power lines continued to be a problem. ''In times of crisis, New Yorkers have been the beneficiaries of an outpouring of support from people across America,'' the governor said at a news conference on Long Island. ''Now, we have an opportunity to reciprocate by sending our expert electric repair crews south.'' Here in South Jersey, the storm as a topic of conversation faded with the rain, and attention went back to squeezing a few more days of beach time from the summer. In Atlantic City, the Boardwalk parade of Miss America contestants went ahead as scheduled, and the city was crowded with visitors, many from the South, who had come for the pageant and to root for hometown contestants. ''This was my third hurricane,'' said Mitci McDaniel, who came up from Jasper, Ala., for the pageant, ''and we've got bigger tornadoes than this at home.'' County officials are now counting the cost in overtime for the police and rescue personnel who were deployed overnight to wait out the storm. One of them was Tom Adams, a Longport, N.J., patrolman, who was sitting in his cruiser at a roadblock, put up at the southern end of the barrier island to keep the sightseers away. ''This is nothing,'' he said as the heavy winds made the streetlights dance. ''I've been here when these streets were underwater.''"
"Hurricane Isabel petered out over Canada last night, leaving a wide scar of destruction: nearly two dozen deaths, flooded cities in Virginia and Maryland, millions of people without power and tens of thousands of fallen trees that punctured roofs and blocked roads from North Carolina to New Jersey. As people on North Carolina's Outer Banks began cleaning up, residents of Baltimore were forced to flee the rising waters of a storm-swollen Chesapeake Bay. The waters reached six feet in places before receding yesterday afternoon, leaving neighborhoods looking like Venice as people used rafts and kayaks to maneuver the narrow streets. Waters from the Potomac River coursed into the streets of Alexandria, Va., flooding stores and homes in the historic Old Town district. Forecasters said heavy rains in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley yesterday morning would probably create flooding in parts of central and northern Virginia as well as in northern Maryland today as rivers crest. ''I hesitate to say the worst is over,'' said Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''That's when most deaths occur, after the storm is gone.'' At least 23 deaths were attributed to the storm, including 14 in Virginia. Most were the result of traffic accidents during high winds and rain, or from trees toppling onto cars or houses. Two people in Virginia died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a poorly ventilated generator. At the request of Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., President Bush declared Maryland a disaster area, making residents in Baltimore and more than two dozen counties eligible for federal assistance. Mr. Bush had already designated North Carolina and Virginia disaster areas. Much of the region remained dark last night as more than 10,000 electrical workers scrambled to remove trees that had knocked down power lines. Officials said more than 3 million homes and businesses still had no electricity, including 1.5 million in Virginia, 353,000 in North Carolina and 1.1 million in Maryland. Power company officials warned that it could take a week or longer to restore power in some places. Though government officials said it was too early to estimate the damage, an industry group projected $1 billion in property losses covered by private insurance. By comparison, Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused more than $2 billion in insured losses, said the Insurance Information Institute, a nonprofit group financed by the industry. The estimate does not include damage from flooding, which is covered by federal flood insurance. Though winds reached 100 m.p.h. over North Carolina on Thursday, Hurricane Floyd covered a bigger area and moved much slower, lingering long enough to leave heavier rains and cause worse flooding, experts said. ''We're lucky Isabel moved as quickly as she did,'' said Michael A. Sager, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pa. ''It means we got less rain.'' Eleven inches of rain fell on the central Shenandoah Valley in western Virginia, and four to six inches soaked eastern North Carolina and southern Virginia, the National Weather Service said. The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday night. Churning winds also caused a tidal surge of 11.3 feet in the Potomac River near Washington, eclipsing a record set in 1933 by more than two inches, the weather service said. The nation's capital was quiet today, with the federal government shut down for the second day. Many major intersections were blocked by downed trees and much of the city was without power. By the time the storm reached Pennsylvania and West Virginia on Thursday night, it had weakened so much that only one to three inches of rain fell. But tens of thousands of people lost power in the two states, and there were reports of flash floods in West Virginia. In the hardest-hit areas of North Carolina and Virginia, clear skies and 80-degree weather made it easy today to forget the howling winds and horizontal rain of Thursday, until one surveyed the damage. In North Carolina's historic Edenton, picture-perfect Victorian houses had been smashed by falling trees. Scores of roads remained blocked by trees. A new inlet was carved in Cape Hatteras, and the remains of a house floated in Pamlico Sound. Damage was severe enough that officials maintained curfews in Norfolk, Va., as well as Manteo, N.C., and other towns on the Outer Banks. Many roads on Cape Hatteras remained impassable, and the police told people leaving Roanoke Island for the mainland that they could not return. In Pamlico County on the central North Carolina coast, officials opened an extra shelter today in the expectation that many returning evacuees would find their homes uninhabitable. ''I have a feeling some of them will get to their homes and when they see the flooding, they will end up coming back,'' said David Spruill, Pamlico County's emergency manager. Along Virginia Beach's boardwalk, high winds tore holes in several hotels, ripped 30 feet off the 15th Street fishing pier and pushed sand over a five-foot-high flood wall. But many residents said the damage was less severe than they had expected. ''I'm elated,'' said Betty Lachman, co-owner of Ocean Eddie's Seafood Restaurant on the pier, which sustained minimal damage. ''We plan to open tomorrow.'' Several blocks away in the upscale Bay Colony area, where scores of towering pine and oak trees toppled, Carolyn Kelsey raked up limbs from a splintered tree that had just missed her daughter's bedroom. As she worked, an electrical worker stopped by to give her a grim assessment of the area's lack of power. ''It's not pretty,'' he said. ''Our crews won't get here today, and we won't get here tomorrow. What can you expect when we've got 1,500 sites to fix?'' In Chesapeake, a Virginia city on the North Carolina border, residents used chain saws to clear rural roads clogged with dozens of fallen pecan, cedar and gum trees. ''We've lived in this area for 40 years, and this is the worst storm we've seen,'' said Nettie Grandy, 59. Experts said Baltimore was hit by a dual punch. At the same time the storm's winds were pushing water in the Chesapeake Bay northward, inland rivers that had been swollen by heavy rains earlier this week were pushing water south into the bay. The rising waters met in Baltimore. The result was flooding in the city's Fell's Point, Inner Harbor and Canton districts, as well as in the eastern part of Baltimore County and in Annapolis. ''I've been here since 1985 and seen Hurricane Hugo, Gloria and Andrew,'' said Doug Woods, whose bar, the Admiral's Cup, was flooded with six feet of water. ''Those were class three, four hurricanes and the water was never as high as this tropical storm.'' The Baltimore Museum of Industry, next to the harbor, had its pier washed away and a basement archive room flooded with six feet of water. The museum's collection of National Bohemian Beer artifacts and antique printing presses was under water. Elsewhere, cars were submerged, destroying their engines and interiors. Basements of businesses and homes were flooded, ruining antique pool tables, electronic equipment and sushi-grade tuna. But the waters also brought out the community. Neighborhood bars opened in the morning and crowds toasted the watery spectacle until the health department shut them down for operating without electricity. AFTER THE STORM: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 23, 2003, Tuesday A map on Saturday showing the path of Hurricane Isabel misstated the time its center was over northern North Carolina. It was on Thursday at 5 p.m., not 5 a.m."
"Emergency officials and residents of the New York metropolitan region breathed a little easier yesterday as Hurricane Isabel held to her westerly course for the Carolinas, although the state police opened their emergency control center for New Jersey, whose southern shore is expecting heavy wind and waves tonight and tomorrow. ''Looks like we missed this one and the most we are going to get is rain and wind,'' said Diane Amarosa, executive director of the Suffolk County Red Cross. Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at the Penn State forecasting center, said Isabel's path made it doubtful that it would make landfall in New Jersey or New York. ''There's still a possibility that it could just clip the Outer Banks and head toward, at most, the mouth of the Chesapeake,'' Mr. Gadomski said. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would probably experience fitful rain and fluky winds from tonight onward, he said. A clue to growing confidence that the region will be spared the worst of the hurricane may be seen in the absence of school closing notices for districts in the far southern part of New Jersey. West Cape May schools will send children home after a half day at 12:45 this afternoon. That way they get credit for a full day under state attendance law and the district with decide later on tomorrow's schedule, said Bill Donato, the chief school administrator for the district. ''They're talking about this thing coming in about 1 to 2 p.m., so we decided to get them back to the safety of their own homes,'' he said. Concern about high river levels and debris from the runoff from the heavy rains forecast for tonight and tomorrow, however, prompted the superintendent of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area to close all access ramps to the river tomorrow. Joe Bastardi, a hurricane forecaster for AccuWeather Inc., said New York City could expect winds gusting 40 to 50 miles an hour and more than a half inch of rain by tomorrow. South Jersey will probably see more severe weather, with winds at 55 to 60 m.p.h. and rain. Still, Isabel is unusual, meteorologists say, because it is set to head inland after striking the coast, rather than veering north up the coast like a northeaster and then heading out to sea. ''It's because the river of air in which it is becoming embedded is flowing east to west,'' Mr. Gadomski of Penn State said, ''rather than west to east as it usually does.'' The last time the Atlantic Coast had a storm fitting this pattern, he said, was in 1955, when Hurricane Connie rolled through Norfolk, Va. Then as now, Mr. Bastardi of AccuWeather said, even inland communities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania can expect some local flooding. These concerns seemed far from the minds of residents who were out doing the obvious storm-proofing tasks on yet another warm and luminous day. ''As long as you remove the loose items, you will be fine,'' said Michael Drake, a resident of Captree Island on the South Shore of Suffolk County. ''This storm should not cause that many problems for us here.'' Crews from the Long Island Power Authority were deployed around Nassau and Suffolk Counties yesterday securing utility poles and cutting tree limbs away from power lines. The utility said some blackouts were likely during the storm. ''The combination of the winds and soaking rains has an effect on trees that causes power lines to fall,'' said Bill Cunningham, a spokesman for the utility. ''But these wind gusts are not tropical storm level.'' Correction: September 19, 2003, Friday An article yesterday about forecasts that the New York region would be spared the worst of Hurricane Isabel misstated the given name of the spokesman who discussed preparations by the Long Island Power Authority. He is Bert Cunningham, not Bill."
"As Hurricane Isabel nears North Carolina, where it is expected to veer toward Pennsylvania, there is mystery in its winds. For many of the people bracing for the effects of the storm along a broad swath of the East Coast, a hurricane is a rare event, and even the ones that arrive generally strike only a glancing blow. But in the Caribbean, where a storm's potential for death, destruction and ruin is too well known, residents are on the equivalent of a constant red alert virtually every day of the Atlantic hurricane season. There, from June through November, a churning anxiety accompanies the news of each weather system that is spawned, usually in waters off the west coast of Africa, and sets its sights on the Caribbean Sea. The heightened awareness is threaded through the rhythms of the region. On any given island, residents know if there is high ground and how to get there, which waterways will dangerously swell, that a storm surge is deadly and that a storm's aftermath is deadlier still. They know to batten down their homes and seek cover, but they also know that there's only so much they can do, that nature always has the upper hand. Some Americans know the storms firsthand only if they have been unlucky in booking Caribbean vacations during hurricane season. Cruises, airfares, hotels and resorts are often a bargain at this time of year, especially for travelers who either accept risk or fail to understand it. And there are many such Americans, as I learned when I served from 1998 to 2001 as United States ambassador to Belize, which is situated where the Caribbean Sea meets Central America. Killer hurricanes become lore in the United States, centering around the big ones: Camille, Andrew and the deadliest, in Galveston, in 1900. In the Caribbean, that kind of storm is a more regular visitor, destroying cities, tourist attractions and other industry, like banana plantations, sugar cane fields and fisheries. Decades ago, when Belize was a colony known as British Honduras, and before storms were named, Belize City was inundated by waters that surged over the coral reef offshore. Among the thousands killed was an American vice consul who was swept from the consulate. That building, vulnerably situated at sea level on Belize's coast, is now the United States Embassy. After another hurricane strike in the 1960's, the Belizeans moved their capital 60 miles west, to Belmopan and safety. But the American embassy didn't follow. Trying to explain this precarious situation to the State Department, I said that in the path of a powerful hurricane, the embassy would be a sitting duck, except that ducks float. When a catastrophic hurricane approaches the coastal United States, there is typically ample warning and a variety of escape routes. In Belize on the mainland, there is just one two-lane road, prone to floods, heading west to the mountains. Few besides tourists have the resources to get completely out of harm's way. During three storm seasons, I monitored many systems that sputtered into nothing. Inevitably, though, one would whip itself up, from tropical depression to tropical storm to hurricane, while rolling west across the Atlantic, becoming the first in a volley of gargantuan bowling balls coming down an alley, with the lush Caribbean islands as the unmovable pins. One such storm in 1998 was Mitch, which -- like Isabel earlier this week -- was a Category 5 hurricane, with winds exceeding 155 miles per hour. It aimed for Belize, prompting an evacuation of American civilians and some embassy staff. But on its approach, Mitch turned sharply south and weakened to a tropical storm. That might have been good news, but it hovered for days, unleashing torrential rains and mudslides that killed 11,000 people, most of them in Nicaragua and Honduras. Late in September 2000, Hurricane Keith formed in waters south of Belize, and 12 hours after reaching hurricane velocity, it puffed up to Category 4. It hit hardest at Belize's main tourist island, Ambergris Caye, then backed up and pounded it again. Homes and businesses were splintered, and water stranded whole villages. In ferrying U.S. aid to devastated areas, I saw no self-pity among the people, most of whom had no insurance to cover what they had lost. They immediately set about rebuilding, so efficiently that there are few clues now to how much destruction Keith caused. For Belizeans, this was not a ruined vacation. It was their life. Editorial Observer"
"Hurricane Isabel began jabbing the North Carolina coast today, emptying out low-lying areas up to 40 miles inland in expectation of the approaching storm's torrential rains, fierce winds and tidal flooding. Yet by tonight, as rain and wind began buffetting the coast, hundreds of residents stayed behind on the Outer Banks, dining and drinking in a few restaurants, braving the winds along sand dunes, posing for pictures on rickety piers and generally tempting fate. ''Izzy Who?'' someone had spray-painted on plywood covering a store along Highway 12, the beach road that people here fully expect to become an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday. By late tonight winds along the coast reached the force of tropical storms, exceeding 39 miles an hour. The storm is also expected to deliver drenching rains and winds of 60 miles an hour or more to major urban areas far from its center, including Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center said that the hurricane's forward speed had nearly doubled, to 13 m.p.h., this evening and would continue to accelerate as it neared land. They predicted that the storm would strike North Carolina with sustained maximum winds of 105 miles an hour, huge waves, rainfall of 10 inches or more and a tidal surge 7 to 11 feet above normal by late morning or early afternoon on Thursday between Cape Hatteras and Morehead City. Because of the wind's direction, the worst of the storm was expected to be felt northeast of its eye, placing the Outer Banks and mainland areas bordering Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds in greatest danger, experts said. By tonight, more than 150,000 people along the coast had evacuated inland, officials said. Mark Van Sciver, a spokesman for the North Carolina state emergency center, said late last night that mandatory evacuations had been ordered in part or all of 11 counties and that 84 shelters had opened in 28 counties. Low-lying areas of Washington County, along the Albemarle, were reporting some flooding. But for many residents here, hunkering down made sense -- and made for a little excitement. ''Where we going to go?'' asked Eddie Boykin of Powell's Point, who went to the 708-foot pier here to see the surf, a hurricane ritual for him and his wife, Donna. ''I got everything here,'' Mr. Boykin said. ''I got to protect what's mine. If it gets blowed away, I guess I get blowed away too. At least we'll have a beautiful ride.'' In Elizabeth City, 40 miles from the Outer Banks, 12 people were waiting when the Red Cross opened a shelter for 600 people at the state university this afternoon. Phil Park, 77, brought his bag of medicines and a box of chicken from Hardee's. ''I got a mobile home,'' he said. ''I passed by here a couple times and figured it was the thing to do.'' The hurricane should also cause canceled flights. Airports may close because of crosswinds, wet runways and flying debris. Some control towers are forced to close in high winds. At Dulles International outside Washington, ''at 55 miles per hour, they'll abandon the tower,'' said Jeff McAndrews, a spokesman for United Airlines, which has a hub there. William A. Shumann, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the towers at Reagan National and at Philadelphia and Norfolk, Va., might close because they were vulnerable to flooding. In Virginia, Gov. Mark Warner authorized mandatory evacuations in flood-prone Tidewater areas. Mr. Warner predicted that the storm's effects would be felt for days and urged residents to prepare for prolonged power failures. ''This is going to cause some frightening incidences,'' he said at a news conference. ''It's going to cause some inconveniences.'' Following his order, officials in Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Hampton, Chesapeake and other places near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay ordered more than 70,000 people to move to higher ground and opened shelters in schools. The officials urged people to depart quickly because bridges and tunnels that provide escape routes will be closed when winds exceed 59 miles an hour, possibly by midday Thursday. Early this afternoon, many roads leading to the river crossings were jammed. Mr. Warner and local officials warned that residents would probably be better off finding shelter closer to home, rather than fleeing inland, where they might move directly into the storm's path. ''The traditional evacuation routes take you to Richmond,'' Bob Batcher, a spokesman for Norfolk, said. ''But that's where the storm's heading.'' Craig Blessing followed the governor's advice. Mr. Blessing, 50, a plumbing contractor, planned to close his house three blocks from the ocean in Virginia Beach and drive 25 miles to a relative's house in Chesapeake. There, he still may face power failures and falling trees, but flooding is less likely. ''It's a choice of two evils,'' he said. ''I'll take the falling trees.'' In Norfolk, workers moved animals from the zoo to stormproof buildings. Hotels and businesses stocked bottled water and laid sandbags in lobbies. On the Virginia Beach Boardwalk, businesses seemed to take the storm threat seriously, boarding up windows and piling merchandise on high shelves. After it passes northeastern North Carolina, the hurricane's center is projected to veer toward Richmond and cut north through central Virginia, western Maryland, eastern West Virginia and into Pennsylvania. In Washington, officials said they might shut the subway and bus systems because of concerns that winds would blow riders onto tracks or in front of buses. The House of Representatives ended its business for the week today, with lawmakers saying they wanted to catch flights home. The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, called off votes for the rest of the week. Forecasters said a combination of factors could still make Isabel, now a Category 2 hurricane, more dangerous than storms of similar strength. Heavy summer rains have swollen rivers and streams that empty into Chesapeake Bay. The hurricane will probably push water northward in the bay, flushing it into the rivers and causing flooding inland, they said. Many tree roots have been loosened by the heavy rains, making them easy prey to strong winds, the forecasters said. Utilities across the region have recruited workers from other states in preparation for widespread power failures. At Outer Banks Hospital in Nags Head, officials said they decided to keep the emergency room open when the hurricane was downgraded to Category 2 on Tuesday. Twenty-four staff members are to remain through the storm, behind hurricane-resistant storm shutters. Along the beach in Kill Devil Hills tonight, Rebecca Maberry said she had stayed to avoid evacuating to the wrong place and getting stuck in the storm. She also worried about leaving her animals. ''How are we going to walk the dogs tomorrow?'' she asked a friend, Sean Kelly. ''We'll just float them out the top window,'' he said."
"For a dozen days, Hurricane Isabel has seemingly rolled on tracks laid out by government weather forecasters. Its neatly predicted ride toward a collision with the mid-Atlantic coast today reflected enormous advances in computer modeling of the atmosphere's vagaries and growing understanding of the forces that steer such giant storms. Forecasters say a five-day tracking forecast now has the same reliability as a three-day forecast 15 years ago. But forecasters have been far less successful in predicting the strength of hurricanes, a characteristic almost as important as the storms' routes in determining their destructive potential. ''We've listed that as our No. 1 priority for the research community as an area where we need help,'' said Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center. Better prediction of intensity is important, he said, because an increase in winds of just 20 or 30 miles per hour can vastly increase the scale of damage and threat to life. And a drop in the barometric pressure at the heart of a storm can greatly broaden the geographic spread of those winds as it makes landfall. The challenges were evident yesterday. An advisory issued for the hurricane by the National Hurricane Center could say only that ''the intensity forecast remains very problematic.'' An audacious research effort, though, has begun to plumb hurricanes for clues that could improve intensity forecasts. The storm and its Atlantic Ocean predecessor, Hurricane Fabian, are the first test subjects. The five-year project, by a team of several dozen government and academic researchers, has sent two specially equipped airplanes, augmenting the aircraft that routinely track all hurricanes, skimming just above the cresting waves in clear areas between the storms' spiraling canyons of thunderclouds. The research is risky but it is the only way to gather needed data, scientists say. One hazard is the rapid buildup of salt on the airplanes from lofted sea spray, which made the low-level flights ''like flying through sandpaper,'' said Michael L. Black, a meteorologist who flew into the hurricane last weekend. The intensity of the hurricane has proved unpredictable for days. On Sunday, when it had winds of 155 m.p.h., nearly as powerful as a hurricane can get, federal forecasters said that ''only minor fluctuations in intensity are expected for the next couple of days.'' But by Tuesday, its winds had dropped by 50 m.p.h. Warm water still could energize the storm, which had 105 m.p.h. winds last night, but dry air and other atmospheric conditions could sap its strength. And no supercomputer could calculate the result, leaving residents ashore with a disquieting unease. Since early September, scientists have been flying into the two hurricanes, recording air and sea conditions in repeated passes as low as 200 feet above the ocean and also dropping dozens of instrument-laden probes into the storm and into the sea in its path. The most recent flight into the current storm was on Sunday, and one more is planned as it comes ashore today, said Dr. Peter G. Black, the chief scientist leading the project for the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some of the collected data were transmitted within minutes from the planes to government climate-analysis centers to be plugged into computer models. Much more information will be assessed for months to come to refine the murky picture of how interactions between a hurricane and the surrounding air and sea can cause it to rev within a day or less into a Florida-size bulldozer or fall apart like a moth-eaten sweater. Even in the best computer models now, Dr. Black said, some of those interactions are estimated based on data gleaned from small storms with winds of 20 or 30 m.p.h. ''We know that's crazy but haven't had a better way to do it until now,'' he said. ''With Isabel and Fabian, scientists can sink their teeth into this now.'' Perhaps the biggest gap in understanding, experts say, concerns the interface between a hurricane and the ocean waters beneath. The warmth in tropical waters fuels a storm as energy is transferred from ocean to air through evaporation. But once a hurricane has formed, friction between the air and water can weaken it. In a storm with winds far beyond the speed of fast-lane highway traffic, the wind rips at the ocean so violently that it becomes impossible to neatly define which is which, said Dr. Kerry A. Emanuel, who is involved in the new research project and is a longtime researcher of hurricane behavior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''You go from bubble-filled water to spray-filled air,'' Dr. Emanuel said. ''You can't point your finger and say 'there is the surface of the ocean.' '' Designers of computer models simulating hurricanes readily acknowledged that they could not yet replicate that blinding brew of conditions. Another limit on intensity predictions is the lack of data on temperatures beneath the surface of waters ahead of an approaching hurricane. A churning hurricane can pull cold water to the surface, rapidly stifling its own growth by turning off the flow of energy from warm-water evaporation, experts say. Satellites constantly monitor the sea's surface temperatures but cannot determine temperatures of deeper layers. The team that flew into the hurricane focused on both of these data gaps. The low-level flights recorded variations in moisture, temperature and winds from near the surface upward into the storms, a region never before methodically studied. The researchers also seeded the waters ahead of Hurricane Fabian with buoys and submerged sensors that provided profiles of water temperatures in different layers. Some of those buoys recorded the passage of Hurricane Isabel, as well. Eventually, all hurricanes with the potential to strike the shore may have their paths monitored in this way, Dr. Black said. Meantime, he said, the data collected on the two hurricanes will provide scientists refining hurricane computer modelers with new details on the workings of the real thing."
"With weather forecasters all but certain Hurricane Isabel will strike the central Atlantic coast late this week, state and local governments up and down the Eastern Seaboard are bracing for what is expected to be an extremely dangerous storm. Computer models showed yesterday that a region from New Jersey to North Carolina was at highest risk for a direct hit, with Washington nearly in the dead center of the storm's projected path, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. Michelle Mainelli, a meteorologist for the administration's National Hurricane Center, said the most recent forecasts showed tropical-storm-force winds lashing the coast of North Carolina early Thursday and hurricane-force winds of 71 miles per hour or more striking Maryland's Chesapeake Bay area later that day. The hurricane could veer as far north as New York and New England or as far south as South Carolina. Weather experts acknowledged that such predictions were never ironclad. But for the first time in the eight days that federal officials have issued advisories about the storm, they said there was almost no chance it would miss the coast entirely. ''Everything points to a landfall,'' Ms. Mainelli said. Forecasters said they expected Isabel to weaken slightly as it neared land, falling from a Category 5 or 4 storm, the most destructive classes of hurricane, to a Category 3. Joe Bastardi, a hurricane expert for Accuweather.com, said that would not be a reason to relax. ''As it comes ashore, a storm like this can expand as it weakens, pulling more and more energy into it and becoming a much more extensive storm,'' Mr. Bastardi said. The hurricane had sustained winds of 140 to 160 m.p.h. as it churned through the South Atlantic last week. Much of yesterday, it registered winds just shy of 156 m.p.h., which is the threshold for the Category 5 rating, as it roiled slowly westward, about 300 miles north of Puerto Rico. The National Hurricane Center has not yet issued a hurricane warning, and no areas have been evacuated. But emergency management teams up and down the coast yesterday watched the storm's progress warily and went over emergency evacuation procedures. Some states may reverse the traffic flows on major coastal roadways to accommodate what will probably be ''a mass exodus,'' said Stephen Leatherman, director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University in Miami. Virginia's Interstate 64 and South Carolina's Interstate 26 will both flow only westward if a storm strikes, state officials said. The decision to route all I-64 traffic west would have to come from the governor, said Bob Spieldenner of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. The National Guard and the state police would help move traffic out of the area. In North Carolina, official decisions about coastal-county evacuations were being held off until Monday or Tuesday. But some residents were already taking precautions. Home-supply and grocery stores had a rush of customers over the weekend, with plywood, generators, batteries, flashlights and bottled water the top sellers. ''No more bottled water,'' read a sign on the door of a Roanoke Island grocery store this afternoon. Gordon Rainey of Nags Head said he planned to get his family off the island. ''This is a severe storm,'' Mr. Rainey said. ''I'll ride out anything under 100 miles per hour, but sustained winds of 160 miles per hour will wipe this island clean. We're not prepared for this.'' Delaware emergency management officials were concerned about Isabel's potential impact on this weekend's Nascar races at Dover International Speedway and the 200,000 fans -- more than six times the population of Dover -- expected to arrive for the races. Teleconferences will update emergency, state and local government authorities on a regular basis, said Jamie Turner, director of Delaware's Emergency Management Agency. If it appears that hurricane-force winds will hit the area, he said, advisories will be issued as early as possible to give people time to get their belongings together and leave the area. In New Jersey, a few shoppers were already buying generators and plywood at the Home Depot in Absecon, across the harbor from Atlantic City. But with sunny weather over much of the state on Sunday, the idea of a major storm seemed an ocean away to most residents. ''We had a couple of people,'' said the store's manager, Pete Giordano. ''There's no mad rush or anything.'' Dr. Leatherman of the International Hurricane Research Center said more people seemed to be preparing for a brush with Hurricane Isabel than they did in 1999 for Hurricane Floyd, which crashed into the Carolina coast. He said he had heard reports that hardware stores were running out of plywood. ''People are taking this one pretty seriously,'' Dr. Leatherman said. ''It's almost the perfect hurricane. It's like a top out there turning 160 m.p.h. round and round.'' In the Hamptons, where vacationers are enjoying the last moments of summer, store shelves are depleted of batteries and conversations have turned to the threat of a hurricane, said Sam Swint, a Southampton resident. Mr. Swint, who said he planned to spend Wednesday and Thursday staking down his smaller trees and clearing his yard of debris, said it had been a decade since a hurricane struck Long Island. People, he said, were eyeing Isabel with a gambler's eye. ''We're somewhat due, to say the least,'' he said. Correction: September 16, 2003, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about precautions against damage from Hurricane Isabel misstated the speed at which winds are considered hurricane-force. It is 74 miles an hour or more, not 71."
"Already relocated from China because of the SARS epidemic, the Women's World Cup is now bracing for the potential disruption of Hurricane Isabel. Organizers took encouragement today in the storm's weakening winds, but they formulated contingency plans for indoor training sites and for the possibility of postponing opening matches because Isabel is expected to hit the East Coast on Thursday. The 16-team tournament is scheduled to begin Saturday at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia with a doubleheader featuring Norway versus France and North Korea against Nigeria. An evening doubleheader is scheduled at Crew Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, with Germany playing Canada followed by Japan and Argentina. The United States, which is training here at the University of Virginia, begins the defense of its title on Sunday at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington against Sweden. Brazil will also play in Washington on Sunday against South Korea in the second game of the doubleheader. Every effort will be made to play the matches as scheduled, as long as the safety of players, stadium workers and fans is protected, organizers said. Most teams are playing three games in eight days in the first round, and further compression of that schedule would begin to affect depth and fitness. At the least, however, heavy rain could have an impact on training schedules, ticket sales and logistical preparations, as well as leaving the playing fields soggy or flooded. Organizers could wait until before Saturday's scheduled kickoffs to decide whether to play or to postpone the doubleheaders in Philadelphia or Columbus, said Jim Moorhouse, a spokesman for the United States Soccer Federation, which is serving as the organizing committee for the Women's World Cup. Any decision would be based on factors like lightning and potential flooding of the fields. ''We are monitoring the situation very closely,'' Moorhouse said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. The final is scheduled to be played at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Calif., outside Los Angeles, on Oct. 12. As a precaution, a search is on for indoor training facilities and alternate outdoor training fields with good drainage, Moorhouse said. If necessary, the games in Philadelphia could be moved to Sunday with relatively little disruption because the Eagles have a bye week and no domestic television broadcast of that doubleheader is scheduled. The situation would be somewhat more complicated if it became necessary to postpone the Sunday doubleheader in Washington, because the United States-Sweden match is scheduled to be broadcast by ABC at 12:30 p.m. Eastern. Forecasters, however, have said the storm should have passed by then. ''The odds of D.C. being affected on Sunday are not very high,'' Moorhouse said. According to news reports, R.F.K. Stadium will serve as a hurricane disaster-relief center in Washington. April Heinrichs, coach of the United States national team, said that no one would be allowed on the stadium turf in that capacity. ''I hope they're putting a tarp on the grass before this moves in,'' Heinrichs said. Already, pretournament buzz suffered when the Women's United Soccer Association, the professional league for dozens of World Cup players, said Monday it would shut down. Now the question becomes whether the hurricane will dampen enthusiasm among ticket buyers. Organizers have already been under pressure to meet a $15 million budget with only four months to prepare for the relocated tournament, compared with two years to plan the 1999 World Cup, which was also played in the United States. Some 280,000 of approximately 600,000 available tickets have been sold for 32 games. That is an impressive number, given that tickets went on sale only two months ago and that this World Cup is competing for entertainment dollars against baseball, high school, college and professional football and youth soccer. Organizers had been counting on a nice, sunny opening weekend to attract even more paying customers. On a beautiful cloudless day here, the United States team continued preparations for its opening match Sunday. The team considered riding out the hurricane here for an extra day but decided to travel to Washington as planned after a morning practice on Wednesday. ''I think it's dying,'' Heinrichs said of Hurricane Isabel. While she is concerned about a possible disruption in training, Heinrichs also said her team needed a day off before facing Sweden. And she said she was not worried about the possibility of losing electricity in the team hotel. She and Julie Foudy, the team captain, told stories of roughing it during the qualifying tournament for the 1991 Women's World Cup (played in China and won by the United States), in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The team went without electricity for days and took to bathing and washing its hair in the hotel pool. ''My books for Stanford were covered in candle wax,'' Foudy said. SOCCER"
"Hurricane Isabel shifted down a gear today, losing some of its wind speed and drifting onto a new track that would skirt Virginia's densely populated Chesapeake Bay region. But it remained a threat to wallop the Outer Banks of North Carolina and cause flooding from central Virginia to Pennsylvania. The storm's winds weakened to 110 miles per hour, down from 125 m.p.h. on Monday. Forecasters said the storm's strength was not likely to change before it made landfall. North Carolina authorities urged nearly 100,000 people to evacuate the coastal areas and barrier islands that are expected to bear the brunt of the storm's fury. The hurricane, which has been chugging northward at a leisurely 7 m.p.h., is expected to hit the Outer Banks on Thursday afternoon. In Elizabeth City, N.C., which lies directly along the storm's projected path, the Coast Guard station plans to move its three C-130 search-and-rescue planes to Charlotte on Wednesday morning. Along nearby roads this evening, the police began preparing to knock on doors and set up roadblocks to speed the evacuation. Less than 50 miles directly north, in Virginia's Tidewater region at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, officials placed workers on alert, moved fire equipment closer to flood zones, spot-checked generators and opened emergency command centers. Under powder-blue skies, a parade of 40 warships, including the Ronald Reagan, the nation's newest aircraft carrier, steamed out of the Norfolk Naval Station for the Atlantic. The Navy also began moving 110 aircraft in the Norfolk region to bases in Florida, Ohio and Louisiana. But with the storm's track appearing to shift westward, state and local officials said they had no plans tonight to urge people to evacuate. ''We're still advising people to pay attention to the news and make decisions based on their needs,'' said Mike Wade, a spokesman for the Virginia Beach Fire Department. ''If they live in low-lying areas, we may advise them to move to shelters, but not leave the area entirely.'' Officials in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania said they remained concerned that the storm would wreak havoc even if it lost much of its punch. The region's water table and streams are already high, and its soil more saturated than normal, because of the summer's heavy rains. Drenching downpours from the hurricane are certain to bring severe flooding across the region, forecasters said. Officials also say that with even moderately strong winds, the storm is likely to knock down many trees whose roots have been loosened by the summer rains. Local power companies are preparing for widespread power failures if some of those trees strike power lines. ''The biggest threat we see with this storm is, we expect, to see a lot of trees and power lines down,'' said Tony Siebers, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in southern Virginia. ''When you get the wind with wet soil, it doesn't take a lot to knock down a tree.'' Still, word that the hurricane was likely to veer west of here drew sighs of relief across Tidewater, where residents and visitors said a mass evacuation would have been a logistical nightmare. With a population of more than 1.2 million, the region includes Virginia's three largest cities -- Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake -- as well as several sprawling naval stations and air bases. They are connected by a few highways and a network of bridges and tunnels that are crowded with traffic most days -- and could have become parking lots during an evacuation. State officials were concerned enough about the region's traffic snarls that they developed a plan to have all lanes on Interstate 64, the main escape route, flow only northwest during a major evacuation. But officials said the storm would probably have to be much more powerful for that to happen. ''The slowing and changing track of the storm throughout the day allows us more time to consider our options on any possible evacuations of low-lying tidal areas,'' Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement this evening. ''However, central and western Virginia could now be at greater risk.'' Many residents here seemed prepared to hunker down and stay. At the Beach Hardware and Paint store in Virginia Beach, Jack Begley bought bags of sand to keep back flood waters. He plans to ride out the storm with his wife and five pets. ''I'm from California, and all I can say is that at least hurricanes give you warning,'' said Mr. Moore, a 56-year-old maintenance director for a nearby Methodist church. ''Earthquakes don't.'' Kathryn Moore, who lives on a beach overlooking the Chesapeake Bay, spent her day preparing for flooding, storing dry goods on counters, stocking up on fresh water and packing away family photos. She plans to leave on Wednesday, but only to go to her daughter's home in downtown Norfolk. ''I'm from the Bronx, and we don't do hurricanes there,'' she said. Paradoxically, many people who have been leaving the area appear to be headed toward Richmond -- which lies along the hurricane's new projected track. By this afternoon, only 1,000 of Richmond's 15,000 hotel and motel rooms were available, said Jack Berry, president and chief executive of the Richmond Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau. He said the situation farther inland was even worse. ''I talked to the bureaus in Lynchburg and Charlottesville around 10 this morning, and they had no rooms left for us,'' Mr. Berry said. ''People are driving in with surfboards on their cars.'' In Washington, some Congressional hearings were canceled because of the approach of the hurricane. The House Resources Committee was supposed to have a hearing on Thursday about two land-transfer bills, but ''we had concerns for some witnesses who would have been flying into Washington,'' said Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for the committee. And depending on the weather forecast, some committee members may leave early for their home districts, Mr. Kennedy said. In Virginia Beach, the beaches and boardwalk were relatively quiet, with many tourists having departed early or canceled their plans to visit. Yet under the warm, cloudless skies today, there were few signs of storm jitters. Only a handful of store and home owners had boarded up their windows. Carnival workers packed up a carousel, but a nearby miniature golf course proclaimed itself open. In the parking lot of one hotel, Barry and Mary Matus from Philadelphia were busy stringing lines on their fishing rods. They plan to leave the area on Wednesday. But they were going to enjoy the sun today. ''Yeah, we're preparing,'' Mr. Matus said. ''We're preparing to fish.''"
"As Hurricane Isabel churned up the Atlantic yesterday, many communities around New York were stoked with fear. But one group -- New York City's surfers -- was just plain stoked, dude. It takes dedication to be a surfer in the city. Entire summers can go by with nothing to ride but knee-slappers. But hurricane season often brings a reprieve. That is when urban surfers hop the A train to the Rockaway Peninsula in southern Queens. Yesterday, a legion of wave-starved surfers from all over the city were hitting the waves off Beach 90th Street with a fervor usually associated with big surf destinations like the Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii or Malibu Beach. While Isabel had not yet shown up, the waves definitely had, and they were much welcomed, along with that other stranger to these parts -- a bright, sunny day. ''We wait all year for this,'' said Christian Miller, 26, a carpenter from Long Beach, on Long Island, who was shredding waves to ribbons with his sleek six-foot surfboard. ''I've surfed all over the world: Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Barbados, but in New York this is about as good as it gets. If the storm's coming here tomorrow, I'll throw some plywood over my windows and get in the water.'' The warm water was packed with surfers: the hang-doggies, the grommets, the cutbackers, the rail-grabbers, the spongeheads. And they planned to be back today. The city police Emergency Services Unit watched them from the boardwalk as mammoth waves rolled in like mountains of water. Light offshore winds obliged the surfers all day by holding up the waves like sloping glassy walls for a few moments before they broke on the shore. The beach, just south of the Cross Bay Bridge, is the Rockaways' most popular surf spot, and while many surfers spend a small fortune on vacations to Costa Rica and Hawaii, many New York surfers simply spend $2 each way in subway fare. Rick Graham, 42, of Astoria, Queens, woke up early yesterday morning and lugged his ''seven-ten'' a 7-foot, 10-inch surfboard, onto the subway. Three trains later, he arrived in Surf City. Mr. Graham is a freelance computer consultant, and like many surfers he arranges the rest of his life around local surf conditions. And surfing always takes priority. ''I must love surfing because I don't make much money working this way,'' he said. ''The last big hurricane here, the cops stopped us and tried to arrest us for reckless endangerment.'' Gary Lindeman was happy with the surf but not with the sudden arrival of all the outsiders. Rockaway surfers guard their turf with a tenacity that defies the laid-back surfer stereotype. He came out of the water and snarled about all the ''mutts'' the big surf was attracting and said that the best local break should be enjoyed by the locals. ''It's not so much that they're outsiders, but 90 percent of them don't know what they're doing,'' he said. ''At least next month they'll all be gone, and we'll have it all to ourselves again.'' In the water, the surfers were jovial with one another, until it came time to compete for a choice wave. They crowded to the tip of the stone jetty. The large waves were breaking onto the jetty, sending salty spray high in the sky. Between sets of waves, the surfers -- most of them in wet suits -- bobbed on their boards to a backdrop of apartment buildings and housing projects and the miles of boardwalk. Jets overhead approached Kennedy International Airport, and the bulldozers moved sand to shore up sections of the beach for the coming storm. The most daring surfers flocked to the tip of the rocky jetty. The trick was to catch a large wave before it crashed onto the boulders, and then be shot out of a large churning barrel of a wave. At one point, a young woman in a floral print bikini paddled out and immediately positioned herself at the front of the lineup near the teeth of the rock jetty. The woman, Jianca Lazarus, 24, grabbed the first big wave to come rolling in ''I'm going, I'm going,'' she yelled, as she paddled in front of its peaking, crashing crest and then dropped down its steep, eight-foot face. Two other men beside her took nosedives into the churning whitewater, but Ms. Lazarus rode the wave until its crest came crashing over her head, creating a barrel-shaped wave around her. She was in surf heaven: she was tubed. ''Man, it is so hollow out here right now,'' she said, paddling back out to the floating surfers. Ms. Lazarus, who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, grew up in South Africa and surfed legendary Johannesburg Bay. ''Everybody is just so stoked about the hurricane.'' Correction: September 18, 2003, Thursday An article yesterday about surfers in New York City who were taking advantage of the waves preceding Hurricane Isabel misstated the name of the South African bay where one surfer, Jianca Lazarus, learned the sport as a child. It is Jeffreys Bay, not Johannesburg Bay."
"With ample warning of Hurricane Isabel's eventual landfall, emergency response planners around the New York region spent a radiant late summer day weighing the what ifs of the season's first big storm while coastal residents playing out their familiar roles in the drama of an approaching storm divided themselves into the worriers and those who wait and see. ''The men are all inside watching the Weather Channel,'' said Barbara Bergen, the keeper of the Bellevue Stratford Inn at Ocean Grove, N.J. ''The women are outside saying, 'What a beautiful day!' '' New Jersey emergency management officials held conference calls yesterday with officials in areas where Isabel could cause flooding. Local officials were on alert at towns including Bound Brook, where the Raritan River peaked at 20 feet over flood stage when Hurricane Floyd struck in 1999, and two people died. Sgt. Kevin Rehmann of the Office of Emergency Management at the New Jersey State Police said the track of the storm, now aimed at the Outer Banks of North Carolina, would determine the state's response. ''We could do everything from establishing evacuation routes, which we've already done, to the governor announcing a state of emergency and calling out the Guard,'' Sergeant Rehmann said. ''Each municipality is required to have an emergency coordinator, and of course we've been in touch with them.'' Gov. James E. McGreevey held a cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon to weigh the storm's possible effects, and then polled mayors and electric and water utilities on their state of preparedness. He said the state's schools would probably operate on normal schedules unless the storm worsened for New Jersey or the schools were needed for emergency evacuations. Around the region, the storm was on residents' minds, but not necessarily dominating their concerns. The surf has been high at Belmar on the Jersey Shore for days now, and the waves hid the surfers from view yesterday, even those who knelt on their boards, conning the ocean for incoming rollers. There were more surfboards than plywood on trucks around the beach at Ocean City, although some businesses, particularly those on the bays, were shuttering their windows. Officials said there were no signs of people panicking and leaving the area before any evidence of danger. But they urged residents to prepare for the worst, which would be for Isabel to take a right turn at the Gulf Stream and head north toward New Jersey and Long Island. ''The main message is to be prepared, not scared,'' said Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, after he held his own disaster coordination meeting with local officials and met with reporters in Garden City. ''Nassau County is ready in the event of a hurricane,'' Mr. Suozzi said. Like other officials, Mr. Suozzi urged residents to follow reports of Isabel's progress, and to have food, flashlights and water at hand. All areas of the region got welcome news last night when Isabel's power waned a bit, and the storm's course held for the homes and businesses farther south."
"With nearly 600,000 customers still without power in Virginia and Maryland, many critics of the utility industry contend that the companies have cut spending on vital operations in search of profits. As a result, the critics say, power lines are more vulnerable to falling trees, and repair crews are shorthanded. The real villain, they argue, is deregulation, which has increased pressure on utilities to cut costs and, perhaps, cut corners on maintenance. ''They have cut back significantly on front line or direct services personnel,'' said David Hughes, executive director of Citizen Power, a watchdog group in Pittsburgh. ''We saw it on the turnpike here, where 100 Detroit Edison trucks were heading down to help on Isabel.'' But many experts say the true picture is far more complex. Records indicate that most utilities have kept maintenance spending level in recent years. Dominion Virginia Power and Potomac Electric Power have increased the number of their frontline repair crews since deregulation. A survey of recent storms shows that many utilities are on pace to restore power almost as quickly as in past hurricanes -- even though Isabel knocked out power to more homes than any storm in memory. ''No two storms are the same,'' said Tim Pettit of Duke Power, which spent three weeks restoring power to 696,000 customers that lost power in September 1989 after Hurricane Hugo, a Category 4 storm. ''You have got variables that come into play with all of them.'' In coming weeks, public service commissions in Maryland and Virginia will begin preliminary reviews of the utilities' preparations for and responses to the hurricane, officials in both states said. If shortcomings are found, the commissions will order in-depth investigations that could take months and involve detailed examinations of spending, personnel and policies. Such investigations could become forums for complaints about deregulation, experts said. ''We'll want to see what they did right and whether there are lessons to be learned,'' said Sandra Guthorn, acting people's counsel in Maryland, the state's consumer advocate on utility problems. The maintenance budgets of the two biggest Maryland utilities appear to have held mostly steady since they began reorganizing in the late 90's. Pepco spent $34 million last year on maintaining power lines, more than the $31 million that it spent in 1997 but less than its $40 million in 1999, according to the Maryland Public Service Commission. Baltimore Gas and Electric spent $36 million in 1997, then almost $48 million in 1999 and about $39 million last year. Dominion Virginia spent far less on maintaining its distribution system last year than 2001, $47 million compared with more than $86 million. It explained the difference as a result of an accounting change. The State Corporation Commission has asked it to restate as soon as possible the distribution maintenance costs under the old system, as the first step to what the state says would be an inquiry into the preparedness for the storm last week. Most of the distribution maintenance budget of a utility goes to tree trimming, a seemingly mundane procedure that nonetheless summons intensely emotional reactions from consumers. After an ice storm in January 2000, Virginia regulators pushed Dominion to be more aggressive in tree trimming because ''it had placed too much emphasis on aesthetics and the wishes of property owners at the expense of reliability,'' according to a report by the State Corporation Commission. Dominion has complied, shearing parts of trees near power line rights of way. But even that was not enough to prevent nearly two million customers from losing power last week. ''I've never seen the breadth of damage that we have out there,'' M. Stuart Bolton Jr., senior vice president of financial management for Dominion, said. ''We're talking 100-foot trees, 40 inches in diameter, that toppled. No tree-trimming program would have mitigated these outages.'' Some experts also say the utilities cannot be faulted for some of the problems that made the storm particularly destructive and that have complicated the cleanup. One factor, they said, was that the hurricane last week knocked down more trees than any storm in memory. That was not because of high winds as much as sodden soils caused by record rainfalls. The weather loosened tree roots across the East Coast, making them vulnerable even to moderate winds, experts said. As a result, Isabel toppled far more trees than Hurricane Floyd in 1999, even though their winds were comparable. ''The trees weren't as strong,'' Bernie Rayno, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather in State College, Pa., said. ''You factor wind in, and you have a lot of downed trees.'' Second, many counties and cities in the region have fallen behind in pruning or cutting down sick and dead trees, many of which tumbled on to power lines. Officials in Washington and Montgomery County, Md., said today that they would push to add spending for tree removal. ''Our backlog is staggering,'' Councilman Adrian M. Fenty of Washington said. ''The district may be at fault for letting trees get enormous and old.'' Third, many utilities were unable to send out-of-state crews into the region right away because utilities all along the Eastern Seaboard wanted to wait to see whether the hurricane hit their areas. Moreover, because of the wide swath, utilities in Maryland and Virginia had to reach as far as Arizona, Michigan and Texas to recruit emergency crews, some of which did not arrive until well after the storm had arrived. Still, power company officials say they had as many out-of-state workers in place before the storm as they could handle. For all the complaints, the utilities are on a pace to match their performances after past hurricanes, provided that they meet their own goals of restoring power by this weekend. When, for instance, Hurricane Floyd -- like Isabel, a Category 2 storm with winds of 100 miles an hour at landfall -- struck North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland in 1999, Dominion needed 10 days to restore power for 700,000 customers. Baltimore Gas and Electric took eight days to return electricity to 320,000 homeowners and businesses. Both utilities had more than twice as many customers lose power this year than in 1999."
"The power went out on Thursday night. The lines started the next day, snaking down the aisle, out the door and into the parking lot of the local 7-Eleven. Every morning, residents in this hurricane-battered town have set out in search of an essential part of their electricity-free daily lives. They waited, up to 45 minutes, not for ice, batteries, bottled water or food. They wanted coffee. ''You can't start the day without a good cup of coffee,'' said Beth Powell, who, like most people here in rural Westmoreland County, has no electricity and hence no easy way to brew coffee. Tucked in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, this tourist area about halfway between Richmond and Washington was among the hardest hit by Hurricane Isabel. The shoreline was flooded when the winds pushed the Potomac River backward over the land. Dominion Virginia Power, which provides electricity to most of the state, says that because this area is relatively rural it will take up to two weeks to restore power fully here. Like hundreds of others, Ms. Powell, meanwhile, has come to the 7-Eleven, one of the few businesses with electricity, to buy a cup of coffee every morning since the storm hit. Grasping a 24-ounce cup, she nodded at the coffeemakers, which were dripping away. ''Look how many pots they have here,'' she said. ''They don't let us down.'' Coffee is among the few creature comforts for Ms. Powell these days. She has no water because she depends on an electric water pump; no working landline phone because her family has only cordless phones, which work only with electricity; and no cellphone service because her carrier's cell towers were also affected by the storm and the power failures. So on Saturday, Ms. Powell made four trips to her brother's house in town, which still had running water, to bring back buckets of water in her sport utility vehicle. By 9:30 a.m. today, her husband had already made another trip into town for more water. (He decided to skip the coffee at 7-Eleven when he saw the long line.) Ms. Powell drives to a neighbors's home to make phone calls. She boils water outdoors on a grill for sponge baths. ''It's like living in the 20's,'' muttered one woman who was waiting in line at the 7-Eleven to buy coffee. In the aftermath of Isabel, many people here have adopted the kind of lifestyle that was commonplace when this region was not only rural, but agricultural. They are early to bed and early to rise, adjusting their body clocks to the sun. They use ice to cool their food. They cook food on wood-burning stoves or outdoor grills. They wash their clothes by hand and hang them on lines to dry. They draw water with buckets, but from the houses of family and friends. Still, most of the residents here are not quite fazed -- yet. They went through a similar experience after a 1994 ice storm left some in the community without power for 12 days. But Isabel caused more damage than any other natural event in recent memory; the only worse storm that some people here recall is Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Unlike the large urban areas of Washington and Richmond, which also suffered huge power failures, Westmoreland County has only about 17,000 residents, and many people know one another. So, neighbors with water or electricity have opened up their homes so those without can shower or use the telephone. They have moved generators from house to house or strung extension cords across streets. And they have made copious amounts of coffee. One man drove an hour to bring in oxygen tanks for his mother, who has a chronic trouble breathing and uses a respirator. Another woman brought pizza from two hours away. One man drove an hour southwest to Richmond to bring back milk for the local supermarket, which managed to stay open. Even without electricity, there were tentative stirrings of commerce at the local strip mall. The pharmacist doled out two or three pills to customers with prescriptions, to tide them over until the computer systems were running. With the banks closed since Wednesday, the businesses that remained open had to change money with each other. Halls, the only supermarket in three counties that managed to stay open after the storm, got $300 in dollar bills from a local waitress and $500 from the 7-Eleven. With churches dimmed by a lack of power, congregations were forced to improvise. Some prayed outside. People squinted to read their hymnals. One church brought in a battery-powered organ.. The Rite-Aid drug store was open, but was selling only items with the price marked, since the registers and scanners were not working. A woman who wanted to buy tennis balls could not, because they are a seasonal item and not marked. ''I just explained to her that I didn't know what to charge,'' said Linda Farneth, the cashier. Even the local video store was doing brisk business. Comedies were noticeably popular. ''People don't want to watch horror movies,'' said Debbie Fines, the manager of the video store, Movie Gallery. '' 'Twister' is definitely not on the best rental list this week.''"
"Nature endowed the Outer Banks of North Carolina with great beauty -- long ribbons of sand with Atlantic Ocean waves on one side and marsh-fringed bays and sounds on the other. But the people who flocked to the Banks have been interfering with this fragile natural landscape for decades, and the infrastructure they have built -- in particular the highway that runs along the islands that make up the Outer Banks and possibly the artificial dune that lines their beaches -- has diminished the islands' natural ability to survive a storm like Hurricane Isabel and recover from its effects, geologists say. So, as engineers contemplate eroded beaches, a broken highway and a new inlet cutting across Hatteras Island, they are struggling to find a way to restore the Outer Banks tourism infrastructure while respecting the demands of its landscape. In particular, they are looking for a way to maintain State Highway 12, the main road, while allowing the islands to shift, as they would naturally, in response to episodes of heavy weather and long-term rising seas. That will not be easy. The Outer Banks is really only filaments of sand running across ancient river channels, relics of the last ice age, when sea levels were far lower and the coastline was hundreds of miles farther out than it is today, said William A. Birkemeier, chief of the Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility at Duck, N.C., an Outer Banks village about 60 miles north of where the hurricane made landfall. Monitoring, measuring and other research efforts undertaken before, during and immediately after the storm will eventually provide useful guidance for coastal engineers, Mr. Birkemeier said. But the problems are pressing now. In this era of rising sea levels, the Outer Banks is trying to migrate inland. Much of this migration is accomplished in storms like the latest one, when sand washes across the island from sea to sound. Marsh plants colonize the sound, the beach ecosystem colonizes the marsh, and the island gradually shifts position. This is the process coastal geologists say has been hindered on much of the Outer Banks. Though it looks natural, the dune that runs for 50 miles along the Banks was man-made, created out of wood and brush and sand by the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps. Some coastal geologists say the dune has functioned as a kind of sea wall, blocking much of the overwash of sand from beach to marsh. Today only a major storm carries much sand across the island, they say. Without the dune, the beaches of the Outer Banks ''would be overwashed constantly,'' said Orrin H. Pilkey Jr., a Duke University geologist who is famous in North Carolina for his advocacy of letting nature take its course on the coast. Also, he said evidence suggested that the presence of the dune altered wave action such that the slope of the beach in the surf zone steepened, which, in turn, would cause waves to strike it with greater force. Engineers like Mr. Birkemeier and some coastal geologists are not convinced. ''I don't think the artificial dune has made the island more vulnerable,'' said Rob Young, an associate professor of geology at Western Carolina University, who studied with Dr. Pilkey and who was out on the Banks as the sun rose on Friday, the day after the storm. ''Primarily what that dune did was provide a false sense of security and put off the inevitable, Dr. Young said. ''The real danger is Highway 12.'' There is wide agreement that efforts to keep the road in place have harmed the islands of the Outer Banks. When heavy storms bury it in sand, the sand is typically swept up and carried back onto the beach in crude piles. The marsh, deprived of this sand, shrinks as sea levels rise. Because the islands are so flat -- in some places, geologists say, their natural elevation is only about three feet -- even a small rise in water level can make drastic inroads on both marsh and beach. And in places the islands have narrowed sharply, to the point that in some spots the walk from ocean to sound is 100 yards or fewer. There are parts of the seashore, Dr. Young said, that are where they are ''only to keep Highway 12 in place.'' ''If Highway 12 was not there, these portions would be able to migrate back naturally,'' he said. ''They might not have giant dunes, but they would be functioning ecosystems. Because Highway 12 has to stay where it is, every time Highway 12 is overwashed it is scraped back up into hideous, debris-filled dunes. And they are getting larger and larger, and after this storm they are going to be extremely large.'' Overwashed in other storms, Highway 12 actually broke up in spots this time, as it was undermined and collapsed. So engineers must decide how -- and where -- to rebuild. Stretches of the highway, so important to the Banks that its mileposts function as addresses, have been moved inland before, but now the road builders are bumping up against the marshes and duck ponds that line the sound. But as Dr. Pilkey notes, ''they have no way to move back along most of this without getting into the wetlands and the duck ponds.'' Michael A. Turchy, a biologist with the North Carolina Department of Transportation, said the department was considering building a causeway that would run behind the islands. But this would be a complicated engineering effort, and its environmental effects might be substantial. Anyway, Mr. Turchy added: ''In looking at what happened with Isabel, you have to wonder what's going to happen in the next storm. A future causeway could be vulnerable to future storms.'' Just as pressing is the decision about what to do between the villages of Hatteras and Frisco, where the latest storm cut a substantial inlet through the barrier island. Normally, inlets like this close on their own, but this one is so big -- it was 150 yards wide on Friday, Dr. Young said -- that it may be a permanent feature. As a result, the village of Hatteras is its own small island now, cut off except for the ferry that runs west to the small island of Ocracoke, where other ferries take more than two hours to reach Cedar Island or Swan Quarter, small towns on the quiet western shore of Pamlico Sound. Temporarily, Mr. Turchy said, the North Carolina Department of Transportation is considering altering the Hatteras-Ocracoke ferry run to include stops across the new inlet at Frisco. But a dock would have to be built there, he said. ''We're not sure how long that would take. It hasn't been done.'' Also, it is not clear that this kind of ferry service could accommodate tourism traffic or allow timely evacuation in future storms. Engineers might also consider filling the inlet. That is what was done after the Ash Wednesday storm of 1962, still the benchmark for bad weather on the Atlantic Coast, when an inlet was cut at Buxton, not far from the new inlet. ''It was very difficult to fill it in,'' Dr. Pilkey said. ''It took several tries. You really have to marshal all your forces and throw it in all at once, otherwise it gets washed out.'' The new inlet is the first to form on the Banks since then. There are only two other inlets -- Oregon Inlet and Ocracoke Inlet -- on Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. ''There have been more in the past,'' Dr. Young said. ''We should not be too surprised that the Outer Banks could easily accommodate a third or even a fourth inlet that would remain open.'' Dr. Young recalled that an inlet opened on Pawley's Island, S.C., during Hurricane Hugo in 1989. ''That inlet was nothing compared to this,'' he said. ''They closed it, but it wasn't easy. This one is way bigger.'' He said engineers might want to bulldoze sand from either side of the inlet to fill it, ''but the adjacent portions of the barrier island have lost their sand -- they are just three feet in elevation. There is no sand. It's in the sound, offshore, but not on the beach.'' As a result, he said, he feared there would be pressure to bridge the inlet. ''I hope they take a deep breath and don't rush into making a decision,'' he said. ''I am sure there is some panic because Hatteras village is isolated right now. I am worried there is going to be tremendous political and emotional pressure to do something fast like build a bridge right away.'' That, he said, would be ''another example where the National Seashore will be sacrificed to create infrastructure; because the shoreline does not need a bridge.''"
"President Bush spends hours each day of his Texas vacation with his trusty chain saw, happily cutting up the cedar trees that he is determined to clear one of these decades from his 1,600-acre ranch. Clearly, putting in time with the saw is recreation for Mr. Bush, a sweat-through-the-T-shirt kind of guy activity that clears his head and helps him relax. Because when it came to clearing the North Lawn of the White House last week of a big linden tree felled by Hurricane Isabel, Mr. Bush left the chain-sawing to the National Park Service and stayed on higher ground at Camp David. The linden, it turned out, was the main casualty visited upon the White House by the storm, which like all acts of nature was democratic in its force. Washingtonians spent the weekend clearing downed trees and branches, and so too did the staff of the White House, which at the end of the day is still a home. ''I thought we were lucky we only lost one tree,'' said Dale Haney, the White House horticulturist, who stepped over the branches in his own suburban Virginia yard to reach the North Lawn by 6:30 a.m. Friday, when he surveyed the damage that had worried him all night. What Mr. Haney saw relieved him, but the scene was still surprising. The normally pristine North Lawn was strewn with the huge branches of the century-old linden tree, which had split in half. The tree stood not far from the large circular fountain off Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Haney, who has been tending the 18 1/2 acres of White House grounds for three decades, said the linden had been supported by cables, and was properly trimmed and healthy. But the wind nonetheless brought it down -- the first time, as far as he knew, that a hurricane had toppled a White House tree. To Mr. Haney's further relief, the linden was not one of the 48 trees planted by presidents on the White House grounds, like the two Andrew Jackson southern magnolias on the west side of the South Portico or the four saucer magnolias planted by John F. Kennedy in the Rose Garden. (The current Bushes have planted a cut-leaf maple on the South Lawn.) The White House began preparing for the storm at midweek, when workers took down flags and awnings and cleared drains, like everyone else in town. By Wednesday afternoon, the president and Mrs. Bush were on Marine One to Camp David for the weekend a day earlier than planned, to beat the storm, while two of the planes that serve as Air Force One, a 747 and a 757, were flown to Robins Air Force Base in Georgia for safekeeping. By Thursday, with the White House rapidly emptying, maintenance workers moved in for last-minute hurricane preparations. ''The whole staff was in, so it didn't take long,'' Mr. Haney said. ''Plumbers, electricians, everybody pitched in.'' Pots of petunias and coleus from the White House's five patios were taken in, as were the potted myrtle trees. Large hanging baskets of begonias were nestled into flower beds, and outdoor furniture was stashed in the West Garden Room at the end of the Rose Garden colonnade. At Camp David, Mr. Bush held a news conference on Thursday morning with King Abdullah of Jordan -- again, a day earlier than planned. ''I know this was supposed to take place at a different time,'' the president told reporters, ''but we wanted to get this over with so that you didn't have to float down the hill, if you know what I mean.'' Hurricane Isabel also allowed Mr. Bush a natural cutoff to all the unpleasant questions about the Middle East and Iraq. ''All right, get going before it starts raining,'' the president told reporters, ending the news conference after 16 minutes. At the White House on Thursday evening, with the chief occupants slumbering at Camp David, the hurricane watch was left to the usual security people as well as two Park Service employees who spent the night on cots in a maintenance shed in a far corner of the South Lawn, nervously checking every crash and bump in the dark. The pair armed themselves with chain saws -- the White House has two -- and remained alert for branches and trees falling on the drives near the White House. ''They were in and out all night long,'' Mr. Haney said. ''I don't know know if they got much sleep.'' By Friday morning at Camp David, King Abdullah and his wife, Queen Rania, were preparing to return to Jordan, but there was no news from the White House on how the president had whiled away the stormy night in the Catoctin Mountains with the king. A few trees did fall at Camp David, said a White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, ''but none of them posed any danger to the president.'' Back in Washington, where the storm left millions in the city and surrounding states without power (the lights stayed on at the White House, to no one's surprise) Vice President Dick Cheney spent part of his morning surveying the downed branches on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, where he lives. Or, at least, a man who looked remarkably like Mr. Cheney, with a black Labrador retriever and what appeared to be grandchildren in tow, could be seen walking near the observatory's outer fence if you happened to be cruising down Massachusetts Avenue around 11 a.m. No word on whether the vice president took up a chain saw. White House Letter"
"THE day after Hurricane Fabian ravaged Bermuda early this month, The Royal Gazette printed a photograph that became the talk of the island. It showed a boat with the wildly inappropriate name of Tiptoe that had crashed into a deserted guest room at the Sonesta Beach Hotel, landing in a puddle of curtains and bedding. ''Boats in the rooms and TV's on the beach, that sums up this storm,'' Paul Tormey, general manager of the Fairmont Hamilton Princess, the grande dame hotel in Bermuda's capital, Hamilton, said on Sept. 16. Although Hurricane Isabel eclipsed Fabian in the United States, no one who experienced Bermuda's worst hurricane in 40 years is likely to forget Fabian anytime soon. For 12 relentless hours, the storm pummeled the island with 120- to 140-mile-an-hour winds, spawned small tornados and unleashed a towering surge of ocean that doused much of the island in salt water. Trees were uprooted, beaches routed and windows blown out. On an island that hadn't seen a severe hurricane in 16 years and where gale-force winds typically last three to four hours, Fabian was bigger, nastier and more destructive than anything most Bermudans can recall. Yet they also marvel that Fabian's damage wasn't worse. Though thousands of homes were without electricity for days, in some cases weeks, most large hotels and businesses never lost power. Long-distance telephone service, essential now that international business is the major contributor to the country's economy, was quickly restored, aided by linesmen flown in from the Caribbean. Residents wielding machetes and chain saws joined government workers the morning after the storm to clear away fallen trees, enabling several main roads to open shortly after the storm. And while the bright-blue plastic sheeting fluttering atop buildings is testimony to the white roof tiles blown off during the storm, Bermuda's signature sherbet-colored buildings, with 10-inch-thick walls made of concrete and island limestone, look remarkably untouched. ''If we'd had frame houses, everything would have been flattened,'' said Vince Cann, a cabdriver whose house was undamaged. Some of the worst damage was sustained by the two-lane causeway to the airport, which was partly washed away by the surge. Four people were killed (the only hurricane-related deaths) and the airport was forced to close, reopening five days later when one causeway lane was restored. Highway traffic to the airport this month slowed to a crawl, but authorities expect the causeway to be back to two lanes in the next few weeks. ''No one can deny that we're facing challenges caused by the hurricane,'' said Alex Scott, premier of Bermuda. ''But since the Monday after the storm, Bermuda has been open for business.'' Indeed, while parts of the island look battered, notably the charming East End Town of St. George, which was pounded by the surge, visitors can expect a nearly full complement of amenities and activities. Taxis are plentiful (if as costly as ever), and the pink public buses are running most routes, as are the ferries. Hamilton's fancy clothing and jewelry shops, more upmarket than a decade ago, seem untouched by the storm, and all but a handful of the island's 77 restaurants are open. Although Bermuda's eight golf courses lost trees, six have cleared their debris and reopened, with Belmont Hills scheduled to join them on Wednesday and the Fairmont Southampton course closed until further notice. Still closed indefinitely are the Botanical Garden and a few tennis courts. But the six cruise ships that dock here each week were back after a one-week absence. Residents seem particularly proud that the country's line-up of autumn amusements will proceed as scheduled, including the Bermuda Jazz Festival from Oct. 9 to 11 and the King Edward VII Gold Cup regatta Oct. 18 to 26. The only scratch so far has been a bicycle race, canceled because of poor road conditions. The storm treated the island's lodging establishments capriciously, harming some but leaving others unscathed. Nearly all the damaged properties have made repairs and reopened except three that suffered severe damage -- the Pink Beach Club, a glamorous 94-room cottage community, which plans to reopen in March; the 593-room Fairmont Southampton, Bermuda's largest hotel, which will close for two to six months; and the 400-room Sonesta, to undergo a major renovation before reopening in May. Although Bermuda has 62 hotels and lodging establishments, the three damaged properties account for 40 percent of the island's rooms, leaving industry officials concerned about the potential loss of visitors and revenue. ''It is not in the country's best interest to have to have these hotels offline for long,'' said William Griffith, president of Bermuda Resort Hotels, a boutique hotel group that includes the Harmony Club. The Fairmont Southampton, for example, is the only hotel here that can accommodate large groups. ''We had to move some group business off the island since no one here could handle it,'' said Norman Mastalir, the hotel's general manager and president of the Bermuda Hotel Association. One local businessman even suggested leasing a cruise ship and docking it in Bermuda for use as a floating hotel for six months or so. Nonetheless, hoteliers sound grateful that the hurricane struck in September and not in July. Unlike the Caribbean, Bermuda's season runs from April through October. ''Bermuda is coming out of its high season, and the island has more than enough rooms to entertain people successfully,'' said Michael Winfield, president of Cambridge Beaches, a discreet luxury cottage community on the West End. For now, hotel officials hope that the specter of post-hurricane Bermuda will not deter visitors. Nancy and Roy Kapanka of Nazareth, Pa., received a call from the owner of the hotel where they have stayed each September for the past 10 years, encouraging them to come as planned the week after the hurricane. ''I said as long as there was electricity and the causeway was open, we'd be there,'' Mrs. Kapanka said on the plane to Bermuda. But most hotels reported cancellations for the days immediately after Fabian, and there are concerns that guests will postpone visits to the spring. What can a visitor to Bermuda expect to see in the next few weeks? From the inside of most buildings here, you would never know nature had run wild. Stroll through the immaculate, chandelier lighted lobby of Elbow Beach, a majestic 95-year-old hotel overlooking Bermuda's south shore, and you'll see businessmen dressed in blazers, knee socks and Technicolor Bermuda shorts stride purposefully past flower-adorned tables while guests in flip-flops relax on a sofa in the lounge, catching a movie on a flat-screen television. Step outside, however, and the landscape bears testimony to Fabian's wrath. On a verdant island, the trees stand leafless and forlorn, and ferns are withered and brown, burned by the salt water. Trucks hauling huge heaps of horticultural debris drive past decapitated palm trees bent at improbable angles. And throughout the island, casarina trees, with their shallow roots, lie lifeless on their sides as if a giant had plucked them out of the ground. ''Two weeks ago, this garden could have won an award,'' said David Saul, a former premier of Bermuda, looking at his devastated yard. ''But Bermuda gets 65 inches of rain a year, and it will all grow back. In two years you will never know the hurricane was here.'' Some of the damage to natural sites is permanent, unfortunately. Natural Arches, an expanse of cliff that years of erosion had fashioned into a graceful arch over the beach on the south shore near the East End, was completely washed away. Parts of several beaches were also lost, but the surf will bring much of the sand back, local residents say. And if nature doesn't restore the beaches, help is promised. Using jets supplied by several Bermuda corporations, the government has conducted reconnaissance flights over the island. ''We have a digital map of the Bermuda that was, which we will compare with the Bermuda that is, so we can put it back in place,'' Mr. Scott said. While no one would call Fabian a blessing, some people here concede that the hurricane may prompt some much-needed changes. It crystallized the need for a bridge or some kind of replacement for the two-lane causeway. The hurricane also illustrated the advantage of underground power sources, and may speed up the country's efforts to move wires below ground. ''With underground power lines, you're out 48 to 72 hours instead of days or weeks,'' said Philip Butterfield, chief operating officer of the Bank of Bermuda.

"WITHOUT weather satellites, and before radar had been introduced as a forecasting tool, the people of Long Island never saw the meteorological beast before it pounced on Sept. 21, 1938, 65 years ago next Sunday. A mighty hurricane roared in from the Atlantic. Sustained winds were 120 miles per hour as the storm's eye came ashore at Westhampton Beach. Fifty-one people died on the Island, which suffered about $365 million worth of damage, estimated in today's dollars. In the days before such storms were given official names, the 1938 hurricane was dubbed the Long Island Express because it advanced at speeds of up to 60 m.p.h. and, after finishing with the Island, it hit five New England states in just six hours. It remains the most devastating weather event on Long Island, and with about 600 total deaths it was the fourth deadliest hurricane in United States history. In addition to those killed, 63,000 were left homeless, 8,900 buildings were destroyed, 3,300 boats were lost and two billion trees were destroyed. Numerous signs of the storm's brutality remain on the East End. (Being on the west side of the storm, the rest of Suffolk County and Nassau sustained less damage.) The landmark Old Whalers Church in Sag Harbor has a curiously boxy, squat appearance, its huge steeple having been toppled in the storm and never replaced. The fishing village on the strip of land between Fort Pond Bay and Fort Pond was obliterated, never to be rebuilt. The most prominent reminders are the Shinnecock Inlet and the Shinnecock Canal, gouged out of the land by the storm and later dredged and lined and made hospitable for boat traffic. A person born the day of the '38 Storm would just be approaching the traditional retirement age today. But many who lived through it and were old enough to understand what was happening are still around, and their memories of the event tend to be vivid. Sherrill Foster, the East Hampton town historian, was a junior at East Hampton High School in the fall of 1938. Someone, she said, called the principal on Sept. 21 to tell him that a hurricane was approaching. '''We don't have hurricanes here,' he said, and slammed the phone down,'' Ms. Foster, 81, said recently in her home in East Hampton. ''But when the kindergarteners were let out and they were being blown up against the chain-link fence, it was clear this was no ordinary storm. ''We were told to go to our seats in the auditorium,'' she continued. ''Most of the students, like my brother Edwin, just left and walked home. The Montauk kids were being put up in East Hampton because it was already too late to call out the buses. I sat in the auditorium, and the two gym teachers, male and female, came in with a record player. They put a record on and started dancing to reassure the students, but it was obvious they were scared to death.'' She was soon brought home in her father's milk truck. ''It was a frightening day and night, and there was some damage to the farmhouse,'' Ms. Foster remembered. ''The next day, a gorgeous one, my mother took my brother and me to Montauk. Napeague Stretch was under water. After we got through we went to the fishing village, where we had relatives and my mother had lived as a child. It was gone.'' The residents of the fishing village survived, and the oral history collection at the Montauk Library explains how. It includes a reminiscence by Gus Pitts, one of the port's first charter boat captains. Interviewed in 1994 -- he died last year at age 97 -- he recalled being on Lake Montauk that afternoon and seeing ''the tidal wave coming over the jetty'' and then ''a puff of wind'' blowing his father's car into the air, never to be found. His family and about 100 other residents of the village survived because they climbed aboard a Long Island Rail Road train on a track six feet higher than the beach and it took them west to higher ground. Ria Del Bene, an 83-year-old Westhampton Beach resident, remembers watching the water draining from Moniebogue Canal behind Main Street. ''Not being knowledgeable about tidal waves, I didn't realize that the water gets sucked out, then comes back in a tidal wave,'' she recalled. She also watched as ''the wind picked up a large wild cherry tree, at least 100 years old, pulled it up, roots and all, and then laid it on the ground like a huge bouquet.'' Richard Hendrickson, a Bridgehampton farmer who has been an official observer for the Weather Service for 73 years, said Long Island and Manhattan were actually lucky because of the speed of the storm. ''It was the fastest-moving hurricane ever recorded,'' said Mr. Hendrickson, who is 91. ''If it had been slower, it would have flooded the South Fork and washed away half of both eastern forks. Then it would have flooded the Sound, raising water levels all the way to the city, flooding the lower half of Manhattan.'' In 1938, Mr. Hendrickson was raising breeding hens and selling the eggs from the thousands of chickens he owned. During the storm, two of his six henhouses were blown away. The chickens did not fare any better. ''The wind blew the chicks against my six-foot-high fence and the rain drowned them,'' he recalled. With the hurricane far from being a distant memory, the questions 65 years later are: Could it happen again, and what have we learned? The answers are yes, and not much, said Michael Wyllie, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service office in Upton. ''We haven't seen anything like the 1938 storm, and maybe that has prompted some complacency,'' he said. ''But if a strong Category 3 hurricane like that one hit today, it would be the biggest natural disaster the country has seen, period. We have built up the coast of southern Long Island pretty much with abandon. We just did whatever we wanted to do. There really hasn't been much in the way of regulation in those 65 years.'' During the last two decades there have been some big blows, especially Hurricane Gloria in 1985 and Bob in 1991. Mr. Wyllie pointed out, however, that both were Category 1, the weakest class of hurricane, and because the eye of Bob passed to the east of Montauk Point, the Island was spared the worst of the storm's winds. ''The damage was a few billion dollars in 1938 because of the lower population and development,'' Mr. Wyllie said, adjusting for inflation and including damage beyond the Island. ''Estimates are, if we got hit with that same storm today, we're looking at a $75 billion loss.'' The record for storm damage is held by Hurricane Andrew, which wreaked an inflation-adjusted $20 billion worth of havoc on South Florida in 1992. The $75 billion estimate was echoed by AIR Worldwide Corporation in Boston, a risk-assessment company that recently completed a study on the impact of a storm similar to the one in 1938. Karen Clark, chief executive of the company, said that $40 billion of the estimated total damage would occur in Suffolk, Nassau, Queens and Brooklyn. ''The biggest influence on that figure is if a storm were to hit Long Island at high tide like the one in '38 did,'' Ms. Clark said. ''A lot of the damage would be caused by the storm surge.'' Stephen Leatherman, director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University in Miami and a consultant at Southampton College of Long Island University, has predicted that a ''killer hurricane'' will ravage the South Shore of Long Island in the next 15 to 20 years. ''There's even more vulnerability now than in 1938,'' said Dr. Leatherman, who recently completed a three-year laser-mapping of the shoreline from the Moriches Inlet to Montauk. ''Since '38 the sea level on the South Shore of Long Island has crept up a half a foot or so, and beach recession has averaged 1.5 feet per year. This tells you the beaches and the dunes are more narrow, meaning less of a barrier against the storm surge. And of course the amount of building that has gone on is enormous. It's phenomenal. I've looked at some of the aerial photos from the '30s and compare them to what I see today, and you can hardly recognize it.'' Dr. Leatherman noted that Hurricane Fabian, which hammered Bermuda on Sept. 5, followed a track similar to that of the '38 Storm before turning northeast. ''That's just one hurricane that gave us pause, so there is definitely a vulnerability,'' he said. ''Looking at the historical data, there's roughly a 75-year frequency to these big ones. I think right now we're pretty close to the median time when you have to really worry. To think it won't happen is like expecting someone flipping a coin and getting 10 heads in a row.'' Yet this and similar warnings have mostly gone unheeded during six decades of real estate development, including a heavy buildup of South Shore bay- and oceanfront properties. When a mere northeaster in 1992 wrecked a stretch of the barrier beach west of Westhampton Beach, the homes there were not only rebuilt bigger and better, but its residents also incorporated a new village, West Hampton Dunes, to protect their right to rebuild oceanfront residences after storm damage. A similar motivation underlies the effort now under way to incorporate the Village of Dune Hampton along the eastern coast of Southampton Town. The actor Roy Scheider has been the most visible proponent of Dune Hampton and an opponent of the town's recently enacted Coastal Erosion Hazard Law, which bans permanent shore-hardening structures and seeks to restrict oceanfront development. ''Living at the beach is risky, and you pay high insurance prices for the privilege,'' Mr. Scheider said. ''There are many of us here, we've been here a long time, and we accept the risk. ''I know there are people who consider us damn fools and that you shouldn't live at the beach anyhow, but it's a free country and it's our choice,'' Mr. Scheider continued. ''We paid the price to be here, and we'll pay the price to not be here. But it's our decision, and that should be respected.'' The attitude of waterfront owners can be vexing to lawmakers. ''People love to live on the beach, and they are willing to live with the risk until the risk comes, and then they'd like you to bail them out,'' said Dennis Suskind, a Southampton town councilman. ''That's human nature.'' The risk may be greater than some oceanfront homeowners realize. ''Storm surge damage is excluded from a lot of insurance policies today,'' Ms. Clark said. ''Someone who lives on the water, unless he has separate flood insurance their normal policy won't pay for surge damage.'' But Dr. Leatherman said it is tough to walk away from an oceanfront home. ''It's just such high-value real estate,'' he said. ''And let's face it, people have gotten away with it for a long time now, haven't they?'' Say a hurricane mimics the 1938 storm and aims for Long Island. Is the region toast? While higher population and shoreline development might be the bad news, the good news is more sophisticated forecasting and stronger structures. ''Today, with our satellites, we look at these things very closely,'' Mr. Wyllie said. ''With Fabian, we were able to track its every move. We would have ample time to get people away. Question is, will they move?'' Move where? is the big question on the South Fork, which is notorious for the traffic jams along Route 27 on normal days, let alone emergency evacuations. ''I find it interesting and humorous sometimes that we have coastal road evacuation signs when there's only one road off the South Fork,'' Mr. Suskind said. But Mr. Wyllie said that residents of the East End would not have to leave the area altogether to be safe. ''We've done a lot of work with Suffolk County emergency managers, and I'm pretty comfortable that they would be very proactive in getting word out and moving people,'' he said. ''We're able to predict by combining various factors how high the wall of water will be on the shoreline when a hurricane makes landfall. Unfortunately, on Long Island it's really high, one of the highest in the country.'' He explained that Long Island, jutting out from the Eastern Seaboard, tends to trap and intensify the surge from any storm moving up the coast. The laser-mapping project may well help in this regard too. ''The maps we have are very much outdated, and we don't really know the flood zones very well,'' Dr. Leatherman said. ''We can't pinpoint what areas of the Hamptons will be safer than others, other than, obviously, the higher ground, where you're more vulnerable to wind damage. People in waterfront and low-lying areas have to run from the storm surge, then see what's left the next day. From the Hamptons in general, there isn't a way out because it's just going to be panicked people sitting in motionless cars as two-by-fours are being tossed into their windows by the wind. But we can find the areas people will be best protected.'' Mr. Suskind said that because of stronger guidelines from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the building and rebuilding being done on the South Shore is much sturdier and storm-resistant than it was years ago. ''As a homeowner here, you can't escape a hurricane,'' he said. ''What you can do by following the FEMA regulations is increase the chance of withstanding a storm and decrease the risk of damage.'' Whatever the benefits of better forecasting, better-built structures and preparedness, a hurricane as powerful as the one in 1938 would have a highly destructive impact. Last September, the weekly Southampton Press published a three-part series of articles on the impact on the East End of a hypothetical Hurricane Emily following the same track as the 1938 storm. The articles were based on FEMA and National Hurricane Center scenarios of a Category 3 storm, not the strongest but probably the most powerful likely to make it this far north. By the time the fictional storm had moved on, fewer than 30 percent of the homes on the South Shore from Moriches Bay to Amagansett remained. With this possible scenario in mind, Mr. Wyllie has attended as many as 70 town meetings around Long Island to promote hurricane preparedness and the need for evacuation plans, and to counsel people to have realistic expectations. ''We're certainly not ready for such a storm,'' Mr. Wyllie said. ''But we can save lives; that's the top priority. Property damage? Forget about it, that's gone.'' Long Island"
"Even more than usual, people here are talking about power: who lost it, how they fared without it, how long it took them to get it back. The chatter this time, though, concerns not influence but the simple ability to flick a light switch and have something happen. The mighty and the meek alike were without electricity -- some, in fact, still are -- after the edges of Hurricane Isabel swept through the Washington area last week. The wind gusts toppled countless trees throughout the city and its Virginia and Maryland suburbs, turning power lines to spaghetti and putting out the lights in fashionable Chevy Chase, Md.,; McLean, Va.; Georgetown; and many other locales. The situation invited jokes, as when L. Paul Bremer III, the civilian administrator in Iraq, was greeted by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday at a hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee. ''Welcome, Mr. Ambassador,'' Mr. Biden said. ''You're probably anxious to get back to Iraq.'' ''Well,'' Mr. Bremer replied with a laugh, ''I have a better electricity supply in Iraq, senator.'' The world may never know how many people who are used to shaping events and having their voices heard had to dine by candle and flashlight, like hundreds of thousands of others who are -- dare it be said? -- less well connected. For the record, the Washington homes of the Senate majority and minority leaders, Bill Frist and Tom Daschle, were without power for days. So were the Maryland homes of Tom Ridge, secretary of homeland security, and the former Pentagon official Richard N. Perle, a member of the Defense Policy Board, a team that serves as unpaid advisers to the defense secretary. So, no doubt, were the homes of some other members of the cabinet and Congress and various commentators and lobbyists. J. Dennis Hastert, speaker of the House, and Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, were home in Illinois and California, respectively, so they missed out on the blackout. So, apparently, did the nine Supreme Court justices, whose off-season coincides with the hurricane season. Tammy Haddad, a producer at MSNBC, says she sensed at a party this week how the blackout had turned things upside down. ''The party was divided between those who lost power and those who didn't,'' Ms. Haddad, whose house near Georgetown now has its electricity back, recalled today. In fact, she said, ''all of life is divided into that now.'' Howard Kurtz, media writer for The Washington Post, was at the party. ''He lost power,'' Ms. Haddad said, ''so I talked to him.'' The conservative commentator and sometime presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan was at the party, too. ''He lost his power for four days,'' Ms. Haddad said. ''I could talk to him.'' Ms. Haddad endured a special hardship. She played herself in a recently filmed episode of ''K Street,'' the HBO series about Washington lobbyists. But as the Sunday night telecast drew near, she still did not have power back. A shopping expedition for a battery-powered television set was unsuccessful. ''So I couldn't watch it,'' she said, her voice wistful with hopes of reruns. The blackout did bring a consolation prize for Ms. Haddad. Still without power on Monday night, she went to the home of the Democratic consultant Robert Shrum, who had electricity. She not only did her laundry there but also had a pleasant dinner with Mr. Shrum and another visitor, former Senator George S. McGovern, the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee. Another familiar figure of yesteryear, Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary to President Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush, did without electricity at his home in Deale, Md., southeast of Washington, but helped some total strangers who were guests of his neighbors and who found themselves without lodging after a wedding. ''We sat them down in the living room,'' Mr. Fitzwater said, ''gave them each a flashlight and briefed them on how to flush the toilet with a bucket of water from the Chesapeake Bay.'' ''Good night,'' Mr. Fitzwater then told them, ''and good luck.'' Washington Talk"
"GERRY MOOHR and her husband, Roger Sherman, spent just one weekend in their new vacation house near the Chesapeake Bay before Hurricane Isabel came barreling up the East Coast last week. So when the storm hit, the couple could do little more than sit at home in Lexington, Va., watch the Weather Channel and worry. ''We were thinking we were going to lose the whole house,'' said Ms. Moohr, a professor at Washington and Lee University's law school. Through much of North Carolina, Virginia and the Middle Atlantic states, residents spent the last week cleaning up yards and waiting for the lights to come back on, but at least they knew firsthand just how much damage they faced. But for many second-home owners, it was a week of worrying from afar. And while the well-prepared had arranged for property managers or contractors to deal with the aftermath, others were left to rely on real estate agents, the local chamber of commerce or the neighbors for help. ''A lot of people weren't prepared,'' said Tom Kimmitt, a real estate agent in Wicomico Church, Va., near the Chesapeake Bay. Technology has made it easier to keep informed. Owners of second homes in Nags Head, N.C., could call up the town's Web site and check if their houses had been damaged (though they had to have their parcel ID number handy). Many property managers shot digital photographs of clients' homes within 24 hours, but with phone and electric lines down, they had no way to send them. ''The pictures are more to assist the owner with any insurance claims,'' said Will Graham, an owner of Corolla (N.C.) Classic Vacations on the Outer Banks, which charges 20 percent to 22 percent of the annual rent for full-service management. But even the most dedicated property management company can face roadblocks -- literally. For five days after the storm, parts of South Nags Head were sealed off to anyone but homeowners, frustrating Richard Hess of Sun Realty, which manages some 1,600 properties on the Outer Banks. ''We are the eyes and ears of the owners,'' he said. Just ask Bruce Baschuk, who had signed up Mr. Graham's company to take care of his rental home in Corolla. Two days before the hurricane hit, the company checked his windows, brought all his pool furniture inside and turned off the electricity. Mr. Baschuk's primary home in Chevy Chase, Md., was left with no power and the yard looks like a swamp, he said, but his house in Corolla was relatively unscathed, and the property manager offered to line up a contractor to make the repairs. Owners without full-service property managers may find it hard to locate anyone to do the work. Joanne Lemley, who is retired and lives in Doylestown, Pa., rents out her house near the ocean in Salvo, N.C., through a real estate agency but decided not to shell out for extra disaster services. Her agent could not get to the house for four days, and when he did, he found that a large window had been blown out, leaving everything inside soaked. Now it may take months to get the repairs done. ''They say, 'Bring your own contractor,' '' Ms. Lemley said. Making things worse, unlike primary-home owners, who can get low-interest loans for everything from short-term housing to appliances through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, vacation-home owners are not eligible for assistance. In the end, no matter how good the property manager may be, most vacation-home owners want to see the damage for themselves. That's what Ms. Moohr and Mr. Sherman did, spending five and a half hours on the road, including two just waiting for gas, to check on their place. They arrived to find some downed trees and a waterlogged boat but little other damage, thanks to their new neighbor who secured the boat and stowed some outdoor furniture. ''I've got to buy him a lot of wine,'' Ms. Moohr said. ''At least a case.'' HAVENS"
"What Floyd Bullock will remember most are the two coffins he saw today floating toward the woods behind Oak Grove Church. As he slogged through chest-deep water to rescue people stranded by flash floods during Hurricane Isabel, Mr. Bullock, a volunteer firefighter, also saw mobile homes washed off their foundations, antique furniture swept out of homes and a family of five seeking refuge in their attic as the water rose. He saw a road overtaken by rain-swollen tributaries of the Neuse River, with at least 20 homes badly flooded and more than 100 people looking for a way out at the last minute. ''A bunch of houses pretty much lost everything,'' Mr. Bullock said tonight, winding down at the firehouse here with a few dozen other rescue workers. ''I've been through five hurricanes, but this is the first time I've seen houses destroyed.'' By the time Mr. Bullock and other rescuers reached the family in their attic, around 1 p.m., the flooding had eased a bit and the people chose to stay put. The Craven County Sheriff's Department used a five-ton truck to evacuate others to a nearby high school, where they would spend the night. Harlowe is about 60 miles southwest of Cape Hatteras. Many of the affected residents, along Adams Creek Road here, were retirees who had moved to houses along the Neuse from other parts of the state, Mr. Bullock said. The water was six feet deep in some spots, and only ankle high in others, he said. Adams Creek Road winds between two tributaries of the Neuse, which flows into the Pamlico Sound toward the Outer Banks. As the rain slowed late this afternoon, Mr. Bullock saw two boys on their bikes, plowing through waist-deep water. They had heard about the coffins and wanted to see them. ''It was bad,'' he said. Still Getting Supplies A few miles north, in New Bern, Vicki Minor left the Piggly Wiggly with cookies, chicken and a tub of lard, -- and she made one of the healthier purchases. As Hurricane Isabel chugged toward this coastal city this morning, Ms. Minor and dozens of other residents braved the squalling rain for last-minute provisions, offering a glimpse into the odd cravings of storm witnesses. The people of New Bern, on the Neuse River, had been preparing for the storm for days, so certain staples were long gone. The shelves had been emptied of black-cherry soda and white bread, Vienna sausages and vanilla wafers. Eggs, meat, fresh vegetables, dairy products and even bottled water were still in plentiful supply, but the Piggly Wiggly was running dangerously low on Cheese Doodles, beer, barbecue potato chips and snack-packs of pudding. ''All people want is munchies,'' said Danny Creel, the store supervisor, who had planned to keep the store closed today but opened it when he drove by and saw a crowd waiting, hopefully, at 8 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Creel rang up a purchase of Gummy Worms, Candy Corn, Twinkies, two kinds of chocolate bars and Malted Milk Balls. Willie Newkirk, who owns a used-car dealership on the highway into town, emerged from the store with bananas, beans and hot sauce, which he said he hoped would give him energy. He lost freezers full of food in two previous hurricanes, Mr. Newkirk said, so this time he had a generator ready. He could only hope that the 18 cars on his lot would not get flooded. ''It's a thing of nature, there's nothing I can do about it,'' Mr. Newkirk said. ''If I die, I just hope they'll keep me in the funeral home a few days so they can bury me dry.'' Boredom at a Hotel By lunchtime, rain had infiltrated the Sheraton Grand, New Bern's largest hotel, where 186 displaced homeowners, storm chasers, insurance claim adjusters and others awaited the worst. As the storm screeched, 20 garbage cans and several dozen towels collected water in the lobby while Steven King, the hotel manager, wondered how he had failed to predict the indoor downpour. ''We said, 'Make sure the generator has enough fuel' and 'Make sure the kitchen has enough stuff to eat,' '' Mr. King said as stir-crazy guests snapped pictures of the steady drips and spurts. ''But we never thought to say, 'Make sure the trash cans are ready for leaks.' '' For better or worse, the leaks were about the most exciting thing to witness here this afternoon. As Isabel's eye passed almost directly through this town, just northwest of Cape Hatteras, the talk might as well have been of a bowling professional who had just thrown a frightful gutter ball. The electricity flickered, but stayed on after an hour-long morning blackout. The wind gusts sometimes reached 60 miles per hour, but trees and windows remained intact. Mr. King and Dave Clark, who sought refuge here while sailing to Cocoa, Fla., traded anecdotes about fiercer hurricanes they had known: George and Andrew, Fran and Floyd. ''If you start seeing tree limbs flying by and dog houses rolling down the street, that's a hurricane,'' said Mr. King, who appeared strikingly unfazed by the rain soaking his ceiling and carpet. ''With Floyd the water came right up over the seawall, into one of our buildings.'' Mr. Clark, who said his wife was sleeping because they had shared a bottle of wine for lunch, was mildly concerned about his 36-foot houseboat, which he had left at a nearby marina after taping up the windows and putting out two anchors. Mr. Clark and other boaters were wandering the hotel in a pack, all topsiders and polo shirts and eager speculation about when they could set sail again. Then Mr. Clark's wife came down, rubbing her eyes and bearing bad news: The marina had called to say the boat was dragging in the four-foot storm surge. Mr. Clark charged out into the waning storm; at last, something to do. THE HURRICANE HITS: COPING"
"President Bush sought higher ground, leaving the White House for Camp David a day earlier than planned. Air Force One was moved to a safe spot in Georgia. The Senate opened for business, just long enough to pass a resolution honoring the late country singer Johnny Cash, then adjourned at 11:10 a.m. Lynne Cheney, the wife of the vice president, canceled the party for her new children's book. Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state, scrubbed the party for her new memoir. Schools were closed, though rain did not start falling and the winds did not pick up until late afternoon. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell canceled his trip to Stockholm for the funeral of Anna Lindh, the Swedish foreign minister who was killed last week. Federal offices were closed to all but essential employees. Even before a drop of rain had fallen, the Metro, the city's subway system, shut down entirely, for the first time in its 27-year history. Washington has long had a reputation as wimp town when it comes to weather. So when Hurricane Isabel began bearing down on the East Coast earlier this week, it was no surprise that this city's power brokers decided to close shop early, in deference to the most powerful force of all: nature. ''It is big, it is ugly,'' Mayor Anthony Williams told reporters this morning. ''It is a bad storm, and it is heading our way.'' Mr. Williams declared a state of emergency on Wednesday -- a full day before the storm's arrival. By this evening his fears appeared to have come to pass as a furious wind blew and a heavy rain began to pound the empty sidewalks of Washington, downing trees and power lines. By 11 p.m., the worst of the storm was headed west, having skirted the city. Even so, more than a third of the electric customers in Washington and its suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, an estimated 560,000 households, lacked power. At rush hour this evening, Interstate 66, a major highway connecting Washington to its Northern Virginia suburbs, was virtually empty of its usual bumper-to-bumper traffic. In Fairfax County, Va., the police evacuated roughly 2,500 people near the Potomac River. Earlier in the afternoon, garage attendants downtown, in a hurry to close up and get home, hustled the last cars to their few remaining customers. On M Street, in the Georgetown shopping district, stores were closed and some had been boarded up. Union Station, the city's hub for train travel, was empty of its usual midday bustle. Amtrak canceled service south of Washington, and cut back on its northeast corridor trains. A weary spokeswoman for Dr. Albright fielded calls from the city's disappointed intelligentsia, who were no longer welcome at the venerable Willard Hotel to celebrate the publication of ''Madam Secretary.'' ''We have had 400 calls from people who want a party,'' said the spokeswoman, Meridith Webster. ''But it's for the best. No one wants to trudge out in a hurricane.'' With the federal government all but shut down, there was little reason today for anyone in Washington to come to work. Most members of Congress left town on Wednesday evening for a long weekend, which put one of the city's largest industries, the lobbying trade, temporarily out of business. Special interests may have spent $1.8 billion on influence last year, but opportunities dwindle when no lawmakers are around. ''It's an absolute ghost town,'' complained Tommy Jacomo, general manager at the Palm restaurant, a favorite haunt of lawmakers and lobbyists. His usual lunch crowd of 150 was cut by two-thirds, he said. At PodestaMattoon, a lobbying shop home to one of Washington's best-known dealmakers, Anthony Podesta, a recorded phone message summed up the city's mood: ''Due to the inclement weather and the closing of the federal government, we are closed until further notice.'' Still, not everyone saw today as a day off. Bob Stevenson, the chief spokesman for Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, was holed up in his office, going through the e-mail messages he rarely has time to read. But the support staff -- the food service workers, secretaries and the other people who make the Capitol run -- had long ago gone home. ''We're in here working, but there's nothing to eat,'' Mr. Stevenson said. At the command center inside the Department of Health and Human Services, a skeleton crew, including military personnel and Red Cross workers, was monitoring the path of the storm into the night. ''We have some cots, some inflatable air mattresses,'' said Jerry Hauer, the department's chief of emergency preparedness, ''and we were able to get a block of hotel rooms, two blocks away.'' The White House, where workers had cleared drains and taken down awnings and flags, was virtually empty. President Bush had planned to leave today for Camp David, in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland, but instead left on Wednesday night. Aides scurried to rearrange his schedule, including a news conference with King Abdullah of Jordan, which had been planned for Friday but took place this morning. ''We wanted to get this over with,'' Mr. Bush told reporters at Camp David, ''so that you didn't have to float down the hill, if you know what I mean.'' The president then suggested that the news media do as official Washington had already done: ''Get going before it starts raining.'' THE HURRICANE HITS: THE CAPITAL"
"Fading but still fierce, Hurricane Isabel crashed ashore in North Carolina yesterday, swamped neighborhoods dozens of miles inland and raged north through Virginia to the nation's capital, with winds knocking out power to more than two million people and disrupting air travel across the mid-Atlantic region. At least eight deaths were attributed to the storm. The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm last night as its top sustained winds fell below 74 miles per hour. But early in the day, winds of 105 miles an hour snapped old oaks and pines like water-logged toothpicks on the Southern coast. On the Outer Banks in North Carolina, where the storm made landfall about 1 p.m., it sent Dumpsters floating past stranded trucks along the four-lane highway and parts of at least two hotels and several houses sliding into the wild sea. Though its strength was diminished from the 160-mile-an-hour winds recorded as it moved across the open ocean, the hurricane was still the strongest to hit the Atlantic Coast since Hurricane Floyd surged ashore in 1999. After plowing into the Outer Banks and the Tidewater region of Virginia, the storm turned north, thrashing Richmond and Washington with winds up to 72 m.p.h. and dumping up to 14 inches of rain in parts of Virginia. By nightfall winds of 43 m.p.h. were recorded in Philadelphia. New York and New Jersey were spared the worst of the storm yesterday. Officials at the Jersey Shore expected two to four inches of rain and were bracing for high tide today. [Page A23.] But the storm's greatest impact was in eastern North Carolina. By 9 last night, the roads of Kill Devil Hills in the Outer Banks were almost impenetrably black. The only light came from police cars that were enforcing a curfew until noon today to protect thrill seekers and the idly curious. Even before nightfall, visibility was no more than 100 yards, but people in pickups and even on foot kept venturing out to look at the beach road, Highway 12, which was a maelstrom of stinging sand and spray, flying two-by-fours and paint buckets, and hidden obstacles of nail-bearing roof and deck debris. ''I'm just watching the morons drive through this,'' said Fire Chief Doug Penland of Kill Devil Hills, idling in his four-by-four with another firefighter from a safe distance. Four people were killed in traffic accidents, and two men died after being struck by falling trees, The Associated Press reported this morning. The police in Nassau County said a man drowned at Long Beach yesterday afternoon. And in North Carolina, officials said an electrical worker was killed while trying to restore power. On Pea Island, N.C., three sheriff's deputies trying to rescue three people stranded on the roof of their stalled Chevy Blazer were stranded themselves by rising water, the Coast Guard said. And in Carteret County, three National Guard trucks rescued 130 people stranded in their houses. Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina asked President Bush to declare a federal disaster. The hurricane left wide swaths of territory powerless as falling trees caught electrical lines in bursts of blue-white light. Officials said 300,000 houses and businesses in North Carolina were without power, and the number reached 430,000 in Maryland, 78,000 in the District of Columbia, and 32,000 in New Jersey. But Virginia appeared to be hardest hit, with more than 1.4 million houses and businesses without power last night. About 92 percent of Dominion Virginia Power's customers in the eastern part of the state lost power yesterday, and Governor Mark Warner said that it would take several days for it to be restored. ''How many days depends on where you live,'' Governor Warner said. More 16,000 people were staying in 140 shelters across Virginia, most of them in the southeastern region. In Richmond, the highways were largely deserted last night. The few vehicles on the road had to swerve around scattered branches and deep pools of water. Nonworking traffic lights automatically became four-way stop signs as drivers made their way down flooded roads. From the Hampton Roads area, the Navy had sent 58 ships to ride out the storm at sea and moved 111 planes to safety as far as New Orleans and Tennessee. Governor Warner's news conference at the state police academy was disrupted when the power there failed. The governor spent much of the day in an emergency center inside a cold-war-era bomb shelter. In Virginia Beach alone, 100,000 homes and businesses were without power early yesterday, officials said. But the power failures also bled into the central and northern parts of the state, including Richmond, the capital. Officials warned that the power failures were likely to cause sewer systems to back up, and urged people to postpone showers, toilet flushing and clothes washing. In Washington, federal and district offices were ordered closed, and the governors of North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia declared states of emergency. Amtrak halted service south of Washington, and the subway and bus system in the capital area shut down around noon. Airline flights throughout the region were canceled and the Federal Aviation Administration closed its air traffic control tower in Norfolk, Va. All flights to and from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport were canceled after 4 p.m. yesterday, with more cancellations expected today. Dulles International Airport had also shut down, with the last flight leaving at 4:30 p.m., and all planes moved to other airports, said Tara Hamilton, an airport spokeswoman. Flights to and from Baltimore-Washington International Airport were canceled after 5:30 p.m. yesterday, with some arriving flights expected this morning. In the New York area, Newark Liberty International Airport had 15-minute delays on arriving and departing flights, John F. Kennedy International Airport had no delays, and La Guardia reported no outbound delays but up to two-hour delays for arriving flights. And Philadelphia International airport reported delays or cancellations for 20 percent of its departing flights and 14 percent of its arriving flights as of 8:15 p.m. Schools closed in North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia, and schools were also closing in West Virginia, The Associated Press said. On Chincoteague Island, Va., many of the more than 5,000 human residents have evacuated, but the island's famed wild ponies were left to seek higher ground on their own. ''They're in God's hands,'' said Ken Hardinson, a volunteer fireman. In Edenton, N.C., a historic village on Albemarle Sound, the storm's powerful winds wreaked havoc on the town's towering, century-old trees. One giant oak was torn from its roots in a graveyard, crushing tombstones beneath it. Felled trees blocked the main road in several places, as well as the entrances to the local high school that was serving as a shelter for 179 people. Pounding waves from the swollen Chowan River engulfed the town's new pier, indicating tidal flooding was on its way. At the shelter, Chris Shifflett, 61, said she and her husband had fled their home out of fears that one of their trees would crumple their roof. ''We have some big ones, and they would do some serious damage,'' she said. Along the Outer Banks the beach road was washed out in many places. In Kill Devil Hills, parts of the beachfront Sea Ranch Hotel had slid into the water, and a few residents said they had spotted furniture and office equipment floating through the hotel's windows. Even the four-lane bypass, Highway 158, which is on higher ground, was swamped over a foot deep when the hurricane made landfall just before high tide, about 1:30. Local officials reported scattered roof damage, electrical failures and downed power lines. On Roanoke Island, about 15 miles south of here, officials said a mobile home caught fire and was destroyed, and reported numerous tree felled trees and downed power lines. Just to the north in Kitty Hawk, a vehicle overturned when its driver got too close to the beach road, but no injuries were reported. Inside an open-air, drive-through car wash, Ron Anthony, 46, had taken refuge from the wind. He had ridden a motor scooter a few blocks from his home, trying to get to the beach, ''just to be able to say I did it,'' he said. ''I just couldn't make it. Too much wind -- you come to a stop and it'll blow you backwards. ''I've been here 10 years, and this is the worst I've seen,'' Mr. Anthony, the manager of a shrimp shack, said. THE HURRICANE HITS: LANDFALL"
"Stormy weather in advance of Hurricane Isabel wheeled into the New York region tonight, leaving at least 64,000 utility customers without power, mainly in southern parts of New Jersey. As the strong winds and spitting rain swept through New Jersey and New York City, upstate New York got ready to face the weakening storm. After coming ashore in North Carolina, it set course to travel up the foothills of the Appalachians and Alleghenies to western New York, which it is expected to reach early Friday. [On Long Island, a detective drowned in Long Beach about 6 p.m. Thursday, the police said. The detective, Patrick Bradley, 42, was a 15-year veteran of the Long Beach Police Department. [The Nassau County police reported that beaches at Jones Beach and Long Beach were closed to the public.] In New Jersey, with the region's most exposed shoreline to the wind and rain, Gov. James E. McGreevey declared a state of emergency. But he said the declaration was provisional, to let him mobilize the state National Guard's 2.5-ton trucks in case they are needed to rescue people stranded on the state's barrier islands. The power losses tonight were caused by downed utility lines, according to Conectiv and Jersey Central Power and Light. At the New Jersey State Police emergency center, Lt. Al DellaFave, the state police spokesman, said forecasters who had predicted three to five inches of rain for the state had revised their estimates downward by midafternoon, to two to four inches. ''For most of the state, things are going pretty well, but we're not expecting the worst of the storm until high tide early Friday,'' Lieutenant DellaFave said. ''We got through the first one this afternoon pretty well, and if we get through the next one, then there is definitely not going to be a problem.'' Up and down the region, the arrival of Isabel after a week's warning by forecasters was often attended by more curiosity than fear. Here at the southern tip of the state, where Cape May juts into the Atlantic, the beach roads were jammed with sightseers marveling at the breakers, measured by county officials at 10 to 15 feet in height. Boys played in the surf with stubby boogie boards, and a couple shot down the sidewalk on skateboards, propelled by bedsheets held out as sails. At Atlantic City, 47 miles up the coast from here, leaders from the Miss America pageant were putting a pretty face on the storm that has threatened, but not yet forced, the cancellation of Friday's traditional contestants' parade on the Boardwalk, which is scheduled for 6 p.m. ''It's on,'' said George Bauer, president and chief executive of the Miss America Organization. ''However, we are going to reassess at 8 a.m. Actually, I don't believe it's ever been canceled for weather.'' The weather did, however, delay flights at the region's major airports, and forced several schools to close early today and to contemplate closing Friday. Atlantic City's casinos reported some cancellations. Throughout the state, officials said that flooding was the principal danger from the storm, particularly since much of the ground was saturated with days of rain earlier in the week. Lenora Boninfante, communications director for Cape May County, said this afternoon that high waves and a slanting onshore wind had pushed seawater across oceanfront roads in Avalon. On most of the beaches, the waves drove pools of water up to the inland dunes, and Ms. Boninfante said that the afternoon high tide had come in four feet higher than expected, leading county engineers to expect at least some beach erosion. For most people the storm meant preparing for the worst and hoping for a break. In Brooklyn, Sal Argano, the general manager of the Seagate Beach Club, built a high wall of sandbags in front of the clubhouse. Sandbags were also deployed in Bound Brook, N.J., the town on the Raritan River whose business district was under eight feet of water when Tropical Storm Floyd fell on the region in 1999. ''I don't think it's going to be near as bad,'' said Federico A. Llaverias outside his business, the Spice of Life Café. Still, he filled 30 sandbags as a precaution. THE HURRICANE HITS: NEW JERSEY SHORE"
"The Agriculture Department has reversed itself to allow the biggest farms to receive compensation under a special program for Florida growers hurt by this year's hurricanes. The change has raised fears among small farmers that their share of the available aid will shrink. Most disaster relief programs for farmers limit eligibility to those with an adjusted gross income of up to $2.5 million or to those farmers who derive at least 75 percent of their income from farming, thus excluding large corporations. The policy change, however, made Oct. 8, separates crop loss from tree damage and cleanup costs, opening the doors to claims from big growers that would usually be ineligible for these payments. Crop loss payments are still subject to income limits and are capped at $80,000 per farmer, but there are no restrictions on compensation for tree damage and cleanup costs. Floyd Gaibler, a deputy under secretary of the Agriculture Department, said the decision to separate crop replacement payments from damage payments was made after negotiations with the industry because the department decided that the losses were so great. Four hurricanes hit the state this year. But advocates for small farmers expressed concern that the change in eligibility would let big farms and corporate farms take a large share of the approximately $500 million that the Agriculture Department has said is available for relief to Florida growers. Larry Mitchell, who administered similar programs when he was a Agriculture Department official and is now the chief executive of the American Corn Growers Association, which represents smaller farms, said this was the first time he could recall that the income provision had been waived. He said he feared that that by making large corporations eligible, assistance to everyone else would be decreased. ''It's a bit disturbing that the U.S.D.A. has made a decision to reallocate money from a finite number of dollars to a large corporation,'' Mr. Mitchell said in an interview. ''Therefore we're taking money out of the hip pockets of farm families.''"
"THE destructive rainstorms visited upon Westchester County over the last two months by four Florida hurricanes provide an uncomfortable reminder of Tropical Storm Floyd, which hit here five years ago, on Sept. 16, 1999. While New York City was largely spared the worst that night, nearly a foot of rain fell on the county within a 24-hour period. The result was severe, widespread damage, especially in northern areas, where the landscape was transmogrified by floating cars, downed trees, collapsed railroad embankments and impassable roadways. Some experts claimed at the time that a storm of such magnitude would be very unlikely to recur in New York for another 250 years. But judging from the recent weather, that prediction may have been a little rosy. In fact, according to Gary Conte, a warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Upton, N.Y.: ''The New York area experiences some impact from tropical storms every 4 years, and from hurricanes every 10 years.'' In the five years since Floyd, one of its few positive results is an improved county emergency service. When the storm hit in 1999, there was no major coordinating group, according to County Executive Andrew J. Spano. Each municipality had to deal with its own emergencies, he said, adding that the problem at the time forced him to rely for most of his storm information on Westchester's cable news channel. ''Floyd was a big lesson in what we needed to do to enhance emergency management in Westchester County,'' Mr. Spano said. Anthony W. Sutton, commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services, described the newly integrated group as putting ''fire and emergency medical services and emergency management under the same roof.'' ''I use the analogy of the wedding planner for emergency management,'' he added. ''We bring everything together and make things happen.'' Yet the other lessons to be learned in the county from what could be called ''Floyd 101'' are: a) that because of prohibitive cost, almost nothing gets rebuilt sturdily enough to withstand a comparable storm, and b) that no one -- whether private homeowner, business or municipality -- recovers 100 percent of a storm loss. Just about every city, town and village in Westchester County incurred some storm damage from Floyd, starting with minor amounts in Dobbs Ferry and ranging to more than $3 million in Peekskill and Ossining, according to a list compiled by Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency Management Office. Indeed, Westchester was one of 13 New York counties declared federal disaster areas, which enabled municipalities, businesses, and homeowners to become eligible for federal relief. Ultimately, Westchester municipalities were reimbursed about $14 million by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for damages; local businesses received $2.3 million from the agency, and homeowners got about $1.6 million, according to Barbara J. Ellis, a spokeswoman for the agency. It was the biggest chunk of federal disaster assistance provided to Westchester County since FEMA was founded about 25 years ago, Ms. Ellis said. In Cortlandt, the final check for a federal reimbursement of $886,000 arrived just this summer -- one of about 10 separate payments, said the town controller, Glenn Cestaro. In the recent spate of storms, however, Cortlandt was hit again, said Linda D. Puglisi, the town supervisor. Several of its major roadways were submerged. ''We have drainage issues,'' is how Ms. Puglisi described the problems, noting that post-Floyd improvements had not prevented flooding. Parts of Peekskill, which has a century-old infrastructure, still flood during rainstorms, although the areas repaired after Floyd have held so far, according to David Greener, director of city services. The city has received payments totaling $500,000, although it has been promised an additional $2 million by the emergency management agency. ''I've been approved, but I haven't seen the money yet,'' said Mr. Greener, adding, ''I don't want to jeopardize the money.'' Five years ago during Floyd, Mr. Greener took a video camera out in the rainstorm and taped the surging rainwater just as it buckled and collapsed more than 200 feet of Central Avenue. The site remained closed for two years, he said, with repair delays related to engineering problems. Today, the completed culvert under the repaired Central Avenue roadway is a giant rectangle 14 feet by 5 -- roomy enough for a short family to hold a tail-gate party inside. It was designed not to interfere with the electric lines, gas mains and sewer lines nearby. If Floyd happened again today, with a full moon and at high tide, Mr. Greener said, the new culvert would probably hold -- but the runoff it would spew into Water Street, which runs perpendicular to Central Avenue, wreaking havoc there. In Ossining, Floyd-related flooding was so dramatic that Gov. George E. Pataki, Senator Charles S. Schumer and other officials visited, turning the village into a sound bite site for local television news. Ultimately, Ossining incurred about $3.56 million in damages. It has been reimbursed for about $3.16 million of that, said Lynn M. McCrum, the village manager. The day Floyd hit, Mr. McCrum recalled, the normally tame Sparta and Kil Brooks flooded, and he watched in disbelief as a car, crushed and compacted by its trip downstream, floated toward the Hudson River. The lower Kil Brook, where the car eventually landed, exploded out of a large culvert and flooded the railroad tracks -- where, Mr. McCrum said, it shut down the Hudson Line of Metro-North. Despite extensive repairs at that site, he added, the water has risen nearly as high several times during the recent storms. Repairing Floyd's damage in Ossining required 54 separate projects, so detailed and complicated in nature that, Mr. McCrum said, he is still working on the FEMA applications five years later. The hurricane doled $2.8 million in losses out on Metro-North, from flooded tracks and washed-out embankments in Ossining, as well as in Golden's Bridge, Purdy's and Scarborough, said Marjorie Anders, a railroad spokeswoman. No amount of planning or preparation can prevent such problems, she said, but she did cite standard company procedures -- like getting chainsaws sharpened and fueled, and readying shuttle buses. Nearly all of the state-controlled parkways in Westchester flooded during Floyd, causing about $2.8 million in damage, said Robert A. Dennison, regional director of the New York State Department of Transportation. But then again, officials say, parkway flooding is so frequent that most county residents would be surprised if it didn't occur. Mr. Dennison, who says he is fatalistic about the problem, points out that the roadways' very names indicate why they are so susceptible: the Saw Mill River Parkway, the Hutchinson River Parkway, the Sprain Brook Parkway and the Taconic Parkway were all built on river channels. Because the roads are surrounded by heavy development, Mr. Dennison explained, they fill up like plugged bathtubs during storms. Little else can be expected of an area ''comprised of paving and roofs,'' he said. The way to fix the problem: divert all the extra water to empty land near the parkways -- which ''you could do in Idaho,'' Mr. Dennison concluded, ''but not here.'' Yet despite these inherent problems, infrastructure systems like highways have to function, and so are repaired after natural disasters. The same is not true of private businesses. Ms. Ellis, the FEMA spokeswoman, said that although her agency usually pays about 75 percent of the cost for municipal storm losses, it pays smaller, and varying, amounts for private business and individual losses. One of those individuals, Salvatore Credendino of Ossining, says his company, Highland Transmissions, has recovered less than 20 percent of the $3 million loss it suffered in Floyd. That night three years ago, surging storm waters sluiced through the property, turning two buildings into three. Today the damage is still glaring: one unrepaired structure on the site remains open to the elements -- a gaping maw with wires and cables dangling. Mr. Credendino, who says he still gets nervous every time it rains, recalled that in the middle of Floyd's onslaught he rushed to his site, a three-quarter-acre property that dips down from Route 9. The business is adjacent to the Kil Brook -- usually a small trickle of water that feeds into the Hudson. But he arrived to find the buildings enisled in about 12 feet of water. He saw equipment, tools and car parts floating by, along with a chunk of one building, which had collapsed into the filthy rising tide. ''I'm surprised we managed to pull through it,'' he said in a recent interview at the site, ''but we're still struggling.'' Among the uncounted Westchester homeowners who suffered losses in Floyd, fewer than 1 percent had flood insurance, according to information provided by the emergency management agency. That number, incidentally, remains about the same today -- partly because even the most deluxe homeowner's insurance policy does not cover storm-related flooding. That must be bought separately from the National Flood Insurance Program. In Peekskill that night, the torrent in storm drains sent manhole covers on neighborhood streets shooting into the air. Among the basements that became wading pools, or worse, there was one in Sleepy Hollow in which the water exploded up through a concrete floor. ''The water came up through the slop sink and it geysered through the concrete floor like Yellowstone,'' said the homeowner, explaining that she did not want to be identified because other people now live in the house. By the end of the day, the family's basement was filled nearly to the ceiling. They had to replace the washer, the dryer and the boiler, not to mention the floor, she said, and they also waterproofed the basement -- which has nevertheless flooded several times since. Elsewhere in Sleepy Hollow that night, recalled Lawrence P. Doyle, a resident, he helped neighbors bail out the lower level of their home, where two sump pumps working at full speed were being outpaced by the storm. After moving the washing machine's hose from the sink to the window, Mr. Doyle bailed water into the machine and set it on spin cycle. The extra water spewed into the back yard. At another home, he said, he remembers building a channel out of area rugs, so water flowing in at the front door could be diverted out the back. The situation was little better at Philipsburg Manor, a historic edifice in Sleepy Hollow, which suffered $4.1 million in damage, according to Waddell W. Spillman, president of Historic Hudson Valley in Tarrytown. He remembers watching the property's historic mill bridge as it was hit by a flow of gardening equipment, barbecue grills, parts of swing sets and other debris borne forward on the turbulent Pocantico River. The detritus ended up building a makeshift dam that diverted the river water onto the grounds. ''All of this junk came down the Pocantico River and wedged up at the bridge,'' said Mr. Spillman, adding that the ensuing flood undermined the foundation of both the reconstructed mill and the Manor House, which was built in 1693. State and federal emergency funds paid $2.1 million toward the renovations, along with an additional $1.5 million in grants, and the rest in private donations, according to a spokeswoman, Rachel Carr. ''The day of the flood,'' Mr. Spillman said, ''we went through stages of grief, beginning with total shock. Later, we were equally stunned by dozens of people who materialized from the neighborhood and community to help out.'' Two ponds on the site have since been dredged, Mr. Spillman said, although the work is not yet finished. In addition, concrete walls were built underground to protect the buildings' foundations. ''We hope to leave things in better shape for the next Floyd,'' he said. That may be about the best Westchester can hope for, said Mr. Dennison of the Transportation Department, emphasizing the near-impossibility of achieving true protection. ''Is it a prudent investment of public money to solve something that might happen two times in 250 years?'' he asked. ''The money is more well spent fixing something that will probably happen more frequently.'' He did acknowledge, however, that fast and easy repairs can sometimes hold their own dangers. ''Everybody has a tendency to do the quick fix,'' he said, adding, ''We have to keep local government focused on doing permanent repairs.'' Meteorology Fans, Take Note THE last six weeks were particularly Floydlike, according to Jerome S. Thaler, a weather buff who volunteers for the National Weather Service. September 2004 was the fifth-wettest month in Westchester since 1860, said Mr. Thaler, who has run the weather station in Yorktown Heights for 40 years. The county got 13.25 inches of rain last month, about the same amount as September 1999, which registered 13.6 inches, he said. As for the day that Hurricane Floyd struck Westchester County -- after it had been downgraded to a tropical storm -- Mr. Thaler calls it ''the single wettest day on record.'' The county got 11 inches of rain during that 24-hour period, he said, although in some areas it may have been closer to 15 or 17 inches. Weather records do vary, though, depending on one's location in Westchester County, as the area includes two distinct climate regions. The National Weather Service describes the southern part of the county -- everything below Interstate 287 -- as being in the coastal climate zone, which includes New York City and Long Island. The northern part of Westchester, above Interstate 287, belongs to the large Hudson Valley climate zone, which includes Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, Columbia, Saratoga and Rensselaer Counties, as well as parts of seven others. On weather issues, Mr. Thaler considers Interstate 287 ''the waistline'' bisecting Westchester's 450 square miles. The hottest day in Westchester County, as recorded at the Westchester County Airport, was 102 degrees Fahrenheit, on July 4, 1966, according to records provided by the Northeast Regional Climate Center. The coldest day: Feb. 11, 1979, when the thermometer dipped to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. But those numbers only go back to 1948, when the airport opened. Westchester"
"The House approved $11.6 billion in emergency aid on Saturday for the storm-battered and politically important state of Florida as Congress worked through a stack of must-pass legislation before lawmakers hit the campaign trail. After a last-second maneuver, House members agreed to the emergency spending that Florida lawmakers said was desperately needed to help the state recover from its streak of four hurricanes. The vote was 374 to 0. ''On behalf of the residents of Florida and all of those who have been made homeless or lost substantial property due to the hurricane, I want to express my appreciation,'' Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican, told his House colleagues as they gathered for one of their infrequent weekend meetings. The money will go to Florida and other Southeastern and mid-Atlantic states that suffered storm losses, with the bulk of it -- $6.5 billion -- designated for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which lawmakers said is running dangerously short of money. It comes on top of $2 billion hastily approved by Congress after the first storm hit. At the same time, lawmakers consented to about $2.8 billion in farm aid for drought-stricken farmers around the nation, relief that Western and Midwestern lawmakers said was as badly needed as the hurricane money. But that farm help was offset by cuts in spending on other farm programs, a decision that helped slow the bill and forced lawmakers who were eager to recess to remain in the Capitol over the weekend. In the Senate, lawmakers gave final approval on a 79-to-6 vote to a reorganization of the way senators oversee American intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security, taking action recommended by the independent commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks. The Senate leadership deputies that drafted the reorganization, the Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Harry Reid of Nevada, described the changes as the most significant Senate structural overhaul in 30 years. The new rules are intended to enhance the power and expertise of the Intelligence Committee and gives major responsibility for domestic security activities to what is now the Governmental Affairs Committee. The changes do not go as far as the commission proposed on empowering the intelligence panel. But the lawmakers said that they had to overcome ''grousing'' from senior lawmakers who lost power to win the changes and that the Sept. 11 commission members seemed generally satisfied. ''They understand we can't wave a magical wand and do everything they wanted,'' Mr. Reid said. Before leaving town, House members also adopted a $32 billion spending plan for the Homeland Security Department. Both the House and Senate approved a major Pentagon policy measure prohibiting a disputed program to lease refueling tankers from Boeing. They also sent to President Bush a measure increasing resources to provide DNA testing in rape cases. Senators still need to act on the disaster aid and Homeland Security measures and a major corporate tax bill before recessing. Senators still need to dispose of the disaster aid and a major corporate tax bill before recessing. A bipartisan group of senators was opposed to the tax measure that has already passed the House and was virtually certain of Senate adoption. But the critics intended to exercise their opportunity to challenge it on the floor before allowing a final vote."
"I live two lives, one in north Florida and one in central Florida; in two homes with friends from two regions who, until now, would barely admit they shared the same state. I teach amid citrus groves, Disney-inspired sprawl, Interstate 4 traffic and bass-rich lakes. Central Floridians here who invoke the word ''home'' often mean where they came from: New York, Boston, Cleveland, places where time is measured by the orderly passage of four distinct seasons. In my other life on the Panhandle at Alligator Point, I write novels in a coastal shack that was built by the Army in 1943, and look out at the Gulf of Mexico and Alligator Bay. Sand dunes, sea oats and rattlesnakes flourish on the faint rise of sand. I've gone six days and not seen anyone but the mail lady. Fifth-generation Floridians are the norm. On Aug. 13 while I was alone in my sea shanty, Florida experienced a milestone. Not since 1906 had two tropical systems hit the same state within 24 hours. As Tropical Storm Bonnie barreled ashore, I monitored the Weather Channel to divine Hurricane Charley's path. Friends urged me to head back to Winter Park where, they said, I'd be safe. As I watched the radar images of Charley, Bonnie blew out my kitchen window. For me, that was the beginning of feeling under siege, of gaining a new understanding of nature's wrath, of tossing off half-frantic jokes that the next storm would be named Job and our new motto was ''Welcome to Florida, Land of Natural and Political Disasters.'' By now, Floridians know the facts by heart. Between Aug. 13 and Sept. 24, in a season that doesn't end until Dec. 1, we took direct hits by five tropical systems, four of them major hurricanes. We know the numbers and we're living the horror, but we can't grasp the reasons. We've lived for weeks without electricity in boarded-up houses in 90-degree heat. We've driven through the night in search of gasoline. We've become refugees, evacuating to inland towns previously perceived as safe ports. We've gone to grocery stores only to find empty shelves. We've set out from our homes and suddenly halted, unsure of where we were because all the familiar markers -- mainly ancient oaks -- were gone, our abundant landscape blown bare. We've experienced money rationing as harried bank tellers warned that no one knew when more cash would arrive. We've endured 72-hour curfews. We've been told to replenish our hurricane supplies because the unthinkable was happening -- another strike by another storm -- but we couldn't get to the stores because our streets were impassable. We've been told we can't go home. Strangers with running water have offered their showers to those without. Firefighters and neighbors cut swaths through towering walls of debris to free people trapped inside their houses. Many of us have lost our homes; some of us have lost loved ones. I've huddled in my hallway in Winter Park because hurricane-spawned tornadoes were nearby, while at that exact moment my house 200 miles to the north was being hammered by the same storm. At Rollins College where I teach, our on-campus students have been evacuated from their dorms three times within a month. The college has provided shelter, safety and meals without electricity, even boiling water to drink. Each time, our new president Lewis Duncan, who had arrived from Dartmouth 13 days before the first storm, and his family dragged their sleeping bags into the shelter. We are all shell-shocked. The semester that began late thanks to Charley has been blown to smithereens by subsequent storms and class cancellations. Imagine being repeatedly evacuated to Bush Science Center -- built to withstand nuclear attack -- without knowing when you will be allowed to leave and if there will be anything to go home to. Steve Neilson, dean of student affairs, has warned that the students are experiencing something akin to post-traumatic stress syndrome. The morning after Hurricane Charley, staff members -- some of whom had lost their homes -- made their way through dangerous streets to the campus to begin pulling us back to what we had so thoroughly lost: a sense of normalcy. When it was announced that the college would be closed for the second time in three weeks because of an impending strike by Hurricane Frances, I sent my students an e-mail message, coaching them to step into their writers' skin: ''Watch everything. Remember everything. Write it all down. You are the recorders of our time.'' Then came two more storms, Ivan and Jeanne, but I didn't send any messages. I'd lost the ability to comfort or lead. And in the aftermath of our fourth hurricane, I decided I didn't know how to teach. Two days after Jeanne swept through last week, I walked into the classroom, and to my surprise a cheer broke out. My students weren't lauding me but the possibility that life might return to normal. I looked at them and thought, we can't pretend we are the same class that first gathered a month ago. ''I have a suggestion,'' I said. ''What if we pretend that today is the first day of the semester? Any work you've done that is solid, you'll get credit for. Any work that is below our standards? We'll wipe the slate clean and start over. '' My offer was met with silence. Finally, someone asked, ''Really?'' ''Really.'' The class, save for one student, erupted into a spontaneous celebration. ''Is this not O.K. for you?'' I asked. ''No, no,'' the student said. ''It's just -- this is the kindest thing anyone has ever offered me.'' Several of us blinked back tears. And then we moved on. The geographic, sociological, political and economic schisms that so often define Florida have lost some of their punch this hurricane season. The regional squabbling and name-calling seem downright absurd. Frankly, I'm proud of us. We've behaved patiently, exhibiting generosity to both neighbors and strangers. We've accepted what nature has wrought with quiet determination and, yes, reasonable disbelief. We're not perfect; price-gougers walk among us. But today folks in Punta Gorda to the west, Stuart to the east and Pensacola to the north grieve with one voice. We feel embattled, cursed, ravaged. Yet, still, we know we'll return to normal. It won't be the same normal that existed before Aug. 13. It will be better. Perhaps this is simply my attempt to impose meaning on chaos, but I believe that because of our common experience with this hurricane season from hell, Floridians from tip to stern are finally thinking of themselves as one people and this wild land as home.

"From Trinidad to Tallahassee, Fla., tropical storms have ravaged the Caribbean basin, exacting a multibillion-dollar toll on housing, schools, hospitals, roads and sewage systems. Most of the casualties were in Haiti. But almost no community escaped unscathed. In Grenada, half of the population is now homeless, the famed nutmeg groves flattened, the power plants wrecked. The tourism industry that was the island's lifeblood could take years to recover. Many other islands -- including Tobago, Jamaica and Grand Cayman -- also suffered. The biggest killer in natural disasters is poverty. The same hurricane tides that flood houses in Florida sweep away entire neighborhoods in places like Gonaïves, Haiti. And while survivors need places to live, simply rebuilding their tin-roofed shacks in flood plains guarantees they will suffer again. Better planning, and more focused foreign aid, can help even poor nations reduce the loss of life and property from natural disasters. Compare the consequences of the storms in the two countries that share the island of Hispaniola. In the Dominican Republic, which has invested in hurricane shelters and emergency evacuation networks, the death toll was fewer than 10, as compared to an estimated 2,000 in Haiti. And Cuba's proven ability to survive hurricanes with few casualties -- Ivan claimed no lives there because two million people were swiftly moved out of harm's way -- is a testament both to the value of disaster response planning and the need for it throughout the Caribbean. According to climatologists, vulnerable coastal communities should be prepared for greater erosion and more severe floods in the future. Poor countries need help to rebuild and to better protect themselves against future such calamities. The United Nations is now beginning appeals for emergency humanitarian aid for Grenada and Haiti to provide food, temporary shelter and basic health care. But long-term development assistance in the Caribbean from agencies like mine, as well as from donors like the United States, must focus on reducing the destructive impact of these storms. Virtually every school, road, hospital or housing settlement destroyed in Grenada by Hurricane Ivan or in Haiti by Hurricane Jeanne was financed with foreign assistance. Reconstruction often occurs with such haste that countries end up with even greater exposure to future hurricanes. But housing developments can be sited and designed to avoid the worst damage. In an effort to promote better long-term planning, the United Nations Development Program early this year evaluated disaster preparedness in scores of nations. It showed Haitians were 100 times more likely to die in an equivalent storm than Dominicans. In the storms that hit last week in Gonaïves, flash floods occurred in just a few hours because upstream terrain has long since been stripped of forests and topsoil. The magnitude of the destruction in Haiti and Grenada underscores the need for vulnerable island states to develop policies that will enable them to withstand these storms. And from the international development community, they deserve not just more aid, but smarter aid. Op-Ed Contributor Julia Taft is assistant administrator of the United Nations Development Program."
"DERMOT CONNOLLY had every reason to be thankful when Hurricane Ivan suddenly turned and passed south of Jamaica in mid-September. Although buffeted by 100-mile-an-hour gusts, Wyndham Rose Hall Resort, where Mr. Connolly is general manager, sustained minor damage and was cleaned up in a few days. But Ivan left one lasting effect, Mr. Connolly said. Would-be guests canceled, failed to show up or simply didn't bother booking. ''Our challenge is to convince customers that we are back to normal,'' he said. As an incentive, Wyndham, (800) 996-3426, www.wyndham.com, cut rates at Rose Hall for a standard room to $108 a night from $120 until the end of the year for bookings on its Web site. Mr. Connolly is not the only one with deals. Across the Caribbean, hoteliers, while relieved that their properties came through storms unscathed, have too many empty rooms. ''Fall is generally bargain hunting time in the Caribbean,'' said Hugh Riley, director of marketing for the Americas at the Caribbean Tourism Organization. ''But this year's particularly active hurricane season has spawned a much larger number of deals than usual.'' The group's site, www.doitcaribbean.com, lists about 65 specials. Although widespread storm damage to travel infrastructure was restricted to Grenada, Grand Bahama and Grand Cayman, checks on Web sites and interviews with resort managers and tourism officials in mid-October uncovered bargains on nearly every island. ''Our hotels are offering some of the best deals I've ever seen to make consumers aware that they are open for business,'' said Vernice Walkine, deputy director general, Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. She said that the impression that the Bahamas were devastated was wrong, noting that out of more than 700 islands, only resorts on Grand Bahama and Abaco had significant damage. Deals are at www.bahamas.com. The Sheraton at Our Lucaya Beach and Golf Resort, (877) 687-5822, www.ourlucaya.com, on Grand Bahama Island, which closed after Hurricane Frances hit on Sept. 4 but reopened in mid-October, is wooing customers back with standard rooms discounted by 25 percent to $109 a night through Dec. 23. The Westin at Our Lucaya Beach remains closed. The Pelican Bay Suites, (800) 852-3702, on the Web at www.pelicanbayhotel.com, also on Grand Bahama, provides a free fourth night until Dec. 19. The daily rate is $220; book by Nov. 30. Bargains on Nassau On Nassau, which received only cosmetic storm damage, according to Ms. Walkine, all-inclusive Sandals Royal Bahamian Spa Resort, (888) 726-3257, www.sandals.com, which was closed briefly after Hurricane Frances, has cut its rates 40 percent. They begin at $375 a night, double occupancy, for stays of three nights or more. Book by Nov. 10. The exclusive One&Only Ocean Club, (800) 321-3000 or www.oneandonlyoceanclub.com, where nightly rates start at $450 (meals extra), adds a fourth night free through Nov. 17. Good deals can also be found in the Out Islands. Romora Bay Club, (800) 688-0425, www.romorabay.com, on Harbour Island, which had minimal damage from Frances, according to the Bahamian government, is also giving a free fourth night through Dec. 18. Rates begin at $370 a night, double, with breakfast and dinner. After minor damage, Palm Bay Beach Club, (888) 396-0606, www.palmbaybeachclub.com, on Great Exuma cut rates an extra 20 percent through Nov. 30. Studio cottages begin at $108. Even resorts on islands that were completely skirted by bad weather have been forced to cut rates. ''We were totally missed by all the hurricanes that passed through this year,'' said Vaden Jones, general manager of Oualie Beach Resort on Nevis; (869) 469-9735 or www.oualiebeach.com. Nonetheless, Mr. Jones introduced a Tropical Storm Buster package. Through Nov. 30, he has cut rates to $210 a night, with breakfast and dinner, based on double occupancy and a minimum stay of five days; the usual rate is $305. On St. Kitts, Frigate Bay Resort, (800) 266-2185, www.frigatebay.com, has rooms from $60 a night until Dec. 19 (25 percent below regular rates) for stays of at least five nights. Through Dec. 23, Wyndham has a package with nightly rates of $99 a person with unlimited golf at its El Conquistador in Puerto Rico, a 40 percent discount, said Kathleen Casper, a public relations director with the company. Wyndham's Martineau Bay Resort and Spa on Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico, is selling rooms for $150 a night, including breakfast each day and one free massage -- a saving of 50 percent. Both deals require a minimum three-night stay. Ms. Casper said the deals came in response to the hurricanes, which did not damage the properties. Following the storms, member hotels of the Turks and Caicos Hotel and Tourism Association banded together on specials ranging from free-night deals to across-the-board discounts of up to 25 percent, good until the period between Nov. 15 and Dec 31. Participating resorts include Alexandra Resort and Spa, Caribbean Paradise Inn, Grace Bay Club, Villa Renaissance and Beaches Turks and Caicos. Links to the resorts are at www.turksandcaicostourism.com. Before the hurricanes, resorts in St. Maarten and Barbados had teamed up on islandwide deals. In St. Maarten, 13 hotels -- listed at www.visitstmaarten.com -- have free fourth nights and a $50 voucher for hotels, merchants and car rentals. The deal is good until Dec. 14. More than 30 hotels are participating in the Best of Barbados program, which includes one night free when staying seven nights or longer (five nights at all-inclusive resorts), a day's car rental and a $100 air fare credit per person. The program is in effect until Nov. 30. Information: (800) 221-9831 or www.barbados.org. Not all the islands are cutting prices. Paul Pennicook, Jamaica's director of tourism, met with resort operators, who decided not to lower prices. ''There are already great deals here anyway,'' he said. Still, like Wyndham Rose Hall, some Jamaican hotels have deals. ''We were undamaged, but we did see a drop-off in bookings and some cancellations,'' said Sabrina Absera, general manager of Samsara and Legends resorts, (876) 957-4395, www.negrilhotels.com, in Negril, where about a dozen hotels remained closed in mid-October from storm damage. Ms. Absera is adding a fourth night free through Dec. 20. The base rate is $50 a night. PRACTICAL TRAVELER BARRY ESTABROOK contributes frequently to the Travel section."
"THE chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, F. James Sensenbrenner, spent much of his free time in September glued to the Weather Channel, breaking away from politics to watch as one hurricane after another seemed to come out of nowhere and unleash its fury on all that lay before it. It wasn't out of concern for his constituents that he found himself so occupied. Clustered north and west of Milwaukee, they were safe from the tropical torrents and eye walls. What had Representative Sensenbrenner watching TV, surfing the Internet and practically keeping his travel agent's number on speed dial were his rapidly disintegrating plans for Christmas vacation. He had hoped to spend eight days on the white sand beaches of Grenada. For a while, his vacation seemed secure; the island dodged Hurricanes Charley and Frances. But then Hurricane Ivan came barreling through Grenada, turning it into a disaster zone with 29 people dead and 90 percent of the homes wrecked. From then on, his options seemed to diminish with each passing day. The Cayman Islands and St. Lucia, where Mr. Sensenbrenner had vacationed before, suffered varying degrees of damage. Then, late in September, Tropical Storm Jeanne arrived, plowing past the United States Virgin Islands and shutting down parts of the Dominican Republic. To complicate matters, he was trying to book for the middle of the holidays. ''Christmas week is usually filled up, and it's very hard to connect via San Juan,'' said Mr. Sensenbrenner, who would be flying out of Washington with his family. ''We were in the position of beggars not being choosers.'' His travel agent eventually booked him into a resort on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. The Sensenbrenners are keeping their fingers crossed. This fall has been a time of undeniable angst for the Caribbean tourism industry. ''It's really devastating for travel,'' said Beaumont Martin, a travel consultant for Roland Park Travel in Baltimore. ''You don't know when the properties are going back up. Your e-mails get bounced back, phones are busy and faxes are down.'' Hoping to reassure travelers that all was going to be O.K. before they headed down for their winter holidays, hotels and tourism officials were quick to send out reassuring messages, even from the hardest hit areas. Bel Air, a stylish new villa resort on Grenada, remained ''perfect,'' Susan Fisher, the owner, reported on her Web site on Sept. 22, though another destination on the island, Spice Island Beach Resort, expects to be closed for a year. It was ''business as usual in the Bahamas,'' according to a report on TravelAgentCentral.com on Oct. 5, with ''cruise ships returning'' -- although those ships were not docking in Freeport on Grand Bahama, where the damage was. In terms of destruction, Caribbean officials are already logging this season in the history books. ''Most of the time, a hurricane makes landfall on only one island,'' said Terry Ally, the information specialist at the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency in Barbados, which coordinates disaster relief for its 16 member islands. ''This multi-island strike has not been seen since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. And there have been four major hurricanes that made landfall this season.'' Most of the 30-odd islands and archipelagos of the Caribbean escaped largely unscathed, except for a few fallen palm trees and broken windows. But the damage in seven areas is expected to reach into the billions of dollars, according to the Emergency Response Agency. Besides Grenada and Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands, the worst hit places are the east coast of the Dominican Republic, Grand Bahama in the Bahamas, Negril on Jamaica, and the northeastern end of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. All the islands, though not all of their resorts -- especially on Grenada -- are expected to be open to tourists by the lucrative Christmas season, if not Thanksgiving. And many of the most popular islands, like St. Thomas and Aruba, and even St. Lucia, ended up suffering only minimal damage and were up and running a few days after the storms moved through. Hurricanes create winners and losers, capriciously slamming into some islands while they pass by others with little more than a roar. If the past is a guide, this year's storms will rejigger the tourism landscape, shifting travelers' loyalties away from islands that were in the crosshairs and building up business at others. In 1999 Hurricane Lenny, a Category 4 storm with 135-mile-an-hour winds, lashed through the mid-Caribbean island of Nevis, shutting down its flagship hotel, the lavish 196-room Four Seasons Resort Nevis, for an entire year. Tourist visits plummeted and have not returned to earlier levels. According to the latest figures from the Caribbean Tourism Organization, just 67,500 tourists visited Nevis and its sister island, St. Kitts, in 2002, compared with 93,200 the year before Lenny hit. In Hurricane Luis, in 1995, the big loser was St. Martin, which lost three major hotels, making up 20 percent of its hotel rooms. Fickle customers hopped to other islands. ''Aruba, St. Thomas, Barbados -- those islands benefited when Luis hit us,'' said Regina LaBega, the director of tourism for St. Martin. ''We even lost a lot of our managers and tourism industry personnel,'' she said, ''especially to Aruba.'' Four years after Hurricane Luis, Lenny came through, erasing another 600 rooms. Despite heavy advertising and promotion, only 380,800 tourists went to St. Martin in 2002, compared with 585,700 in 1994. Over those same years, Caribbean tourism as a whole rose sharply, to about 20 million visitors a year from 15.6 million. St. Martin, with its bustling resort strips, lost visitors to other islands with similar settings, like Aruba, Barbados and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. This year, Barbados is expected to see another bump in tourism because it is close to Grenada and both are popular with British travelers. Anguilla, which was hit hard in previous years, saw little but heavy rain this fall and is benefiting from canceled bookings to the higher-end resorts in Grenada. Antigua, the largest of the British Leeward Islands, is anticipating visitors rerouted from Jamaica, which has a similar topography and culture. No matter what the year, islands outside the hurricane beltway, like Bonaire and Turks and Caicos Islands, benefit in any active storm season, as tourists see them as safer bets for reservations. ''Hotels have already seen increased bookings as a result of this year's hurricanes,'' said Lindsey Musgrove, the director of tourism for Turks and Caicos Islands. But the reshuffling of tourists also hinges in large part on tour operators and travel agents, who guide clients toward other existing vacation packages. ''After Lenny hit, we sold a ton of Jamaica, which was not devastated,'' said Lynn Goelzer of Salentine Travel in Mequon, Wis., who is Mr. Sensenbrenner's travel agent. ''That was an easy sell for us, and easy to talk people into. And if we couldn't steer them toward Jamaica, we steered them to the Dominican Republic.'' This year's storms interrupted what had been shaping up as an unusually good year. According to statistics kept by the Caribbean Tourism Organization, visitors had flocked to the beaches. Anguilla, for example, had a 22 percent increase in travelers from January through July over the same months last year. Though he had no updated numbers, Alec Sanguinetti, director general of the Caribbean Hotel Association, professed optimism. The hurricanes ''didn't blow away'' the reasons people travel to the Caribbean in winter, he said in a mid-October interview. Some resorts were also raising prices before the storms, and though many luxury places have not backed off (at opulent Sandy Lane on Barbados the nightly rate for an oceanfront room is $1,900 this winter, up $100 from last winter), some in the travel business do expect the hurricanes to produce bargains. ''We see this winter being, ironically, a boom time in the region,'' said Paul Zar, senior vice president of business development for Liberty Travel and GoGo Worldwide Vacations, as resorts begin offering posthurricane packages and promotions. Travelers should get some breaks on air fares and flight choices, too, as airlines continue to push for larger shares of the Caribbean market, regardless of the weather. ''Fares have been incredibly competitive,'' said Michael Going, Air Jamaica's senior vice president for sales and marketing, adding that his own company's service from North America has increased by 17 percent this year. JetBlue, which started flying to the Dominican Republic in June and has also expanded service to Puerto Rico, will begin daily flights from Kennedy International Airport to Nassau on Nov. 1. Airtran will add a third daily nonstop flight from Atlanta to Grand Bahama on Nov. 4. ATA plans Saturday nonstop service to St. Thomas starting Dec. 18. United, US Airways and Song, Delta's low-fare operator, are adding new Caribbean flights from cities including New York, Chicago and Charlotte, N.C. Despite the ravages of the hurricanes, the tourists who step off those planes from the North will find a new crop of inducements from an industry eager to win their vacation dollars. Here are some examples of what's new this year: Ratcheting Up Luxury On the high end of the market, prime resorts are racing to come up with new ways to make guests feel pampered. In one such effort, 67 elegant villas built amid courtyards and fountains -- many with views from a cliff overlooking the sea -- have been added to Las Casitas Village adjoining Wyndham El Conquistador Resort and Golden Door Spa in Puerto Rico. The bathrooms are marble, butlers are on call 24 hours a day and rates start at $909. (787) 863-1000; www.wyndham.com. Old Bahama Bay, on Grand Bahama, will add 24 units with teak, mahogany, Frette linens and 120-foot-long terraces by the end of 2005; the resort will probably reopen early next year, after repairing hurricane damage. Rates start at $469. (800) 572-5711; www.oldbahamabay.com. New Spas and New Age An ocean-view spa is opening this season at Hôtel Guanahani on St. Bart's, www.leguanahani.com, (011) (590) 590 27 66 60, where a large Indonesian-style daybed is set in a shady area around a lily pond, and the new spa at Virgin Gorda's Biras Creek Resort, www.biras.com, (800) 223-1108, has a yoga platform right on the beach. The BodyHoliday at LeSport on St. Lucia, www.thebodyholiday.com, (800) 544-2883, is adding to a new activity center -- which also caters to such mundane activities as tennis and golf -- with a yoga and tai chi green and a temple and labyrinth for meditation. On Saba, the quest for enlightenment takes a different turn: in a clearing at the small, rain-forested Ecolodge Rendez-Vous, www.ecolodge-saba.com, (011) (599) 416-3348, near mountain trails, is a new American Indian-style sweat lodge, scented with thyme. Family-Friendly Spots At the new 620-room Sunscape the Beach Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, (866) 786-7227, www.sunscaperesorts.com, opening Nov. 21, the kids' club will resemble a pirate ship and big-screen movies will be shown on the beach. At Casa de Campo, the Dominican Republic's most upscale resort, former professional and major league players have been recruited to teach at soccer and baseball clinics for children. On Aruba, children can tour an ostrich farm. At Curaçao's Sea Aquarium, they can interact with sea lions. And on Bonaire, surrounded by coral reefs and hundreds of species of sea creatures, the Bon Bini Divers scuba shop will have a biologist guiding small-group snorkeling sessions open to children as young as 3. In the French Antilles, Aqualand Martinique, a new 10-acre water park, has a pool with artificial waves. The Natural Caribbean On Dominica, a new aerial tram with 22 gondolas takes visitors for almost a mile over and through rain-forest canopy at the edge of the Morne Trois Pitons National Park. St. Croix's new visitor center at the Salt River Bay National Historic Park and Ecological Preserve will have views of the sea, mangroves and the site of the tiny village where, in 1493, on Columbus's second voyage to America, his sailors fought with Carib Indians. Montserrat has a new lookout point at Jack Boy Hill, with vistas of the volcano that devastated the island in a series of eruptions that began in 1995. For Budget Travelers A new hotel on Jamaica, called simply Rooms, (877) 467-8737; www.roomsresorts.com, opens Nov. 15, with 93 units facing a public beach and rates starting at $94. John Issa, chairman of SuperClubs, the developer of Rooms, said he saw a demand for ''nice clean modern rooms, a beach in front, and jerk chicken nearby.'' Turtle Dove Lodge (284) 495-4430, www.bviwelcome.com/turtledl/), with three colorful cottages on Tortola and rates starting at $190, is one of 73 properties available for booking through the British Virgin Islands Tourist Board's new Intimate Hideaways, Charming Cottages, Inns, Hotels and Villas reservations service, (866) 468-6284. If cash is really short, you can always wash the dishes. The cheerful little 17-room Arawak Beach Inn on Anguilla, an island better known for its sumptuous resorts, has a deal this winter for bargain hunters who are willing to do chores. Its new Run Your Own Inn package, described as a training program for prospective innkeepers, starts at $699 a person for seven nights in a $195-a-night room -- all you have to do is daily cleanup work, guest check-in and a little drink mixing at the bar; (264) 497-4888, www.arawakbeach.com. WINTER IN THE SUN FRANCES FRANK MARCUS writes frequently about travel. DENNY LEE writes for the Escapes section of The Times."
"TO see how the Bahamas bowed to the vicissitudes of hurricane season, swing by the straw markets of its rival port cities. As an armada of floating resorts pulled into Nassau in early October, the Straw Market on old Bay Street brimmed with tourists haggling over souvenir T-shirts and flimsy straw hats, even though Hurricane Frances had upended the market's rickety stalls only a few weeks earlier. The scene in Freeport, on Grand Bahama, could not have been more different. In fact, there was no scene at all. The Straw Market at the quirky International Bazaar was shuttered behind pastel-colored doors, its wooden booths devoid of any life. ''It's a little lonely here,'' said Sandra Webb, 37, from Huntersville, N.C., one of the few tourists in Freeport that day. ''We went to a couple of shops yesterday, and they were surprised to see us.'' Although the whipping winds of Hurricane Frances extended 300 miles in diameter, it sliced through the Bahamas in early September with the precision and ferocity of a tornado, sparing most of the archipelago's 700 islands but wreaking havoc in two places: Grand Bahama Island and the small island cluster called the Abacos. The eye of the hurricane never grazed Nassau, the touristy heart of the island of New Providence, and by the first weekend of October, its low season, the pulse had largely returned to normal. Some visitors were oblivious that a Category 4 storm had even passed. ''What hurricane?'' asked Chris Wimer, 25, a student from Dewey Beach, Del., as he polished off a frozen banana cocktail at Señor Frog's, a dockside bar. ''We haven't seen any damage. No uprooted trees, no missing roofs, no nothing.'' West of the tourist districts, the 145-mile-an-hour winds did manage to topple cedar trees along Cable Beach and hammer truck-size sinkholes into West Bay Street, the arterial road to the airport. The SuperClubs Breezes, which suffered the most damage of any large resort on New Providence, resealed its roof and welcomed visitors back on Oct. 1. By the next afternoon, half of its 400 rooms were occupied, as were its 300 blue beach chairs set up along sugar-white sand and turquoise surf. Across the harbor on Paradise Island, the Las Vegas-style Atlantis resort was its usual frenzy of screaming kids, dewy-eyed honeymooners and tipsy gamblers. Next door, at the exclusive One&Only Ocean Club, not a blade of grass seemed out of place. The only whirlwind to hit was the social kind, with boldface guests mingling and marveling at the superficial damage. ''It looks like the palm trees went to the army and got little crew cuts,'' said Thom Filicia, the interior designer from ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' who had flown in for a wedding that everyone seemed to know about. (The bride was Susan Magrino, Martha Stewart's publicist and friend, and her bouquet was occupying much of Ms. Stewart's time in her final days of freedom.) Ordering lunch at the Dune, a restaurant at the Ocean Club that claims a menu conceptualized by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Mr. Filicia had this assessment of the hurricane aftermath: ''I think they lucked out.'' Few would say that about Grand Bahama, 45 minutes away from Nassau by plane, where the resort industry is newer -- and some say scrappier. Hurricane Frances lingered over Grand Bahama for two days, flattening homes, snapping thick trees and peeling off rooftops. Three weeks later, in late September, Hurricane Jeanne essentially finished what Frances had started there, flooding roads and pulling down utility poles that crews had just straightened. Tourist officials played down the devastation, saying, among other things, that the new Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport was ''fully operational.'' But an early October visit suggested an airport on life support. Telephone lines were down, computers were off-line (which meant that some tickets had to be handwritten), and flights were limited to daylight hours because the navigation system required for instrument landings had been washed away. Next door, the airport's old pink terminal had been submerged; it has been deemed not worth saving. Not that tourists were battering down the terminal gates. A month after Hurricane Frances, the island was still digging out. No one was swimming with the dolphins at the Underwater Explorers Society, roads were littered with uprooted mahogany trees and abandoned cars, and one of the few resorts to reopen -- the Pelican Bay Suites at Port Lucaya -- looked more like a construction zone, with scaffolding and exposed roofs, than like one of the island's latest forays into the upscale market. ''Everything stopped,'' said Shantel Robinson, 26, folding and refolding T-shirts at Booth 42 in the Lucaya Marketplace. ''I sold two items today. We need help.'' Most resorts on Grand Bahama are closed at least until December. The Westin and Sheraton at Our Lucaya, a 1,260-room minicity on 372 acres, recalled an abandoned Hollywood set. Pools were drained, the landscaping looked singed, and hallways echoed with the humming of dehumidifiers. The Sheraton reopened on Oct. 14, but most of the waterlogged Westin section, where air ducts were yanked out like spaghetti by 150-m.p.h. winds, is not scheduled to accept guests until Dec. 17. Some tourist hotels are teetering on the brink. The Royal Oasis Golf Resort and Casino in Freeport, the island's aging grande dame, retracted its opening date. The hurricanes tore open a new skylight in the Crowne Plaza Tower and reduced the Holiday Inn to a disaster area. Elsewhere on the island, most residents were without power, telephone service and, in some places, drinking water in early October, prompting the State Department to issue a travel alert, good until Nov. 19, discouraging Americans from visiting the Bahamas. The alert also reinforced the flawed perception that all of the Bahamas are damaged goods. According to a survey last month by the Orlando-based travel marketing firm of Yesawich, Pepperdine, Brown & Russell, nearly 25 percent of leisure travelers polled said they were ''less likely'' to visit the Bahamas later this year as a result of the hurricanes. For the tourism sector, which accounts for 70 percent of the Bahamian economy, the visitor fallout may prove worse than the storm. The biggest concern, more than the straightforward task of rebuilding, is luring visitors back. But resort operators are upbeat. A few are even whispering that the loss of outmoded hotels may help Grand Bahama reposition itself as a more luxurious vacation spot. ''When this reopens, it will be more gorgeous than before,'' said Harris Chan, the general manager of Our Lucaya, which is using an insurance payout to help revamp several wings. ''It's survival of the fittest.'' WINTER IN THE SUN"
"FOUR weeks ago, when I took a leisurely Gulf Coast trip from New Orleans to the Florida Panhandle, vacationers were body surfing in warm waves near the beach pier in Pensacola, Fla. At the Gulf Islands National Seashore nearby, a three-foot-tall great blue heron walked unconcerned through gently waving sea oats and past tourists waiting on the beach to watch the sunset. Last week, when I retraced the same route, Pensacola's concrete pier still stood, battered after being washed over by waves in Hurricane Ivan that offshore buoys recorded at 50 feet. But the road to the national seashore, one of the most popular tourist areas on this coast, lay buried under ruined houses and four-foot piles of sand. Exuberant children and relaxed adults smile out of millions of souvenir photos taken every year on the white beaches of the Florida Panhandle and nearby coastal Alabama. This winter season, the returning vacationers will find favorite spots turned into construction zones as roofs are repaired and boardwalks rebuilt. Where Ivan hit hardest, some landmarks have been simply swept away, with beaches eroded and streets stripped of buildings. ''Our beach house -- it's a washout,'' said Cathy Tanner, a longtime Pensacola-area resident who sells real estate. ''It's 9.6 feet above sea level, and this is the first time this house has ever had water wash through.'' The damage in Pensacola and in the Alabama towns of Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Dauphin Island is jaw-dropping, with beaches disappearing into the sea and empty stretches where million-dollar houses stood. A part of Laguna Key, a community at the western end of Gulf Shores, has been turned into an island. I drove east into the storm's aftermath, taking United States Route 90 from New Orleans. At first I saw less damage than I had expected after apocalyptic newscasts about Ivan's arrival. In Bay St. Louis, Miss., an arts colony and favorite getaway for residents of New Orleans, Da Beach House, a funky beachside kayak shop and coffeehouse restaurant, was open as usual, apparently unharmed. The owners, Todd and Colleen Read, said that they hoped baseless fears of damage from Ivan wouldn't keep away the hordes expected in the next couple of weeks for Cruisin' the Coast, a huge local car show. On a sultry night, the Reads were sitting on the deck of Dock of the Bay, a waterfront restaurant on Bay Street, with Jerry Fisher, the owner and the former lead singer of Blood, Sweat & Tears. His restaurant, too, was unharmed. ''The damage doesn't really start till Mobile,'' Mr. Fisher said. When I got to Alabama, I saw trees down and a few windows out in Mobile, but restaurants like Felix's Fish Camp, which serves some of the best crab cakes in the country, were bustling. It was close to Gulf Shores that the worst of Ivan began to show. Mobile homes and pecan groves were in ruins. Along Alabama Route 59, Lucy Buffett, a restaurateur whose brother, the singer Jimmy Buffett, helped her get into the business several years ago, surveyed the spot along the Intracoastal Waterway where her restaurant's open-air bar and dock used to be. They were smashed by a 397-foot runaway barge that the hurricane ripped from its moorings. Despite the loss, Ms. Buffett's restaurant, LuLu's Sunset Grille, was open and had given 700 free cheeseburgers to relief workers. The damaged tourist businesses would rebuild, she said. ''We are coastal people who love the water, and we're willing to forgive Mother Nature's impudence one more time.'' To cross the Dr. W. C. Holmes bridge into Gulf Shores was to enter a militarized zone, with Humvees parked on the streets and heavily armed guardsmen directing traffic. A group of owners anxious to see what had happened to their beach houses gratefully climbed onto a six-wheel-drive troop transport truck provided by the National Guard. Among them were the Howards of Dallas -- Mary Francis, Tom and their son Billy, who have spent summers at Gulf Shores since 1981. Just this year the elder Howards had been approached with two offers to buy their house for more than $1 million. ''We said, 'No, don't be silly, why would we sell it?' '' Mrs. Howard said. ''Now, my husband is saying, 'I told you we should have sold it.' But even if we lose everything and don't even have a lot to sell, this place has been worth it.'' As the transport rumbled toward Beach Boulevard, the passengers gaped in amazement. The ocean had submerged a substantial swath of land, the popular Gulf Shores Seafood Market was gutted, and the famously tacky Souvenir City, with a huge shark out front, was destroyed. Across from the city beach, the town's landmark 1960's-era amusement park, with a Tilt-a-Whirl and a Scrambler, lay half buried by sand and utterly ruined. ''This was our grandkids' favorite place,'' Mrs. Howard sighed. The transport made its way west, along a section of road where some houses had been ripped from their foundations and were simply gone. Others had been carried across the street and smashed. A few miles farther on, Mrs. Howard let out a cheer. Her family's stilted house was standing, though with no stairs and about 100 yards less of beach out front. Another passenger in the transport, Rob Jaeger, a real estate agent, was registering that his home, too, was still standing. Asked if he thought this destruction would cool off a local real estate market in which 100 feet of beachfront property fetches $1.7 million, he shook his head. ''I just got a call from a guy in Atlanta who wants to buy right now,'' he said. From Gulf Shores, Pensacola is a 40-mile trip along Route 98. On the outskirts, poorly built commercial buildings were blown open. But downtown, in the Seville Historic District, where the earliest structures date back to the 1700's, most of the Creole, Greek Revival and Victorian homes and shops appeared to have survived. On the approach to the famous Three Mile Bridge over Pensacola Bay, police directed traffic past the long-abandoned Highway 98 bridge. A month earlier, this rusty relic had been lined with anglers using it as a vast idyllic fishing pier. Now, long stretches of the bridge were at the bottom of Pensacola Bay. At Pensacola's public beach and pier, a makeshift relief center was offering disaster counseling, water and packaged military meals. A beleaguered-looking group had just returned from assessing the remains of their houses in the Villa Sabine neighborhood. Among them were Thomas Campanella, a board member of the Santa Rosa Island Authority, which governs Pensacola Beach, and his daughter Lauren. ''The house is at six feet of elevation and we had 42 inches of water in it,'' Mr. Campanella said. ''It's phenomenal that we've had this kind of damage.'' He estimated that 99 percent of the buildings in the area had sustained some kind of damage, and that 40 to 45 percent had been destroyed or damaged catastrophically. Although visitors will certainly be welcome again by next summer, he said, it will be five years before it is possible to visit Pensacola Beach and see no signs of Ivan. Living on this coast, is ''a percentage game,'' Mr. Campanella said, adding, ''We've been out here for 30 years and have dodged all these storms.'' ''We'll rebuild,'' his daughter said. ''It's just the price you pay for living in paradise.'' JOURNEYS"
"NASA has abandoned plans to resume flying the space shuttle next March because of the impact of four hurricanes on space agency centers and work schedules, officials said Friday. Officials running NASA's space flight program, meeting at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the record number of hurricanes that pummeled Florida this summer made the planned March-April launching window ''no longer achievable.'' Space flight managers directed the shuttle program to determine whether it would be feasible to resume flights during the next available launching opportunity, a 22-day period that opens on May 14, 2005, or at a later time. This analysis is due by the end of October, when flight leaders have another meeting scheduled. The remaining three space shuttles have been grounded since the Columbia and its crew of seven was destroyed upon re-entry from space on Feb. 1, 2003. Accident investigators attributed the disaster to an undetected breach in one of the shuttle's wings at launching and a lax safety culture at NASA, and they stipulated 15 recommended reforms that must be carried out before the fleet flies again. NASA officials said they had met 5 of the 15 recommendations and would resume flights only when the benchmarks were met, not because of a time schedule. ''More than a year ago, we set out a specific plans for return to flight with specific milestones,'' William Readdy, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, said in a statement. ''Right now, those milestones are pointing us toward a new launch window.'' Because of launching restrictions recommended by the Columbia investigators, NASA can try shuttle flights only during certain times of the year when lighting and other conditions are optimum. If the flight window available next May does not prove workable, the next period officials could consider would open on July 12."
"Marguerite Dorima, seven months pregnant in a faded yellow sundress, sloshed through the muddy, fetid waters that still occupied the heart of Gonaïves last weekend, three weeks after Tropical Storm Jeanne provoked flash floods that killed some 1,900 people and left 900 missing and presumed dead. With one hand on her white lace head scarf and the other on her bulging belly, Ms. Dorima maneuvered the slippery muck with the aid of makeshift bridges made of splintery boards and discarded plastic jugs. She was determined to make it to a food distribution center to get rice and beans to last her family of eight through another week. But there would be no handouts that day. In an act of supreme political miscalculation, the daily distribution of food had been suspended because Haiti's provisional president and prime minister were coming to town to mourn the victims of the tropical storm. On learning this, Ms. Dorima sighed and peered at the white tanks encircling the city's imposing cathedral, where a ''symbolic Mass'' was to about to take place for the dead who had been unceremoniously buried, together with some goats and cows, in a mass grave at the edge of town. Ms. Dorima was grieving for her 7-year-old niece, Jean-Claudine, but she had not known about the memorial service and, exhausted, did not attend. Few did. Instead, a large, ragtag group gathered outside to shout its frustration with the caretaker government's response to the disaster. Their chants of ''Liars! Thieves!'' drowned out the worshipers singing ''Take pity on me, Lord, take pity on your people.'' And as the politicians flew back to the capital after failing to audibly address the crowd, the angry men vented their rage by burning tires and shooting. The storm's devastation of Gonaïves, Haiti's third-largest city, has exposed the continuing fragility of Haiti seven months after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, facing a mounting revolt by former military officers and rebels, resigned under international pressure. In the wake of the storm, a surge of bloody unrest in the slums of Port-au-Prince, the capital, has laid bare the country's continuing volatility, too. The violence grew out of demonstrations by Mr. Aristide's supporters to mark the Sept. 30 anniversary of a military coup that toppled him during his first term in office, and some of it has been especially grisly. A former military official's headless, castrated body was left to decompose near the capital's port last week. This week, tensions escalated even further, when former military officials, who now control several provincial towns despite the fact that their army was disbanded in 1995, pledged to gather in the capital to confront the violence. With new pro-Aristide demonstrations scheduled for Saturday, Port-au-Prince was bracing for a fresh round of bloodshed over the weekend. These twin crises, natural and political, underscore the immensity of the underlying challenges that the country faces. Haiti's ravaged environment would require decades of sustained effort to repair, and reforming the culture of impunity in which the ruthless armed gangs thrive would require a long-term international commitment to lifting Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere, out of its despair. But, as is often the case, Haiti's emergencies take precedence, and the emergencies now are in Gonaïves, where international aid efforts have been hampered by widespread looting, and in Port-au-Prince, where the specter of a direct battle between former military officers and militant supporters of Mr. Aristide looms. Haiti has effectively been in international receivership since Feb. 29, when Mr. Aristide, the country's first democratically elected president, was placed on a Pentagon jet into exile. But its transitional government, even with the bolstering of a United Nations peacekeeping force and more than $1 billion in pledged international aid, is inherently weak just as the destructive forces here are strong. International officials here fear that the current unrest could profoundly undermine the world community's fledgling -- and some here say halfhearted -- effort to steer Haiti toward reconstruction, reconciliation and elections in 2005. Of primary concern, there are still large numbers of weapons on the streets. The American marines who, with French Legionnaires, took over Haiti's security after Mr. Aristide's ouster did restore order, but they did not undertake a serious disarmament effort before turning security control over to United Nations peacekeepers in June. So far the United Nations troops have not done so either. Gérard Latortue, a Florida resident who was chosen as Haiti's interim prime minister by an American-backed council of prominent Haitians in March, recently described how he begged Secretary of State Colin L. Powell not to withdraw the Marines all at once. ''Unfortunately, the Americans preferred to send their troops elsewhere, forgetting their neighborhood,'' Mr. Latortue said in a speech in Miami. Many other countries dragged their heels on committing the forces that they pledged to the United Nations. The peacekeeping force will be outnumbered by armed thugs even at its promised strength of 8,300 soldiers and civilian police officers. But the force is still not even at half-strength. This greatly troubles officials in Haiti, since development efforts hinge on security. ''I'm afraid of a continued deterioration in the security situation,'' said Adama Guindo, resident coordinator for the United Nations in Haiti. ''The international community must remain engaged to help stabilize this country. Haiti cannot live on emergency aid alone.'' The Rising Waters In the early evening of Sept. 18, Héber Pélissier, president of the local chamber of commerce, stood on the second-floor balcony of his home and watched in horror as the waters suddenly rose. ''The water took several cars with it, and then the panic started,'' he said. ''It began to get dark, and I heard cries: ''Help me, I am going to die, save me, I am drowning.''' As water swallowed the first story of his house, bodies began floating by and he felt helpless, he said. He gathered his family around him and they prayed. ''I had this belief deep inside me that there is a limit to the fury of God,'' Mr. Pélissier, a broad-shouldered man with salt-and-pepper hair, said last weekend, choking back a single sob. ''I said to God, 'Many have died here. This is it. We don't want any more to die.''' Mr. Pélissier speculated that God was punishing his town for its perpetual leading role in Haiti's violent history. Gonaïves was the birthplace of Haiti's independence 200 years ago, the seat of the uprising against the 30-year Duvalier regime and the kickoff zone for the revolt against Mr. Aristide. Recently, Gonaïves, a city of 250,000 that was once a flourishing cotton center, has been a lawless haven for gangs and rebels, so turbulent that its schools have essentially been shuttered since November 2003. While some places in Haiti have environmental and disaster plans, Gonaïves is not one of them. ''Nature decided that it was payback time for the bad management of ecological problems in the Gonaïves area,'' said Prime Minister Latortue, a native of the city. Extreme environmental degradation, especially deforestation, has made Haiti extremely susceptible to natural disaster. When rainwater rushes downstream unfettered by trees, catchment areas or drains, it sets off deadly flash floods. It did not take a hurricane or even a particularly strong tropical storm to wash away or destroy thousands of homes in Gonaïves. Many still standing are surrounded by moats of chocolate-colored water, and many residents are living on their roofs amid crushed bed frames and brightly hued piles of sodden clothing. Tens of thousands are completely homeless, like Ms. Dorima's sister, whose husband left her after their little girl was ''lost to the waters.'' ''All she has left to her name is one pair of panties,'' Ms. Dorima said. Pigs roam the muddy streets, nosing around in piles of rotting garbage. Many alleyways have become filthy canals, turning Gonaïves into a putrid version of Venice. On the outskirts, almost all crops were destroyed and livestock drowned. Noel Madiro Morilus, an agriculture official, traveled to the cathedral on Saturday to ''launch an urgent SOS'' for Terre-Neuve, his region of some 25,000 north of Gonaïves that had yet to receive any aid or official visits. ''Please get us help,'' he urged an American journalist, who brought his concerns to a United Nations official's attention. ''We have hundreds of homeless, many are running constant fevers, the children have bumps on their skin. Seventeen people have died, and more are dying. We are drinking unpurified water and we have nothing to eat.'' A Spike in Violence Rival armed groups and gangs began flexing their muscles over the summer, as crimes like carjacking increased, a full-dress military parade took place in the capital and pro-Aristide militants staged a brief showdown with international forces in Cité-Soleil, a Port-au-Prince slum. The spike in violence, however, began precisely on Sept. 30, when supporters of Mr. Aristide marched to demand his return. Mr. Aristide and his wife just accepted appointments as research fellows at the University of South Africa, indicating they have settled in there. But he has said that he was forced to leave Haiti, and his supporters -- the slum-based populist movement called Lavalas, which means cleansing flood -- want Mr. Aristide, a former priest, to finish out his second term in office, which was supposed to end in 2005. The Sept. 30 march began peacefully, but gunfire erupted, setting off bloody battles between the Haitian police and Aristide supporters. Each side blamed the other for starting the violence, which has created a worrisome climate of insecurity ever since. Like Tropical Storm Jeanne, which hit a city where no one was really in charge, the violence has underscored the tenuousness of the interim government's control. Hastily assembled in March under American supervision, the government has no political power base, except in the tiny elite, which considers it professional. Mr. Latortue, 70, an impeccably dressed man who keeps his nails well buffed, is a self-described technocrat who moved back to Haiti from Boca Raton, Fla., to take up his post. In a fiercely divided society with more than 90 political parties, Mr. Latortue, a former United Nations official, says he is nonpartisan. ''We just want a national reconciliation until elections can take place in 2005,'' he said. But the government has come to be seen by many here, including some international officials, as partial toward the former military and anti-Lavalas. Mr. Latortue himself saluted a former rebel leader as a ''freedom fighter,'' and, in a hasty, overnight trial, his government exonerated another rebel leader of his notoriously violent past. Mr. Latortue's government has allowed former military officers and rebels to take charge or remain in charge of several towns, including Petit-Goâve, where, dressed in their old uniforms, former soldiers have installed themselves in the police station. The government also appeased former soldiers by signing an agreement to create a bureau of former military officials, pay pensions, hand out security jobs and study the idea of reviving a Haitian army. In exchange, the former soldiers agreed to give up their weapons. But they have not been pressed to do so. And this week, ex-soldiers who helped topple Mr. Aristide were issuing increasingly bellicose statements about the violence roiling the capital, boasting of new recruits and plans to march on the capital. ''Someone needs to take control,'' Guy Philippe, 36, a rebel leader who is considered one of the most influential former military officials, said in an interview last week. But he also said that he himself was ''not in the mood'' to pick up arms again. Some international officials here believe that Mr. Latortue is handling the former military with kid gloves while others see it as finesse. But many are concerned about what they see as the current Haitian government's tendency to vilify Lavalas, which still has significant popular support. This, they say, is creating antagonism rather than courting compromise. Among Mr. Aristide's supporters, passions have been inflamed by the recent arrests of several Lavalas leaders. Louis Gérald Gilles, one of them, said in an interview after his release that he saw his arrest as part of a concerted effort to discredit and eliminate Lavalas. ''They interrogated us and suggested we were the intellectual authors of the violence,'' Dr. Gilles, a surgeon, said. ''But we are not. Every sector in our society has its extremists, including Lavalas. Every sector uses guns to destroy democracy in Haiti. Lavalas remains the most popular party. It is unwise to treat us as the root of all evil because it is a way of disdaining the people.'' Caught in the middle of these roiling emotions is the risk-adverse, understaffed United Nations peacekeeping force. Starting last week, United Nations troops and Haitian police officers carried out joint raids aimed at flushing out militants. They arrested more than 120 people. But they seized few weapons, at least partly because some Haitian police officers leaked news of the raids before they took place, Gen. Augusto Heleno Pereira of Brazil, the commander of the United Nations peacekeepers here, said in an interview. Jean-Claude Bajeux, who served in Mr. Aristide's first cabinet but later turned against him, said the joint operations were not serving any real purpose if they didn't take guns off the streets. ''You have to block a sector for 24 hours, shut it down, then go from house to house,'' Mr. Bajeux said. ''If there is no will or appetite to do this, then the U.N. should leave.'' But General Heleno said that a forceful disarmament operation in a congested shantytown was a delicate task, and that he did not want to escalate tensions or cause civilian deaths. He would prefer to persuade people to give up their arms rather than to take them by force, anyway, he said. A Struggle for Food In Gonaïves, the distribution of food has created heartrending scenes. Large crowds of women wait shoulder to shoulder for hours under a broiling sun, pushed up against barbed wire and surrounded by peacekeeping troops, some in riot gear. Faint from heat and hunger, the women jostle and tumble, desperate to get their rations before the day's supply runs out. From the start of the relief effort, supply trucks have struggled over severely damaged roads, fording a three-foot-deep lake at the edge of town. They have been stopped by flaming barricades and have suffered considerable looting. Last week, the violence in Port-au-Prince closed the port for several days, blocking aid shipments. CARE officials said that their food supplies were dwindling and that, with some peacekeeping troops heading back to Port-au-Prince to deal with the violence there, they were very concerned about security. They were planning to cut their food distribution to two sites from four. Last weekend, they did not distribute any food at all. On Saturday, the local government decided that it needed to divert security to protect the politicians and on Sunday, local officials said that they were ''too tired from the president's visit,'' Joseph Jouthe of CARE said. During the Mass, the president and the prime minister sat stiffly side by side in black armchairs in front of the pews. Afterward, they tried to address the restive crowd outside. They ascended to a balcony and the figurehead president, Boniface Alexandre, began to speak through a small, tinny loudspeaker. He was inaudible, and the people chanted, ''We can't hear you.'' The two provisional politicians then descended, ringed by security. After another brief, unsuccessful effort to communicate using the inadequate megaphone, they climbed in their cars and drove off, effectively leaving a former rebel leader in charge. Before long, tires were flaming and gunshots rang through the air. Through the afternoon, in the tense streets of a city that has sparked so many rebellions, young men drummed on empty water jugs and chanted the songs they used to sing against Mr. Aristide, changing the target to vent their latest fury. ''Whether he wants to or not,'' they shouted, again and again, ''Boniface must go.''"
"The Legislature on Thursday approved $185 million in aid to people whose homes were ravaged by hurricanes this year and altered Florida's insurance rules, a move that lawmakers said would increase costs statewide. Borrowing up to $150 million from a state catastrophe fund, the relief package will help at least 30,000 homeowners who had to pay multiple deductibles when four hurricanes hit the state in six weeks, legislators said. In Florida, the deductible is generally 2 percent to 5 percent of a home's value. Under the plan, homeowners who paid two deductibles this year will qualify for up to $10,000 in state reimbursement, and those who paid three or more will qualify for up to $20,000. The bill also eliminates multiple deductibles for hurricane victims in the future, so that Floridians need pay only one deductible per hurricane season even if hit by several storms. Sam Miller, executive vice president of the Florida Insurance Council, said his industry supported the change even though premium costs would rise by perhaps half a percentage point to replenish the catastrophe fund over the next few years. ''We did not intend to impose the hurricane deductible three and four times on folks,'' said Mr. Miller, whose group represents Florida insurance companies. ''The increase is going to hopefully be negligible.'' Eliminating multiple deductibles will lead to a separate, larger cost increase of 1 percent to 4 percent on home insurance policyholders, he said. The Republican-dominated Legislature also approved a plan to give tax rebates of up to $1,500 to people who paid property tax on homes they could not live in after the hurricanes. The legislation sets aside $20 million for the rebates, available to people whose homes were uninhabitable for at least 60 days and who apply by March 1. An additional $15 million will provide sales tax refunds to storm victims buying replacement mobile homes. Lawmakers also approved a $100 million loan program to help school districts make hurricane-related repairs while they wait for federal aid, and $68 million to help restore damaged beaches. ''I don't think that you can ever do too much for people who have lost everything,'' said Senator James E. King Jr., a Republican from Jacksonville. ''We recognize the loss. We're going to step in and help.'' Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican who called the weeklong special legislative session to address hurricane and education issues, said he was pleased with the relief package. But he added: ''There's more to be done. This next session will be full of opportunities to learn from the lessons of the four storms.'' Some lawmakers fought the plan to borrow money from the state catastrophe fund, which was created after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 to help insurers pay for especially large hurricane losses. They wanted the money to come instead from the state's general fund, but they were outvoted by others, including Mr. Bush, who said that would threaten the state's fiscal health. Some lawmakers also complained that the relief package did not provide nearly enough money for people who desperately needed it. The Red Cross has estimated that about 25,000 homes were destroyed in the four hurricanes, which hit in August and September, and that an additional 50,000 suffered major damage. But Tom Gallagher, the state's chief financial officer, said he thought the package sufficed. ''I think the money is pretty close to right,'' Mr. Gallagher said of the deductible reimbursement plan. ''It won't take care of everybody, but it will take care of 75 to 90 percent, maybe even higher.'' Florida has often been a trendsetter on insurance. In 1996, it became the first state to establish hurricane deductibles based on a percentage of the insured value of houses and condominiums. Now, many states along the Atlantic Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as Hawaii, have such deductibles. Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said he did not think other states would follow Florida's lead on applying only one deductible per hurricane season. The general practice in insurance, he said, is that a deductible is applied for each damage claim. ''If someone has ice damage in a Northern state in January and a similar claim in March, it is going to be two deductibles,'' Mr. Hartwig said."
"Greg Lawrence talks about the $10 bag of ice. Kenneth Kleppach says he was clipped for nearly three times the advertised price for a hotel room. And a man with a chain saw told Jerry Olmstead that he could clear the oak tree off his roof, but it would cost $10,500. So much for a friendly, helping hand in a time of crisis. Since the winds of Hurricane Charley subsided, officials say a wave of price gouging has swept across central and southwest Florida, putting law enforcement officials into high gear and infuriating storm victims already faced with damaged homes, shuttered workplaces and long lines for basic commodities. ''Why do people try to capitalize on other people's hardship and misery,'' Mr. Olmstead asked as he fumed over the tree removal. ''Of course it angers me. They see an opportunity and, fine, if you want to make a little money. But there's a limit. This is ludicrous.'' Charlie Crist, Florida's attorney general, said Tuesday afternoon that he had received more than 1,400 complaints of overcharging from throughout the disaster area. This morning he filed formal complaints against the Crossroads Motor Lodge in Lakeland and the Days Inn Airport Hotel in West Palm Beach, accusing them of price gouging and deceptive business practices. Not every complaint checks out, and certainly the stricken areas of Florida are filled with volunteers and people offering free food or charity. But there are also those brazenly looking to make some extra money. Some gas stations facing long lines of cars with empty tanks are charging $3 a gallon for gas that would normally go for $1.78, said John McMahon, a sheriff's investigator in Orlando's surrounding Orange County. In one of the boldest cases, some contractors from Jacksonville offered to clear two trees off the roof of an Orlando woman for $23,000, Mr. McMahon said. The woman declined the offer. In Port Charlotte and in Arcadia, two of the most devastated places, scam artists have been posing as independent insurance claims adjusters, offering, for $500 to $2,000, to help resolve claims with insurance companies, the state's Department of Insurance said. Mr. Crist said of the complaints coming into his office, ''This is just the start.'' He added, ''We saw this after Hurricane Andrew and we're seeing it again.'' Mr. Crist has dispatched teams to help consumers, and squads of sheriff's deputies and consumer advocates are also working to discourage price gouging. While many of the complaints have been coming from Punta Gorda and Arcadia, Orlando, at nearly 200 complaints, is leading the list, with Fort Myers, just south of where the hurricane came ashore on the Gulf Coast, running a close second. Under Florida law, each proven case of price gouging carries a penalty of $1,000; each case of deceptive business practices carries a penalty of $10,000 except when the victim is over 60, in which case the penalty rises to $15,000. The complaints began to trickle in as the storm was approaching and a few came in immediately afterward. But now the pace is picking up, said Sara Kinsey, who has been working late into the night answering the attorney general's complaint hot line. She said she had heard from a man who said he was told that the new price for a small household generator was now $2,000, up from about $250. Many of the complaints have been for two necessities: bottled water and ice. But prices have also jumped for construction work and construction materials, and the authorities expect more of that as the recovery stretches on. Janet Snyder, a pharmacy technician in Cape Coral, said several men in two pickup trucks spotted her roof damage and offered to lay down a temporary covering of plastic sheeting. They wanted $600, about four times what she figured was the right price, based on 15 rolls of plastic that usually sell for $10 each. Across the state, in Ormund Beach, Chris Boyce, a salesman for a roofing supply company, said that when his company tried to restock on Monday the wholesaler tried to raise the price of tar paper 40 percent, to $10.50 for a roll of 216 square feet. ''That's criminal,'' Mr. Boyce said he told the wholesaler, adding, ''I'd rather not have it at that price.'' Ms. Kinsey said that in one instance a price gouger simply took advantage of anxiety and fear that there was no ice to be had. He bought several chests of ice in a grocery store in a mall at the usual $1 or so for a big party-size bag, she said, stepped outside and began selling scoops of ice for $2 each. Mr. Lawrence, a cook who is studying to become a Web site designer, came across a gas station here in Orlando selling the equivalent of two $1 bags for $10. ''I said, 'Are you kidding?' and he just looked at me,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''There were mobs of people buying ice from the guy. Even though that was the only place I could find ice, I refused to buy it.'' The first wave of opportunistic pricing came from motels and hotels as the hurricane was approaching, Mr. Crist said. Many people fled the Tampa Bay area after forecasters calculated incorrectly that the hurricane would be coming ashore there. Mr. Kleppach and his family were among them. They drove inland, and every hotel they checked was full. They continued across the state to the East Coast city of Fort Pierce and still could not find a room. Finally, in West Palm Beach, Mr. Kleppach said in court documents filed in the attorney general's lawsuits, he saw a sign at the Days Inn Airport Hotel reading, ''ALL ROOMS - $39.99.'' There were two rooms left. But the price, Mr. Kleppach said, was $109.00. ''I was desperate and needed shelter for my family,'' he said, ''so I took the room for that price.'' At the hotel on Tuesday, Andrew Hill, the manager, refused to discuss the attorney general's accusations. In Plant City, just east of Tampa, Rosemary Duffield, who is in her 80's, decided she should get out of her mobile home and she booked a room a little farther inland, at the Crossroads Motor Lodge in Lakeland, she said in court papers. She was told the price would be $44.79, she said. But when she called to reconfirm later in the day, the price was $55.79. After checking in on Friday and settling into her room, she discovered that she had been charged $61.27. She did not argue with the hotel, but she complained to the attorney general. She did not respond to a reporter's message left on her answering machine Tuesday. At the Crossroads Motor Lodge, a man who said he was the manager but would not give his name denied that he had been overcharging. ''How can we gouge?'' he asked. ''We advertise in the newspaper.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE ECONOMICS Correction: August 19, 2004, Thursday A front-page article yesterday about price gouging in the wake of Hurricane Charley in Florida misstated a detail about Rosemary Duffield's complaint with the state attorney general's office over the price of a hotel room. Ms. Duffield did indeed respond to a reporter's message, confirming the account she had given to the attorney general. The article also misspelled the name of a city where a roofing supply salesman said he found a 40 percent increase in the cost of tar paper. It is Ormond Beach, not Ormund Beach. In some copies, an author identification note misidentified the city from which a correspondent reported. It is Lakeland, not Lackland."
"Disaster relief officials warned on Tuesday that stressful housing conditions, intense summer heat and diseases from contaminated food and water could cause the problems from Hurricane Charley to increase in coming days. Until electricity is restored, thousands of residents could be subject to heat stroke in the muggy 90-degree weather, poisoning from eating spoiled food and diseases caused by sewage-contaminated water, the officials said. As of Tuesday evening, more than 490,000 people were still without power. Touring parts of the storm-ravaged western Florida coast, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said there were ''so many health areas'' that posed a risk in the aftermath of the storm. ''The president has demanded that every federal department to whatever they possibly can to aid the recovery effort,'' Mr. Thompson, wearing muddy sneakers, said in Fort Myers. ''Every request will be fulfilled to satisfy all of Florida's needs.'' But five days after the powerful Category 4 storm ripped a path across the state, federal and local officials were sending a message that residents should prepare for a frustratingly slow reconstruction process that could take months to complete. ''People are pushing as hard as they can'' to rebuild and get services going again, said Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, who toured the coast with Mr. Thompson. Mr. Ridge predicted that the ''disappointment and sorrow'' caused by the storm damage would soon turn into frustration as reconstruction dragged on. On Tuesday, officials said the death toll from the storm had risen by one to 20, after an 86-year-old man who had evacuated his home fell and died in a motel. Government and private relief officials said they were concerned about the psychological strain on thousands of people who had fled storm-damaged homes to stay with friends and relatives in crowded shelters or cramped motel rooms. Though many of them are getting along fine now, many are also likely to find those living conditions unbearable within days, officials said. Experts said domestic violence, substance abuse and even suicide could result from the stress of being displaced. For that reason, the Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of mental health experts to begin door-to-door visits with displaced people, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is preparing to locate long-term temporary housing for storm victims. ''There is this honeymoon phase of a disaster response when people are pulling together and helping each other,'' said Peter R. Teahen, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Florida. ''But if they are staying in other people's homes, after a week or 10 days those people want their house back and everyone is getting on each others' nerves. Then you see the stress level and anxiety levels go up.'' Beverly Gill, 42, is among the many doubling up with a relative. Her home in Punta Gorda, one of the most severely damaged towns, has no power or water, and the howling winds blew out most of her windows. So she moved two of her three children into her father's nearby home, leaving her 15-year-old son behind to guard her house against looters. Ms. Gill, a school teacher, said she was getting along fine in her father's house. But when asked how long she expected to stay there, she cast a wary glance at her father and replied in a whisper, ''I don't know.'' At a shelter in Englewood, west of Punta Gorda, Crystal Hanisch, 25, said she, her husband and their two small children stayed briefly with her husband's parents after the hurricane blew the roof off her apartment unit and caused part of the living room roof to collapse. But her mother-in-law was preoccupied caring for her severely ill husband, and the house seemed too cramped for the family's 5-year-old son and 10-month-old daughter. So they decamped to a Red Cross shelter in a middle school, where they now live on cots and share bathrooms with dozens of other refugees. ''I'm tired, so tired,'' Ms. Hanisch said as she cradled her infant daughter on a cafeteria bench. ''I just miss being able to shower when I want to shower.'' But Ms. Hanisch said she had no clear options for short-term housing. She has been told that the waiting list for public housing is prohibitively long, and she has been unable to reach federal disaster relief officials on the telephone. She would consider moving her family to her stepfather's home in Georgia, but has been unable to reach him. ''I have no idea what we'll do,'' Ms. Hanisch said. Many others are making do under hardscrabble conditions in their heavily damaged homes, refusing to leave either out of fear of looters or because they have nowhere to go. Others have resorted to living in tents or cars. Evelyn Loehnert, 85, and her husband, Arthur, 92, have stayed in their Punta Gorda house even though the storm demolished several rooms and tore off part of the roof. They have put wood planks over holes in the floor and have been sleeping on a couch and reclining chair in their living room, which still has a ceiling. They considered moving into a hotel, but could not find one with rooms available. Local officials said they expected shelter populations to rise as more people like the Loehnerts feel the need to give up on their damaged homes or leave friends' houses after long stays. ''Those that are staying short term with loved ones may decide they don't want to be a burden,'' said Matt Holloman, the public information coordinator for DeSoto County. ''Pride may drive them to go to a shelter rather than stay with someone for a week at a time.'' State officials said there were 1,992 people in shelters on Tuesday. But the number of displaced people is in the thousands, and probably tens of thousands, they said. For instance, a damage assessment by federal and Red Cross officials based on satellite images and on-the-ground inspections concluded that nearly 6,000 homes were destroyed and more than 10,000 pthers severely damaged. Red Cross officials said those numbers would rise significantly because the assessment covered only two-thirds of the affected region. Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington said that 32,242 people had applied for federal housing assistance, which could include money for hotels, repairs or rent. They have also estimated that the state will need at least 10,000 preassembled homes to replace destroyed homes. FEMA has also established a drive-through service station in Punta Gorda, where a representative greets each driver and members of the Florida National Guard load canned food, water, tarpaulins for damaged roofs and other supplies into cars. Matt Holloman, the public information coordinator for DeSoto County, said that at least 2,600 homes in the largely rural county suffered major damage, and another 2,000 sustained minor damage. ''So right there we are pushing 5,000 homes,'' Mr. Holloman said, ''and if our two shelters are only packing 100 folks a night on average, those people are obviously going somewhere else.'' DeSoto County, which covers 660 square miles, has many multigenerational families, he said, so many storm victims can stay with relatives close by. That contrasts with Charlotte County and some of the other coastal counties, where many of those affected were retirees whose relatives live in other parts of the country. HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE OVERVIEW"
"Timothy Tychi was worried sick. Every day for the past week, Mr. Tychi, of Wallingford, Conn., had been calling his 82-year-old aunt in this citrus-belt town to see if she had weathered Hurricane Charley in good condition. But the telephones still do not work here, and all the local sheriff's office could tell him was that his aunt, Catherine Ann Houck, was not in a hospital or a morgue. ''All the people in this county have been accounted for,'' officials informed him. It was little consolation. Each night, he watched grim news photographs of storm devastation in his aunt's rural neighborhood, angst-ridden by his inability to reach her and her 86-year-old husband, Robert. But on Thursday, Mr. Tychi finally got word from his aunt when Red Cross workers pulled into her driveway, handed her a cellphone and dialed his number. ''We came through it, Tim,'' Mrs. Houck told him as she stood outside her yellow brick ranch house, surrounded by uprooted trees. ''It looks like somebody's bombarded us.'' Officially, there are few, if any, people missing from the destruction of Hurricane Charley, authorities say. But thousands of people remain unaccounted for in the minds of friends and relatives who have been unable to reach them because of widespread telephone and power failures. Since the powerful storm dashed across Florida last Friday, more than 6,700 people have called the Red Cross searching for loved ones. The Red Cross, which runs a service to track down missing people in disaster areas, has closed only about 700 of those cases. A week after the storm, the agency still receives anxious inquiries at the rate of more than 100 a day, agency officials said. ''The people here are in survival mode, thinking about getting food and a place to sleep,'' said Cindy Desmond, a Red Cross worker from Sarasota. ''They don't realize the world is frantic about them.'' The Red Cross is not the only agency receiving those calls. Sheriff's offices, hospitals, the Salvation Army, local newspapers and television stations have been inundated with calls from people around the country seeking news of their friends and family. One local newspaper, The Charlotte Sun, received so many inquiries that it decided to post a listing of ''missing'' people on its Web site with a return e-mail address for anyone with information about those people. There were about 70 names posted on the Web site on Thursday afternoon. ''The volume of inquiries has been overwhelming,''' said Scott Corwin, the paper's Internet editor. ''And they are still coming.'' Law enforcement authorities and Red Cross officials say they believe that the vast majority of unaccounted-for people are safe and simply out of touch with the outside world. Many still cannot use their regular telephones and do not own cellphones, while others have disappeared to neighbors' homes, shelters or motels without telling friends and relatives. Such assurances do little to calm people from outside the region. But there is little that overwhelmed law enforcement agencies can do to check on the welfare of residents, unless there is a clear emergency, officials said. ''To try to reach every caller's Aunt Mae would be a real operational challenge,'' said Paul Filla, a spokesman for the Lee County Public Safety Department. ''We expect that as electricity and phone service comes back up, most of those people will surface and get back in touch with their loved ones.'' Even people within the storm-ravaged region are still searching for friends, relatives and neighbors. Stella Lunenfeld of Punta Gorda, one of the worst-hit towns, said she had not been in contact with her 38-year-old daughter, Terry, since the storm struck. Mrs. Lunenfeld and her husband fled to a shelter after the hurricane tore open their mobile home. Since then, they have repeatedly called and visited their daughter's apartment in Punta Gorda, with no luck. The apartment's ceiling is caved in, the door swinging open, with no signs of life inside. ''I'm so worried; do you think you could try to find her?'' Mrs. Lunenfeld asked a visitor to the shelter recently. To help locate people, the Red Cross has developed an elaborate system that has been honed and expanded since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the Red Cross was overwhelmed by calls from around the world inquiring about victims. For Hurricane Charley, the Red Cross dispatched more than 200 workers to its response center in Northern Virginia, where operators handle inquiries to the agency's emergency information line, 1-866-GET-INFO. From there, inquiries about missing persons are sent to the agency's research unit, which checks them against lists of people who have registered for Red Cross assistance or shelter. It also calls hospitals and checks with churches and other community agencies. ''We're kind of the missing person's bureau,'' said Steve Whitehead, who is overseeing the Red Cross's welfare information operation for the hurricane. ''We try to do some detective work.'' When all else fails, the agency will send teams to visit people's homes. On Thursday, the first of those teams in Florida began knocking on doors in and around Arcadia, which took a brutal beating in the storm. The team's first inquiry had arrived in an e-mail note on Wednesday night from a couple in Orlando, Raul and Maria Pou, who had been desperately seeking news about Maria's aunt and uncle, Bev and Don Shaw. When Cindy Desmond, the Red Cross worker, called Mr. Pou on Thursday morning, he told her, ''Maria's so worried, she's going to get in the car and drive down there.'' Instead, Ms. Desmond and two co-workers drove to the Shaw home, getting repeatedly lost along DeSoto County's back roads. What they found was a tidy ranch house surrounded by uprooted pine and oak trees, its door flung open to dry damp floors and a camping trailer turned on its side in the yard. Ms. Desmond found the Shaws huddled with their six Australian shepherds in a hut in the back, where a small generator powered a fan and some lights. Ms. Desmond briskly introduced herself and handed a cellphone to Mrs. Shaw. ''We're doing fine, don't worry about us,'' Mrs. Shaw declared, leaving word on the Pou answering machine. Mr. Shaw, 69, said he had had trouble contacting his 93-year-old mother, who lives in Punta Gorda. On Monday, when the roads were finally cleared, he drove down to visit her. ''She said to me, 'Where you been all this time?''' he said. HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE MISSING"
"When structural engineers from Miami pushed the rest of Florida to adopt much stricter building codes after Hurricane Andrew, the response was generally blasé. Southeastern Florida has a much greater chance of being hit by a hurricane than the rest of the state, after all, so its experts were accused of crying wolf. ''You'd hear, 'We don't get hit with hurricanes that much,' and, 'You're much more vulnerable down there,''' said John Pistorino, an engineer and a consultant to Miami-Dade County on building codes. ''People had really let their guard down.'' The consequences are now on vivid display in coastal towns like Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte, where high winds left countless twisted heaps of wood and metal. Even as far inland as Orlando, enormous trees crashed through roofs and walls. In rural inland counties, intense gusts created so much pressure in structures that they literally exploded, as if squashed by a giant fist. Now, as southwestern and central Florida begin tallying billions of dollars in property damage from Hurricane Charley, advocates for stiffer building regulations see a golden opportunity. The powerful winds razed or badly damaged thousands of homes and other buildings, forcing Florida to conduct a re-evaluation just two years after it enacted regulations that many people considered sufficient. Under particular scrutiny are mobile homes, many of which were blown to bits despite a 1999 rule requiring stronger ''tie-downs,'' anchors that latch mobile homes to the ground. Prompted by reports of widespread shoddy construction in Miami after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Legislature adopted a statewide building code in 2001 that replaced a patchwork of county and municipal codes. The code toughened requirements on new buildings for roofing, siding and other construction components, all to reduce flying debris in a storm. New buildings must also be able to withstand wind speeds that vary by region, from 100 miles an hour inland to about 150 m.p.h. in Key West. The state code allows counties to adopt even stricter standards. But only Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, at the southeastern tip, did so. They had in fact adopted the most stringent hurricane code in the nation in 1994. Those two counties require hurricane shutters or impact-resistant windows on every residential building, as well as stronger reinforcement of roofs and walls, windows and door openings. In Charlotte County, where Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte were devastated by Hurricane Charley, new construction has to withstand winds of 120 to 130 m.p.h. Some experts have pronounced that criteria inadequate, given the 145 m.p.h. gusts last week. ''I would think the public in general would make sure that the Legislature gets tougher on the building codes now,'' said Herbert Saffir, a structural engineer in Coral Gables who helped develop the Saffir-Simpson scale that measures hurricane strength. ''People want to keep the costs down, and that's understandable. But they have to understand that really it's to their advantage to spend some more and get a safer home.'' Even before Hurricane Charley, the state was moving toward trading its rules for the International Building Code, which is more comprehensive, said Dr. Timothy Reinhold of the Institute for Business and Home Safety, an insurance industry group. The international code, however, has one glaring flaw, Dr. Reinhold said. It would allow about a quarter of the state to approve less hurricane-resistant construction than the existing code. ''The middle and upper portions of the state would suddenly be allowed to have conventional construction, the same as you would build in Atlanta or Minneapolis,'' Dr. Reinhold said. ''We raised a red flag, and we've been getting a lot of flack from builders on that.'' Gov. Jeb Bush praised the new code on Sunday at a news conference in Arcadia, saying he hoped the damage from the hurricane would obliterate any talk of lowering state standards. Raul L. Rodriguez, chairman of the Florida Building Commission, said he would recommend keeping the current wind-speed requirements if the international code was adopted. Dr. Reinhold's group is among many scrutinizing the damage this week to determine why some buildings held up and others did not. Structures built after 2002, he said, appear to have survived quite well. There are also stark lessons. Tile roofs proved a liability, as many tiles were not fastened well and became missiles. Popular aluminum pool enclosures also failed the storm's test, as did some recently installed tie-downs for mobile homes. Mr. Saffir said stronger tie-downs were no guarantee for mobile homes, which house almost 12 percent of Florida residents, according to Census Bureau data. Mr. Pistorino said that after Hurricane Andrew he urged Miami-Dade County to outlaw mobile homes but met resistance because they are among the few options for poor families and retirees on fixed incomes. In a draft report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency after that 1992 hurricane, Mr. Pistorino said, he recommended outlawing mobile homes in all the state's hurricane zones. But the agency ''felt that was a little too controversial,'' he added. ''The state says we can't exclude them because they represent affordable housing and people otherwise wouldn't be able to live here,'' Mr. Pistorino said. ''Well, my point is that the misery will be there regardless because these people are going to lose all their possessions. So I'm not sure what we're accomplishing by keeping them.'' The executive director of the Florida Manufactured Housing Association, Frank Williams, said mobile homes built after the federal government stiffened their construction rules in 1994 fared well in Hurricane Charley, even in Punta Gorda, the hardest-hit area. ''The TV cameras zeroed in on the older homes because it's better visuals,'' Mr. Williams said, adding that two people died in such homes during the storm. ''From the press accounts, you'd think every death from this thing occurred in a mobile home.'' Whether or not regulations are tightened, mobile homes are thinning in Florida, partly because of changing environmental regulations and a voracious real estate market that is enticing owners of parks for mobile homes to sell to high-end developers. The industry will lobby the Legislature not to change any rules that might increase costs, Mr. Pistorino said, as will the powerful building industry, many of whose leaders are close to Mr. Bush, a former developer himself, and to lawmakers. Builders resist stiffer codes because they increase construction costs, said Charles Danger, head of the Miami-Dade Building Department. The building lobby, he noted, persuaded Mr. Bush and the Legislature to delay enacting the new code until March 2002, almost year after they had approved it. Mr. Saffir said that using the safest materials, like impact-resistant windows, increased building costs by only 5 percent to 8 percent. Jack Glenn, technical services director for the Florida Home Builders Association, in Tallahassee, said that if anything Hurricane Charley should prompt owners of older buildings to reinforce them. The regulations from two years ago ''may require a little tweaking,'' Mr. Glenn said, ''but in general the building code has performed very well.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: REGULATIONS"
"As one of only two functioning hospitals in Charlotte County, the Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte was deluged on Thursday with more than twice its usual number of patients. All 12 emergency room beds were taken, and patients were having their wounds cleaned in the ambulance bay by members of a federal Disaster Medical Assistance Team from the Florida Panhandle. ''If it weren't for DMAT, we would have fallen on our face,'' said Alice Carper, an emergency room charge nurse. The hospital, whose top floor was ruined by the hurricane, had opened 100 of its beds on Thursday and planned to open another 50 by Friday. Throughout the areas affected by Hurricane Charley, people poured into emergency rooms, many seeking basic medical care because so many doctors' offices were closed. Others had cuts or burns from cleaning up wreckage, or flu-like symptoms that officials said were caused by the intense heat and lack of air conditioning. Eva Eickstaedt, 70, came to the Charlotte County Medical Center, clutching bloody towels to her arm. ''I cut my arm cleaning the broken glass,'' she said. But the hospital had been made uninhabitable by the hurricane, so Ms. Eickstaedt visited the field hospital set up in the medical center's parking lot by a medical assistance team. In Charlotte County, by Thursday afternoon, three medical assistance teams had treated more than 1,000 patients since the storm struck. Throughout the disaster area, there were other efforts to keep people on their feet. Health officials tested water and sewage systems, deployed stress management teams and counselors, made sure babies had formula and tried to find temporary homes for elderly people who rely on oxygen, insulin or other medical maintenance. Hospitals reported that the demand for emergency rooms had jumped about 10 percent jump, said Rich Rasmussen, a spokesman for the Florida Hospital Association. Utility companies continued rebuilding the badly battered power grid, bringing the total of residents with restored power to more than 1.5 million, according to the state Emergency Management Division. Still, more than 300,000 were still waiting for electricity. The state and the Federal Department of Agriculture announced they would give families in the affected region who use food stamps an extra month's supply. The state has attributed 23 deaths to the storm, including 12 in the aftermath from causes like carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, heart failure from stress or heat and electrocution. Gov. Jeb Bush met with insurance company executives and agriculture industry representatives. He was considering skipping the Republican National Convention in New York, where his brother will once again be nominated, a spokesman for the governor said. ''He said there's a lot of work that he needs to do here,'' said Jacob DiPietre, the spokesman. ''Everyone knows he supports his brother but depending on how things are here, he may stay in Florida.'' Charlotte County, which has the highest percentage of people 65 and older in the country, made special efforts to help them. Many were taken to the Sarasota County Fairgrounds, where the state had set up one of eight ''special needs'' shelters. Many had been placed in nursing homes or picked up by their families, and the state itself had rented a defunct nursing home in Venice, Fla., to house people. But Kay Rustic, 80, was refusing to leave the fairgrounds facility, rejecting a nursing home spot she was offered and sending her daughter, who came to help, back to Texas. She liked the hot meals and the entertainment. On Wednesday night, she said, a guitarist had conducted a sing-along, and on Thursday she ate lunch twice. ''They really treat you like you're royalty around here,'' Ms. Rustic said. Ms. Rustic, who evacuated her trailer in Port Charlotte before the storm hit on Friday, said she could not remember all the places she had been since. ''I've been in about six beds, maybe seven,'' she said. ''I'm going to stay here until they kick me out.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: COPING"
"The remnants of Hurricane Charley lashed the eastern Carolinas and Virginia with strong winds and rain on Saturday, leaving behind some damaged trees and houses but no serious flooding and none of the devastation the storm caused in Florida. After reaching the South Carolina coast with 75-mile-per-hour winds, the hurricane weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm by midafternoon. No serious injuries were reported, federal officials said. ''I think most people would say we got off light on this one,'' said Kermit Keeter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Raleigh. ''The contrast between what happened here and in Florida is amazing.'' The region had braced for a much stronger storm. Gov. Mike Easley of North Carolina declared a state of emergency on Friday, and National Guard troops were sent to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumberton to help with rescues and cleanup. The authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation in vulnerable areas of Brunswick County and on Ocracoke Island, and Sheriff L.B. Johnson of Hyde County said that by 11 a.m. Saturday all tourists had left Ocracoke, which typically has about 3,000 visitors at this time of year. About 180,000 tourists and residents fled from the Grand Strand resort area in South Carolina. The storm was still fierce when it made landfall on the South Carolina coast, having moved out to sea from Daytona Beach, Fla., late Friday. A buoy off Charlestown measured 25-foot waves at about 10 a.m., near the peak of the storm's force. Near the North Carolina border, winds gusted up to 86 m.p.h., ripping the roofs off a few houses and knocking down several hundred trees, said Steve Pfaff, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Wilmington. Utilities reported that about 108,000 customers lost power in North Carolina on Saturday, according to The Associated Press. In South Carolina, about 65,000 homes and businesses were blacked out, including 32,000 in the Charlestown area, utility officials said. Rainfall was two to four inches in the general path of the storm, Mr. Pfaff said, and up to five inches in some isolated pockets. But the widespread flood warnings issued early Saturday were withdrawn by midafternoon, he said, largely because the storm passed through the area so quickly. And the storm's fiercest winds coincided with low tide, so the storm swells never grew large enough to cause floods in coastal areas. Some residents had feared a repeat of Hurricane Floyd, which poured 20 inches of rain in North Carolina over two days in 1999, causing record floods. Tornado warnings issued early Saturday were withdrawn by the afternoon, although a tornado was reported to have damaged several cars and houses in Kitty Hawk on Saturday night. In the end, the hurricane proved less deadly in the Carolinas than did Tropical Storm Bonnie, which passed through the region on Thursday night, spawning a tornado that killed 3 people and injured 20 in Rocky Point, N.C. In Virginia, the main risk was heavy rains, weather service officials said. Officials were considering closing the Midtown Tunnel, connecting Norfolk and Portsmouth, in the event of flooding. Last September, the tunnel was closed for nearly a month after Hurricane Isabel left it badly flooded. Major highways in the region were clogged with traffic as weekenders and tourists fled the foul weather. But many expressed surprise -- and relief -- that the storm had not lived up to its deadly reputation. One group of tourists from Massachusetts even decided to keep driving to North Carolina on Saturday despite the storm. Kevin Chassie of Bellingham, Mass., said he was determined to vacation in Nags Head, N.C., even after hearing about the destruction the hurricane caused in Florida. ''We paid for the week; we're going to stick it out,'' said Mr. Chassie, who arrived in Nag's Head on Saturday. ''We decided we're going to gamble.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: UP THE COAST"
"The mobile home parks looked like they had been destroyed by wrecking crews. ''I lost everything I had,'' said Eleanor C. Jones, 78, walking as if in a daze through what remained of Harborview Park here Saturday, a day after Hurricane Charley swept through southwest Florida. ''You cannot patch up these places. They are too flimsy.'' Ms. Jones and her husband, George B. Jones, moved to this community from Maryland 16 years ago. ''It is enough to make us sit down and cry,'' said Mr. Jones, 77. ''How would you feel if everything you own was just destroyed?'' From Harborview Park in Port Charlotte to nearby Punta Gorda, two of the hardest hit places, and all along Route 17, which traces the hurricane's course northeast, mobile homes were flattened, particularly affecting retirees and the less affluent. What remained were lightweight scraps of tin and plywood piled like jackstraws a few feet deep along the roadside, crowned by tufts of faded orange insulation. Here and there, a piece of someone's life peeked out: a pink afghan, a rusty bicycle. Life was on view in other ways as well: trailers with sheared-off walls faced the road, each room displayed dollhouse-style. In some places, trailers lay one atop the other like collapsed towers of blocks. Residents picked their way through the debris, looking for anything recognizable. Harborview Park had once been lines of neat houses. On Saturday some homes stood. Others were leveled. Most had sustained serious damage. Homeowners saw a jumble of chairs, tables, curtains, windows, wires, walls, pocketbooks, clothing, drain spouts, plumbing fixtures, books, stoves and shards of glass, piled high and helter-skelter. David and Ruth Birge inspected the damage to their own home Saturday afternoon. The roof was blown off. The front porch, the carport and a shed in their backyard had been destroyed, and the house had numerous leaks. Mrs. Birge, 65, said: ''Nobody here got hurt. I am thankful for that. Things can be repaired, but lives cannot be fixed.'' ''We are alive,'' said Doris Setzler, 71, who lives nearby but was walking though, inspecting what was left of the mobile home park. ''We are fortunate, very fortunate. God put his blessing on us.'' In nearby Punta Gorda in the Crystal Lake Mobile Home Subdivision, death was more of a presence. Hurricane Charley left almost every other trailer home standing. But it did not spare the double-wide where a sickly elderly couple and their grown son decided to wait out the storm in defiance of an evacuation order. The couple's bodies were found underneath an upturned dump truck several lots away. Their son was hurled even farther, bursting through another home and embedding face-first in the back wall of a closet, neighbors said. He was taken to the hospital alive, they said. Officials said they did not yet know the son's condition. Neighbors and authorities declined to give the victims' names. The gruesome deaths devastated Crystal Lake residents who returned Saturday to inspect the damage. ''We don't know why they didn't leave,'' said Cindy Comstock, 54, the owner of the trailer where the son was found. ''It doesn't make sense. They had the money.'' Pam Alvin, 53, whose mother lives in the community, said, ''It just picked up their trailer and spun it across the road and into our work truck.'' Nothing was left of the double-wide but a concrete slab where the front porch had been. Many of those left homeless by the devastation of these communities along the Gulf of Mexico were retirees, officials said, who had settled in less expensive prefabricated structures. Trailer parks are as emblematic of Florida life as Palm Springs mansions. They are affordable for snowbirds and year-round residents, migrant workers and single parents. Many are cozy communities with their own shuffleboard courts, swimming pools, even private lakes. Authorities said 31 mobile home parks in Charlotte County sustained major damage. And on Saturday, even Floridians were questioning the state's fondness for mobile homes. One radio talk show host asked caller after homeless caller why they chose to live in them. ''I don't get this mobile home thing,'' he said. ''Is it some kind of subculture?'' One caller said he had lived in one his whole life. At Crystal Lake where Karen Hull, 50, lives with her husband, Ed, 59, she said, ''It's an affordable way of life.'' ''It's private here,'' Ms. Hull added. ''We have a private lake.'' Her 1968 mobile home was still standing, but its additions were demolished, leaving it uninhabitable. ''You have to realize,'' she said, ''that there hasn't been a storm like that in years here.'' Some thought the entire area looked like a war zone. Jennifer L. Koohns, 32, who works for a home builder, said: ''It looks as if a bomb went off here. So many houses have been demolished.'' Some telephone poles were snapped in two; others were leaning at 45 degree angles. Palm branches littered the streets, as if a giant lawn mower had sheared off the treetops. Billboards were flattened. Cars were abandoned on the roadside. Street lamps were twisted. Robert D. Thompson was nailing Styrofoam onto his mobile home to keep it from leaking. A neighbor's roof fell on his car and destroyed his carport. ''I feel sorry for other folks who lost more than I did,'' said Mr. Thompson, 73. ''As soon as I get my bearings, I am out of here, to someplace else in southwest Florida.'' Joy D. Bilbrey, 65, said she and a friend rode out the hurricane in a motor home. ''We sat in the bathroom, held on to each other and prayed very hard,'' Ms. Bilbrey said. About 40 miles south of here, in Fort Myers Beach, people waited impatiently on Saturday for the authorities to allow access to the island. ''I just want to see if my house and my business are still there,'' said Carolyn Epperson Brotka, 38, who manages a beachside restaurant called Wahoo Willies. The island lies near a body of water known as Hurricane Bay. Niri Cohen, 40, said the roof of his clothing store on Fort Myers Beach had been peeled off. ''I have property and liability insurance,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''but it does not cover wind and hurricane damage.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: STORM'S AFTERMATH"
"Twelve years ago when Hurricane Andrew slammed into Florida, killing 26 people and causing $35 billion in damage, the first President Bush was roundly criticized for acting too slowly in sending federal relief. Seemingly determined to avoid the sort of political mistakes that haunted his father, the current President Bush reacted swiftly this weekend as Florida dealt with the effects of Tropical Storm Bonnie and Hurricane Charley, the worst storm to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew. Since it became apparent that Florida, a crucial state in the presidential election, would bear the brunt of two major storms in a matter of days, Mr. Bush has made an effort to signal concern about the approaching threat and then demonstrate a capacity for immediate action. With the storm bearing down on Friday, the president issued a disaster declaration. On Saturday, the White House announced that Mr. Bush would travel on Sunday to Florida -- where his brother Jeb is governor -- to get a firsthand look at the damage and offer a shoulder to lean on as the state sought to recover from the storm. And the president took time in his campaign speech here to encourage a prayer for the storm victims and make it clear that the government was leaping into action. ''We want them to know our federal government is responding quickly,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We have aid stations in place. FEMA officials are on the ground working with state and local officials.'' In response to the hurricane, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has mounted its largest operation since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Michael Brown, the agency's director, said Saturday. The agency began moving 20 semi-trailers filled with cots and blankets, food, portable toilets, tents and other emergency supplies before the hurricane made landfall on Friday. ''They're all on the move,'' Mr. Brown said. The agency is also shipping building materials for emergency repairs. The Army Corps of Engineers arranged delivery of 10 truckloads of water and seven loads of ice to Tampa. Mr. Brown toured downtown Punta Gorda with Governor Bush on Saturday, viewing a scene of smashed buildings without power, water or telephone service in an area where cellphones have been rendered nearly useless. The perception of a slow response in time of disaster has dogged many an elected official over the years. After Hurricane Andrew, which also struck in August of a presidential election year, the first Bush administration was sharply criticized for not reacting quickly enough to the devastating storm and for refusing requests for military help. Then, when the political damage became apparent, the administration was accused of overcompensating and trying to take political advantage by pouring in money and proposing to rebuild a military base in the community battered by the storm. Democrats blocked the move, saying it was motivated by election-year politics. The experience of his father shows the balance President Bush must strike in the coming days as he grapples with tragedy in a state that decided the last presidential election and could well determine this one. Mr. Bush has to be perceived as engaged without trying to take political advantage. And he cannot be seen as getting in the way of any relief efforts during his visits. ''That is always something we take into consideration,'' the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Saturday. ''Before we go in anywhere, we make sure that doesn't happen.'' For Senator John Kerry, Mr. Bush's Democratic opponent, the situation is markedly different. Mr. Kerry does not stand to get credit or blame for the relief response in a state where recent polls have shown him leading the president. But he has to be viewed as sympathetic and free of partisanship when it comes to reacting to the storm damage, a tone he tried to strike Saturday. ''We offer our full support to the president and governor as the people of Florida rebuild their communities and their lives,'' Mr. Kerry said in a statement. ''Our thoughts and our prayers are with you today and in the difficult days ahead.'' Mr. Kerry said he did not plan to go to Florida to view the storm damage because he was concerned his entourage could distract from recovery efforts. Bush campaign aides said on Saturday that there was no political calculation in the president's actions, which they said were a part of his duties as chief executive. Scott Stanzel, a campaign spokesman, said campaign officials were not involved in the hurricane response planning. ''This is separate and apart from politics,'' he said. In contending with the hurricane from a political standpoint, Mr. Bush has to consider one factor that his father did not: his younger brother is the governor of Florida and the man many residents view as the person most responsible for returning life to normal. A strong performance by the governor could reflect well on the president and help secure the state's crucial 27 electoral votes. But if the public faults the governor's response, that could be passed on to the president as well. In the days leading up to the hurricane, the White House made it clear that the two brothers were in contact on the preparations for the storm, coordinating a strategy. The governor has appeared frequently on television to provide public guidance. In a television interview on Friday night, Representative Mark Foley, a Florida Republican, was quick to praise the governor for his take-charge demeanor. The president's father was not the last White House figure to pay a political price for performance after a weather-related tragedy. When tornadoes hit Alabama in early 2000, Vice President Al Gore, who was then seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, was sent to the state to promise federal aid and other help to the victims of the deadly twisters. But Mr. Gore's visit was later criticized as somewhat perfunctory because he did not meet with many victims and did not inspect a minority community damaged by the storm. President Bill Clinton, who was adept at such moments, returned to Alabama a few days later to console the victims. HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE PRESIDENT"
"Damage inflicted by Hurricane Charley as it ripped across the midsection of Florida on Friday and early yesterday could exceed $20 billion, making it one of the most costly storms in history, economic analysts said. Karen Clark, the chief executive of AIR Worldwide, a Boston firm that provides damage assessments for insurance companies, said some of the most severe destruction came from surging seas sweeping across the barrier islands and beaches of Florida's Gulf Coast in the vicinity of Punta Gorda as the hurricane first made landfall. But Ms. Clark and field representatives of insurance companies said Orlando, with its glistening downtown office towers, Walt Disney World and other huge theme parks, was also hit hard even though the storm's gusts were diminishing as it moved through the center of the state and skimmed past Daytona Beach on its way to the Atlantic Ocean. ''We have a swath of damage across the state,'' she said. ''Lee and Charlotte Counties on the west coast were the hardest hit. But the damage in Orlando is also significant.'' Hundreds of house trailers were destroyed in Port Charlotte and surrounding Charlotte County, said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, who is monitoring developments from New York for her trade group. Ms. Worters said that government buildings in the county suffered heavy damage and that there were reports yesterday morning that fires had broken out in the ruins of some houses near the town of Arcadia in De Soto County. She said that a hospital in Arcadia was badly damaged and that the Turner Agri-Civic Center there, where concerts and sports events had been held, was destroyed. The hurricane weakened moving into the Carolinas, and Ms. Clark estimated that it might cause several hundred million more in damages there and farther up the coast. Hurricane Charley may be the second-most devastating storm in modern times after Hurricane Andrew, which battered South Florida in 1992 at a cost of more than $25 billion. RMS, a California company that also assesses storm damage for insurance companies, estimated late Friday that the cost of Hurricane Charley to insurers would be about $5 billion. A much smaller portion of the damage of Hurricane Charley will be covered by insurance than with Andrew, industry experts said, because flooding, for which most people do not have coverage, has been more extensive in this storm and also because the insurance industry has shifted a significant portion of hurricane damage costs to homeowners, businesses and state government. Ms. Clark estimated losses to the insurance industry could be $6 billion to $10 billion in Florida. That compares with $15.5 billion in insured losses in Hurricane Andrew, which in today's dollars would come to about $20 billion. ''The biggest losses are going to be from storm surges,'' Ms. Clark said. Standard insurance policies on homes and businesses do not offer protection from flooding, and only one in four homeowners in the most likely flood areas buys the limited coverage provided by the federal government. But Floridians have been the most willing buyers of flood insurance. Forty percent of the 4.5 million flood insurance policies in America have been sold there. The federal government started providing flood insurance years ago after commercial insurers refused to, saying the only likely customers would be people who expected to suffer a loss. In such a situation, the insurers would lose the ability to spread their costs over a wide range of customers, many of whom would have no losses. When losses occurred in a larger group, they would be somewhat random. But the insurance industry began working hard to limit coverage and cut potential losses after the stunning expenses of Hurricane Andrew, which temporarily staggered some giants like State Farm and Allstate and drove some smaller insurers out of business. Now all the initial costs of a hurricane must be borne by customers along the Atlantic and Gulf Seaboard. In that huge sweep of territory, the insurers have begun imposing deductibles of 1 to 5 percent on policyholders in place of the widespread deductible of $500 that most homeowners in America choose. The result is that the owner of a $100,000 home with a 5 percent deductible pays the first $5,000 in losses rather than $500. In many cases, the insurers have also stopped covering hurricane damage along the coasts and, instead, managed to transfer the risky business to state funds. The fund in Florida charges relatively high premiums for limited coverage. Florida has also established a fund of $15 billion, partly through contributions from the insurance companies, that is intended to pay most of the insured losses over $4.5 billion. As dawn broke yesterday in Florida, hundreds of claims adjusters were making their way through the wreckage of the state, beginning detailed assessments of the damage and handing out checks for thousands of dollars to their customers for temporary living expenses and emergency repairs. They produced some of the earliest accounts of the hurricane's fierce handiwork. ''It looks bad,'' said Chris Neal, a spokesman for State Farm. He rode out the storm in his five-bedroom ranch house in Winter Haven with his wife, Laura, a claims adjuster, and their daughter, Morgan, 4, who dressed up for the event in her favorite costume, the kind of clothes worn by Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. ''There is very significant damage in Winter Haven,'' Mr. Neal said. ''We haven't had electricity since seven o'clock last night. There are lots of roofs blown off, street signs and traffic lights down. I drove past a 7-Eleven this morning and all the signs were down and the canopy over the gas pumps had collapsed. There are a lot of trees down. They can do the most significant damage.'' In Winter Haven and other central Florida towns, Mr. Neal said, most people did not have storm shutters nor did they cover their windows with plywood as South Floridians usually do when they hear a hurricane is coming. For one thing, hurricanes do not normally chop through the center of the state the way Hurricane Charley did and, for another, it did not follow its predicted route. HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE INSURANCE TOLL"
"The hurricane that hit central Florida nine days ago came sweeping off the Gulf of Mexico and smacked right into the Abundant Life Assembly of God church, shattering glass, toppling walls, scattering Scripture and raining insulation. ''It's only bricks,'' the Rev. Dennis E. Postell told the 200 or so congregants gathered Sunday morning beneath a baking tent just outside the ruined sanctuary. ''It's only mortar. It's only steel. You see, that's not the church. This is the church. The people are the church. You are the church.'' All across central Florida, along the diagonal path that Hurricane Charley carved northeast from Punta Gorda, people were gathering at battered churches to ask themselves whether nature's swirling wrath had also unsettled their faith. ''Oh, this church is going to go on, because we're a family,'' said Aida Florit, a retired telephone worker who has attended services here for nearly three years. Her mobile home is gone, she said, forcing her to live with a daughter nearby, but she plans to rebuild. At the First Baptist Church of Lake Wales, about 75 miles northeast of here, more than a half-million dollars in damage was done to buildings on its seven-acre campus. The actual church was largely spared, save for an off-kilter steeple hanging forlornly above the circular sanctuary. The Rev. Jeff McCormick, the senior pastor, gave a sermon Sunday morning titled ''When the Worst Thing Happens.'' The turnout was slightly smaller than usual for the 1,000-member congregation. ''What do you do in the dark days?'' the pastor asked. ''When the dark days come, settle in your mind that God is going to take care of you.'' Like many congregations throughout the region, including those whose buildings suffered little or no damage in the storm, First Baptist Church of Lake Wales channeled much energy into relief efforts. The church was a Red Cross shelter, played host to relief workers from the Southern Baptist Convention, and provided thousands of meals to National Guard troops, government officials, police officers, firefighters and volunteers from the Christian Contractors Association. Liz McCollough, a secretary at Lake Wales High School, explained why she came to the Sunday service. ''It helps recharge the batteries,'' Ms. McCollough said. ''God is somebody we can rely on, no matter what goes on.'' Abundant Life was not the only church here to suffer damage. The roof of Eastside Baptist Church was torn away. And Harbor Breeze Baptist was destroyed, forcing members to gather at a park shelter for a service last Sunday. But few other churches were hit as hard as Abundant Life. One of the coastal community's largest congregations, with normal Sunday gatherings of about 800 at the height of the winter season, it once sat with big, welcoming glass doors facing the sea. Now, Mr. Postell said, ''it's a bulldoze job.'' A tottering roof leaned into the cavernous sanctuary, which was scattered with hymn books and prayer request forms, a cloudless blue sky glaring through the exposed red steel girders. Several interior walls appeared ready to fall, while upstairs, in what had been the child care center, a bag of stuffed leopards rested amid layers of yellow insulation and signs reading ''Obey the Law'' and ''Live at Peace With Everyone.'' Over the sanctuary's main entrance was written ''Have You Prayed for the Service You Are About to Enter?'' while nearby, next to a pile of shattered glass, was a wind-buffeted sign made of clip-on letters that now read, ''Purcha e W dn ay Ni ht Dinner Ti k t H re.'' There is no question that the church will have to come down, Mr. Postell said, although he is getting some static about it from his insurance man. ''Don't worry, I have a good lawyer,'' the pastor whispered. Next Sunday, the worshipers will be back under the tent, but the Sunday after that they hope to be in a temporary sanctuary made up of four mobile homes out back. ''This is going to be a construction zone for a long time to come,'' Mr. Postell said. Outside, beneath the white tent, the church's minister of music, Bill Maginn, led an 8-piece band and a 16-member chorus through spiritual songs as the passing traffic on Cooper Street slowed to listen. ''Good morning, everybody,'' Mr. Maginn shouted. ''Isn't it great to be alive?'' Worshipers greeted one another with hugs and weary waves. ''How'd you make it?'' one man asked. ''We did all right,'' was the reply. The shattered sanctuary's roof line was clearly visible in shadow on the tent's white roof. ''We're here just to help clean up, help do whatever we can,'' said Ken Geci, who drove all night with his preacher and a crew of ''three gals and five guys'' from the Rock Family Worship Center in Huntsville, Ala. ''We've got five days and some chain saws, and we'll do whatever needs doing.'' Fay Price, who used to live in Buffalo and spend winters in the region, moved here full time five years ago and began attending services at Abundant Life simply because it had the same name as her church up north. ''When we pulled up the other day and saw what had happened to the church, we thought, oh my,'' said Ms. Price, cooling herself with a hand-held fan. ''But God knows best. He has plans, bigger and better than we ever thought.'' Mr. Postell told his sweaty congregation not to despair, though even he broke down once after reading from Psalms 91 -- ''Ye shall not be afraid of the terror by night'' -- and wondered about all the work to be done and the shattered lives to be mended. ''What the Devil means for bad, the Lord means for good,'' he said. ''And I've got a message for the Devil this morning: We're going to come back, and when we come back, we'll be twice as strong.''"
"With experts predicting that it will take at least months and probably well over a year for southwest and central Florida to recover from Hurricane Charley, disaster relief agencies are beginning to confront one of their most difficult problems: finding long-term housing for thousands of displaced residents. Though authoritative estimates of the number of people left homeless are not yet available, a preliminary assessment by the American Red Cross shows that more than 31,000 residential buildings were destroyed or made uninhabitable by the storm. A small number of the displaced have already left the area or found permanent housing, officials said. And some of those buildings were winter homes for Northern snowbirds. But the storm has forced thousands of Floridians to live with friends and relatives, in motels or shelters, in their cars or even in the skeletal remains of their homes. Those people will soon need more permanent shelter while they wait for homes to be rebuilt or while they seek new apartments, relief officials and housing industry experts said. ''This is a long-term thing,'' said Douglas Buck, director of government affairs for the Florida Home Builders Association. ''You're talking at least the end of the year for most people, and for some people, longer.'' The first alternative for most displaced people is rental apartments, officials said. But housing experts said that there was a shortage of vacant units before the hurricane and that it had been worsened by storm damage. Federal officials said they had identified 1,500 available units, but private relief officials said they did not believe that would be enough. ''There just isn't much housing stock,'' said Larry Koslick, deputy director of relief operations for the American Red Cross. Government and private agencies are scrambling to create alternatives, including trucking in thousands of mobile homes, moving people to other counties and opening long-term shelters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for instance, has ordered 8,000 mobile homes and travel trailers to provide temporary shelter. The agency is also building a temporary trailer park in Charlotte County for storm victims, officials said Sunday. Nearly 400 trailers or mobile homes have been installed at the park, which can hold 2,000 units. But some relief officials said it could take several months for enough mobile homes to reach the area because most of the 8,000 units had yet to be built. FEMA officials said they would be produced at a rate of 100 per day starting this week. The Red Cross and the agency also plan to open long-term ''transitional'' shelters for people who are expected to need emergency housing for several months. Those shelters will provide more privacy than the emergency shelters, where residents typically get a cot in a huge open room. The problem has been most severe for low-income people, officials and experts said. In Punta Gorda, one of the worst-hit towns, the storm ravaged most of the public housing, leaving only 29 of 184 units habitable. More than 300 people on welfare or fixed incomes are facing long-term displacement, officials said. Jean Farino, director of the Punta Gorda Housing Authority, said that housing authorities in other counties might take a handful of those residents, but that most were facing an uncertain future. Ms. Farino said it could take more than two years to rebuild the damaged housing projects. ''I don't know what we're going to do,'' she said. ''They have nothing. These are the poorest of the poor.'' Gayle Reen, 59, is one of those people. A former nurse who is on disability because of heart and back problems, she lost her apartment in a Punta Gorda public housing project because of the hurricane. Ms. Reen plans to apply for public housing in other counties but has been given no guarantees. For now, she expects to live in a Red Cross shelter, a situation that brings her to tears, she said. With a fixed monthly income of $1,000, she said she could afford rent of $250, about half of what she thought a low-cost apartment would run. ''Please find me an apartment for $250 a month,'' she said. ''It doesn't exist.'' The extent of the storm's destructiveness is becoming clear in statistics that have been released in recent days. The insurance industry has estimated that it will pay $7.4 billion for damage claims, making Hurricane Charley the second-most-costly storm in American history, behind Hurricane Andrew in 1992. FEMA has received more than 41,000 applications for housing assistance, which includes requests for home-repair grants, rental aid and temporary shelter. And the Red Cross assessment shows that in some counties, from a fifth to a half of residential buildings were severely damaged. Still, experts said, Hurricane Charley was less devastating than Hurricane Andrew. After that storm, some residents lived in mobile homes for more than two years while they waited for new housing. -------------------- Counties Begin Return to Normal (By The New York Times), SARASOTA, Fla., Aug. 23 -- Although electricity had returned by Monday to most areas hit by the storm, 775 people were still living in 16 shelters in nine counties, said Erin Geraghty, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Most of the region's hospitals had returned to service by Monday, Ms. Geraghty said. State officials said 25 people had died as a result of the storm. Progress Energy and Florida Power and Light reported that by Monday nearly all service had been restored. But only 60 percent of Charlotte County and 57 percent of DeSoto County had power."
"The young woman was fuming when she approached Gov. Jeb Bush last week, complaining that the coastal towns where Hurricane Charley had blown in days earlier were basking in aid and attention while hard-hit rural areas languished and her mother, who needed dialysis, suffered in a flooded home. ''In the first 24 hours there just wasn't anything done here in terms of help,'' the woman, Jennifer Grant, said about her hometown, Arcadia, where the hurricane wrecked the business district, took hundreds of old trees and tore the roof off a shelter. But after Mr. Bush put his arm around her shoulder, gently teased about her bluster (she had tried to interrupt his news conference) and promised that every crippled region would get equal treatment -- ''I wanted them to come out here because this is as important a part of the state as anyplace else,'' he told her, sweeping his hand toward a knot of reporters following him -- she softened and asked to shake his hand. So went many an encounter with Florida's high-profile governor as he continually traveled the storm's path, offered detailed progress reports and proclaimed, ''We're here to help.'' There is nothing like a disaster to provide a defining moment for a chief executive, testing his leadership and altering his legacy for the better -- consider Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York after the 2001 terrorist attacks -- or worse. And for Governor Bush, a younger brother of President Bush, the test comes at a critical moment. With a national election less than three months away, he is under intense pressure to deliver a wider margin of victory for his brother in Florida than in 2000, when George Bush won by a mere 537 votes after a recount and court ruling. That prospect appeared to be flagging in the weeks leading up to the storm, partly because of accusations that the governor was trying to fix the election for his brother. A state list of people believed to be convicted felons, sent to elections supervisors to help them remove such people from the voting rolls, was scrapped under heavy criticism last month after newspaper investigations revealed that it left out almost all Hispanics, who tend to vote Republican. Mr. Bush was also fending off attacks on the new touch-screen voting systems that Florida's most populous counties will use in November, and distancing himself from a flier that the Republican Party had paid for, which denounced computerized voting and encouraged voters in South Florida to use absentee ballots. But the storm all but snuffed out newspaper articles about Florida's electoral problems ahead of the state primary on Aug. 31. It also eclipsed a legal blow last week to Mr. Bush's beloved but controversial school voucher program, and silenced critics who had been ripping into him all summer. Even some newspaper columnists and editorial boards often critical of the governor have praised his response to the storm, a rarity for a man whose actions frequently stir controversy. ''The hurricane will bring the governor political peace in the near term,'' said David Niven, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University. ''It's essentially a requirement of the job that he focus on the hurricane, but it also has political dividends that he's very well aware of.'' In particular, Mr. Bush's appearances across Central Florida last week could not but help his brother, who is eager to capture swing voters along the Interstate 4 corridor between Tampa and Daytona Beach. Though the Orlando area was not as badly hit as Charlotte County on the Gulf Coast, he made several visits there last week and to the state's rural and suburban midsection, regions that are more up for grabs than the solidly Republican southwestern coast. More than once, he visited heavily Hispanic areas that are considered to be rich with swing voters, occasionally comforting storm victims in fluent Spanish. These areas went for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential race, but also heavily supported Governor Bush for re-election in 2002, making Republicans think they have a good shot there in November. Yet the governor did not limit his appearances to vote-rich areas. Most of his visits to storm victims were in small towns in rural counties like Polk, DeSoto and Hardee, some of which have more citrus trees or livestock than people. Jim Kane, director of Florida Voter, a nonpartisan political news and polling service, said the governor's attention to sparsely populated regions showed that his priority was to soothe the shaken and displaced. ''He's going to where the devastation had a deep effect on people's lives,'' Mr. Kane said. ''He looked like he was in command, taking action. When you do that as governor, you do well.'' By midweek, the president and three of his cabinet members -- Tommy G. Thompson, the health and human services secretary; Elaine L. Chao, the labor secretary; and Tom Ridge, the homeland security secretary -- had visited the hurricane zone and promised financial assistance. And Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was at Governor Bush's side for much of the week, orchestrating the agency's largest mobilization since the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. ''You can ask the governor whether or not he's satisfied with how fast the aid is moving,'' President Bush told reporters during his visit on Sunday, his brother, who had no complaints, at his side. Indeed, money has already poured, or been designated to pour, into the region: Florida's Department of Community Affairs sent $4.5 million in emergency block grants for small cities and $100,000 to aid farm workers. Its Department of Elder Affairs announced $5 million in emergency aid. Governor Bush offered emergency state loans for storm victims and said he would back a plan to set aside some state sales tax revenue to rebuild damaged communities, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency swiftly began writing checks to the temporarily homeless. By Wednesday, the governor had decided to skip the Republican National Convention in New York City to focus on hurricane recovery efforts. Even before the storm, Governor Bush, who swats away questions about his aspirations for higher office, intended to keep a low profile at the convention. The governor had not requested or been assigned a formal role at the convention, even though Florida, the fourth-most-populous state, is again a crucial battleground. Friends and even adversaries say the governor, 51, is far more in his element demonstrating his wonky, superorganized approach to governing with prompt attention to citizen needs. ''A convention is a publicity free-for-all and that's not necessarily his favorite environment, because it's not the place for good debate or discourse or action,'' said Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a friend of Mr. Bush. ''Given his druthers, he would prefer to be at work.''"
"Sometime later today, the storm called Charley -- long since downgraded from hurricane status -- will lose its tropical identity in a frontal system somewhere off the east coast of Canada. But that storm has already entered the books as the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the 21st century -- and the worst and most expensive since Hurricane Andrew thrashed South Florida in 1992. Damage costs could exceed the $20 billion mark, and the death toll could approach that of Andrew, in which 26 people died. Charley was a brutal reminder of the power of hurricanes -- the steamrolling winds, the storm-spawned tornadoes, the deluge of horizontal rains. These days a tropical storm is watched from the instant of its birth and tracked with an astonishing array of meteorological tools. In most cases, that gives residents in the storm's path enough time to make careful preparations and to evacuate. That can often help blunt the damage a hurricane causes, though not, of course, its actual impact. But Charley was also a reminder that the volatility of hurricanes is every bit as dangerous as their brute force. In the hours before it came ashore on the west coast of Florida, the storm jumped in wind velocity. It also took a more southerly track across the midsection of the state, passing farther south of Tampa than meteorologists had predicted. The storm may have caused as much damage as it did in part because the residents of Charlotte, Lee and De Soto Counties took the forecasters too literally at their word. Charley roared down upon a world of mobile homes -- always susceptible to storm damage -- but it also roared down upon towns and neighborhoods that had not prepared for the storm as carefully as counties farther north. A long, active hurricane season lies ahead of us. The tropical storms are lining up one after another, and experts predict that there's a very good chance this season may see some six to eight hurricanes, two to four of which could be major. Charley should remind us that nature is almost as hard to predict as it is to control."
"When Hurricane Charley hit the Florida Coast, the disaster posed the biggest challenge for the Federal Emergency Management Agency since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the first test of the agency's ability since it was absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA itself did not win public confidence for its response to the World Trade Center attacks when the agency, whose role until then had been responding to accidents and natural disasters, was criticized as being too slow to dole out money and its workers were accused of being rude and condescending. In its new home within Homeland Security, the agency is part of a larger organization whose prime concern is not natural disasters but terrorism, raising the possibility that its bread-and-butter mission would languish. But accounts from the local officials who work with FEMA and from victims of Hurricane Charley say the overall governmental response to the storm -- in which FEMA played a large role -- was good. Asked what else the outside world could send him, Craig Fugate, the Florida emergency director, said, ''a time machine.'' ''We've got stuff, everything from food and water and ice,'' he said. Jaci Honious, sitting outside the Disaster Relief Center in Port Charlotte, Fla., with her Yorkshire terrier, Tinker, on Friday, said, ''Everywhere I've gone, somebody is handing out food or water.'' As Ms. Honious, a hospital X-ray technician, spoke, a state employee asked if the dog needed water. No, Ms. Honious said, Tinker just had some. Ms. Honious, 56, has moved in with her parents because most of her apartment is now open to the sky. She spoke to FEMA and was told to file a claim with her insurance company first. ''My concern,'' she continued, ''is in three to five weeks down the road. Are these people going to go away? Are we going to have homes?'' Just then a Red Cross worker came by and asked if Tinker would like some beef stew. ''No, she just ate,'' Ms. Honious said. FEMA began moving supplies to Florida even before a disaster was declared, which it did not do for Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The agency said it had more than 2,600 people or businesses register for aid on the first day, compared with 528 for Andrew, and registrations passed 100,000 on Day 8, compared with Day 28 for Andrew. The first checks for housing were approved on Day 1, versus Day 6 for Andrew. On Olympia Street in downtown Port Charlotte, Donna Schlichting drove her minivan through a Comfort Station, where a soldier from the Army National Guard of Deland, Fla., motioned her between the orange cones marking lanes in a parking lot of a mostly destroyed shopping center. ''What do you need?'' asked Sgt. Mario Guerrero. ''Water, ice and a tarp,'' Ms. Schlichting replied. ''We're out of tarps,'' the sergeant replied. But two soldiers loaded two cases of water and two big bags of ice into the back of her van. Sergeant Guerrero said that at one point the Guard had also given out baby rattles to cranky children in the cars. ''Somebody donated them,'' he said with a shrug. ''Emergency experts around the country say that an increasingly formalized relationship among them has apparently paid off in the Hurricane Charley effort, with a system of conference calls and e-mail messages that have been used to share state resources and federal ones. Public safety is primarily a local responsibility. ''All disasters are local,'' said Chris Reynolds, who teaches a course in emergency preparedness at the American Public University System, an online learning institution. Mr. Reynolds said the role of FEMA was to fill in when a challenge was more than local officials could manage, and that in this case the agency appeared to have done well. The assessment of government's performance is always liable to political coloring, and this one is different from Andrew, when the governor was of a different political party from the president and also not his brother. And Florida's political importance nationally could be crucial. ''If you are going to be in a natural disaster, make sure it's in a swing state during an election year,'' wrote Jim DeFede, a columnist at The Miami Herald, on Thursday. Disaster aid has always had an element of public relations, said John B. Copenhaver, who headed the southeastern FEMA region during the Clinton administration. ''Sometimes media has a role, focusing a lot of attention on places with highly visible damage,'' he said. ''You want to make sure you've got plenty of people wearing FEMA jackets or shirts in that area,'' he said. The recovery's success will not be clear for years. One of the late realizations about Hurricane Andrew was that big businesses recovered by relying on their national resources, and small business did not. Mr. Fugate, the Florida emergency manager, said that the state would try to rely on local business as soon as possible. As hotels and motels and restaurants reopen, he said, he will shut down military-style base camps and cafeteria lines, and as stores reopen, the state will shop there instead of bringing in supplies from outside. ''In all our plans, we never forget, if there's no jobs we didn't recover,'' he said. The federal agency has a tough challenge, said Todd Wetsel, the director of the Center for Hazards Research and Policy Development at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. ''Historically it seems like after a large-scale event, people always talk in halls of government about reorganizing FEMA because it didn't do what people think it ought to do,'' he said. ''The problem is with a mismatch of expectations.'' FEMA cannot be ''a superagency that can be writing checks and bandaging wounds,'' he added. Correction: August 31, 2004, Tuesday An article on Thursday about the response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Hurricane Charley misidentified the director of the Center for Hazards Research and Policy Development at the University of Louisville, who said, ''Historically, it seems like after a large-scale event, people always talk in the halls of government about reorganizing FEMA because it didn't do what people think it ought to do'' and who added that FEMA could not be ''a superagency that can be writing checks and bandaging wounds.'' The director is Prof. David Simpson. The speaker cited erroneously was a communications specialist at the university, and his surname was misspelled. He is Todd Wetzel, not Wetsel."
"In spinning up from a relatively unremarkable Category 2 storm to the extreme Category 4 level in just five hours yesterday, Hurricane Charley illustrated the limits that still dog hurricane forecasting. John L. Beven, a hurricane specialist at the national Hurricane Center in Miami, said the storm's explosive development was ''extremely unusual'' and, for the moment at least, inexplicable. Yesterday morning, the center had predicted that the storm would strike Florida as a Category 2.But then something happened over the Gulf of Mexico 100 miles south of Fort Myers, Fla., Dr. Beven said -- possibly some extra pulse of energy from warm gulf waters, some shift in winds that might otherwise hinder the storm, or some chaotic change in the walls of clouds around its eye. The changes occurred at a pace rarely seen in such giant swirling storms. The forecast at 11 A.M. was for the storm to strike Florida with winds of 100 miles an hour. By 2 p.m., the fresh forecast put the anticipated winds at landfall at 125 miles an hour. By 3:50 p.m., the storm's tightly wound core was shredding Florida's west coast with sustained winds of 145 miles an hour, just 10 miles an hour below that of a Category 5 storm, the most destructive. Meteorologists have become adept at predicting the path of such giant storms, integrating measurements of winds and variations in atmospheric pressure that nudge them, accelerate them or slow them. But they say mistakes in judging intensity are still common because of a lack of measurements of factors like water temperature; momentary vagaries of atmospheric conditions in a storm's path; and the complicated physics in the milling thunderstorms at a hurricane's pulsing heart. The result is often a last-minute scramble to judge a storm's destructive potential. Sometimes, storms can weaken just as abruptly as this one strengthened. In October 2002, for example, Hurricane Lili roared toward Louisiana at Category 4 strength and then abruptly dropped to Category 2 as it struck land. For most storms, there is a dearth of data that could help shape forecasts. Another limit is a lack of data on temperatures beneath the surface of waters ahead of an approaching hurricane. A hurricane can pull cold water to the surface, rapidly stifling its own growth by turning off the flow of energy from warm-water evaporation, experts say. Satellites constantly monitor the sea's surface temperatures but cannot determine the temperatures of deeper layers. Last summer, as part of a research project, Hurricane Fabian and Hurricane Isabel were tracked in part using data transmitted from buoys dropped into the sea in their path that could monitor water temperature below the surface. No such buoys were deployed this time, Dr. Beven said. Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said that a lack of detailed monitoring of the behavior of hurricanes far from shore limited understanding of how storms might go through abrupt cycles of intensifying and weakening. For yesterday's intensifying hurricane, Dr. Beven said, ''things must have come together just right.'' ''We'll be doing considerable research here to figure out what happened,'' he said, adding that the analysis would take months. HURRICANE CHARLEY: FORECASTING"
"Dorothy L. Martin has lived here for 28 of her 51 years, but never felt compelled to leave her home until Friday, when she took shelter in a high school gymnasium with more than 800 other people fleeing Hurricane Charley. Ms. Martin, who has a canal in the backyard of her first-floor apartment, was not just fleeing the storm. Alligators sent her packing. ''The water will be at the door,'' she said. ''I would not want to be sucked up and spinning around with the big gators.'' As the hurricane veered toward Fort Myers on Friday afternoon, pelting the area with sheets of heavy rain, people streamed into the gymnasium of Dunbar High School, one of many shelters operated by the American Red Cross. The gym looked like a combination of a summer camp, a day care center and a nursing home. The temporary residents were a melting pot of American life: migrant workers, homeless people, affluent homeowners, schoolteachers, retirees, pregnant women, crying babies and children of all ages, all crammed in with barely enough room to stretch their legs. ''Scoot in as close to your neighbor as you can,'' a Red Cross worker told them. They had trekked into the shelter with blankets, pillows, sleeping bags, mattresses, folding chairs, bottled water, popcorn, candy and other snacks. Some families brought books but found themselves unable to read when the lights went out in the windowless gym because of a local power failure at 3:30 p.m. Despite the darkness, the close quarters and the heat, Victor B. Carter, a member of the board of the Lee County chapter of the Red Cross, said: ''This is the best place for people to be. It's awesome. We have a great diversity of people -- Haitians, blacks, whites and Hispanics -- with great disparities. We are all trying to work together, trying to find a place to be safe.'' Leslie A. Yanigan, 42, who lives in nearby Cape Coral, threw some items into her van and raced to the shelter with her three children after the winds began to howl at 1:30 p.m. ''We went out for a bicycle ride at 8:30 this morning, and it was gorgeous,'' she said. ''We did not believe the hurricane would hit us, so we did not think about boarding up the house.'' Her daughter, Lexi Braun, 19, said no one was on the road when they fled. ''It felt like a post-apocalypse moment,'' she said. Ms. Braun said: ''We are middle class, but some of the people here are homeless. In a disaster like this, the shelter serves everyone.'' A 58-year-old woman who gave only her first name, Patricia, said she and her husband live in a car. ''The shelter will be safer than the car,'' she said. At other times, she said, ''it is hard to find a place to spend the night because the police knock on the window of our car and tell us that we have to move.'' Helen F. Christiansen came to the shelter from her home in Bokeelia, on Pine Island on the Gulf Coast. The local authorities had ordered evacuation of the island. ''The area where I live is about six inches above sea level,'' said Ms. Christiansen, who feared that storm-whipped waters would flood her home. ''I have never before been in a hurricane.'' Edward C. Lynch, 59, said he had flown into Fort Myers on Thursday looking for a retirement home. He did not expect to spend the night in a shelter, but he was not worried. ''I rode out a hurricane on a destroyer in the Atlantic in 1965,'' Mr. Lynch said. Children seemed to enjoy the shelter experience more than adults. They saw it as an adventure, an outing, a chance to make new friends, and adults tried to make the most of a bad situation for them. Anna M. Liakas, 44, organized board games for children, including her son and daughter. When squalls roared through town around 2:30 Friday morning, she said, ''I got really nervous because I knew that was mild'' compared with the hurricane churning north toward Florida. Before leaving home, Ms. Liakas said, she put plywood over the windows of her house, a Colonial built in the 1920's. Chip Withrow, 38, a sixth-grade teacher, read books to his 2-year-old daughter. Before coming to the shelter, he took in lawn furniture, garbage cans and a barbecue grill at his home so they would not be destroyed. Marisol Ponce, 16, came to the shelter at 6 a.m. on Friday with her mother and father, her brother and sister, a baby nephew -- and seven other Mexican-American families. ''People are friendly, nice and calm,'' Ms. Ponce said. ''Mom and Dad came here because they wanted to protect us.'' Robert L. Shorkey, his wife and their three children are planning to leave Fort Myers for a new home in the St. Louis area in two days. ''I had plywood boards for the house here, but threw them away two weeks ago because I felt sure we would never need them,'' Mr. Shorkey said. ''If there is any question about whether we should stay in Florida, the answer is an absolute no.'' Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, expressed a slightly different view in a news conference on Friday morning. ''One of the few downsides of living in paradise is that God gives us hurricanes from time to time,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But it is still paradise.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: RESPONSE"
"A ferocious hurricane packing winds of 145 miles an hour ripped into Florida's west coast on Friday, leaving a half million people without power, flipping roofs off houses, blowing out hospital windows and peeling brick walls from their frames. A 15-foot storm surge followed in its wake. Hurricane Charley, the most intense storm to hit Florida since Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida in 1992 and the worst on the west coast of Florida in at least a century, prompted state and local officials to order the evacuation of nearly two million people all along the heavily populated coast. The storm screamed through Charlotte Harbor, about 90 miles south of Tampa, and headed straight for Orlando, slightly weakened but still at hurricane strength. It spared the densely populated Tampa Bay area, full of modern high-rises and waterfront condos, which had expected to be hardest hit. By early evening, Florida officials estimated the property damage to be $14.5 billion and attributed another $2.3 billion in losses to business interruptions. The officials estimated that 377,000 buildings were damaged. Officials in various counties said they had heard reports of injuries but the state emergency management office said it was still compiling figures. Before the storm hit Florida, three people were reported killed in Cuba. Schools, universities, airports, SeaWorld and Disney World closed, the Kennedy Space Center sent employees home early, and passenger train service between Miami and New York was canceled. Tornado warnings were issued for south-central Florida, and the storm drenched ground already saturated by recent rains, increasing the risk of floods. At the request of Gov. Jeb Bush, President Bush declared the region a federal disaster area. At one point Governor Bush said the damage could exceed $15 billion, but he became more optimistic after the hurricane missed the Tampa area. ''There will be ramifications for this for many families in our state for months ahead,'' he said. ''And we are going to be prepared to provide support.'' As the storm advanced, traveling faster than 20 m.p.h., eastern Florida residents made preparations while those on the west coast were already assessing the damage. Residents who lived in mobile homes or prefabricated homes and in low-lying areas were evacuated. In Orlando, three out of the five shelters in local schools were closed to newcomers because they were full, officials said. On the Saffir-Simpson scale, used by meteorologists to denote hurricane strength, Hurricane Charley was rated a Category 4 when it made landfall. A Category 4 hurricane has sustained winds of 131 to 155 m.p.h. As the storm hit La Costa Island, west of Fort Myers, about 3:45 p.m., sheets of rain wiped out any visibility and lawns turned into ponds, but the worst damage came from high winds. Waves tossed boats as if they were made of balsa wood, and small planes were flipped. The howling wind could be heard inside shelters where residents hunkered down, waiting for the worst to pass. ''It's something like you've never heard before,'' said Matt Rechkemmer, the 911 coordinator for Lee County, where Fort Myers is located. ''It's a constant whining sound, it's sustained, to the point where it just doesn't even seem real. I've been in Lee County for 20 years and I've never heard winds and seen rain like that before.'' Hurricane Charley sheared the roof from a shelter where 1,200 had sought safety. It stole the door from a nursing home in Port Charlotte, and Charlotte County's emergency operations center had to decamp to a jail. An overturned fire truck was another indication of the hurricane's might. The center of the hurricane passed near Orlando around 10 p.m. with sustained winds of about 90 m.ph., according to the National Hurricane Center near Miami. At 11 p.m. the storm was near Daytona Beach and was expected to be near or over the South Carolina coast by morning. A hurricane warning was in effect from Cocoa Beach, Fla., to Oregon Inlet in North Carolina. A state of emergency was declared in North Carolina and South Carolina as rainfall of 3 to 6 inches was expected along the storm's path. The hurricane center forecast that Hurricane Charley would continue along the coast, weakening to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 39 to 73 m.p.h. by Saturday night. It could pass near New York City on Sunday, and by Sunday night, near Maine, the storm was expected to be a tropical depression, with winds below 39 m.p.h. The Florida National Guard activated 5,000 troops, saying it expected the destruction to approach that of Hurricane Andrew, which caused $25 billion in damage and killed more than 60 people. The Guard deployed special teams trained in policing and security, as well as search and rescue and humanitarian aid. During an early evening news conference, Governor Bush described the storm as devastating. ''People on the east coast as well as central Florida need to take this storm very, very seriously,'' he said. ''These winds will be Category 2 winds by the time they reach central Florida. Those are still powerful winds.'' Hurricane Charley screamed across Cuba early Friday, ripping apart roofs, yanking up huge palm trees and killing three people. Throughout much of the morning it appeared to be heading straight for Tampa Bay. But then the storm turned abruptly to the east, sending people in Charlotte and Lee Counties scurrying into shelters. The storm was the second to hit Florida in just over 24 hours. The first, Tropical Storm Bonnie, was less severe than expected, but spun off tornadoes Friday that killed three in North Carolina and injured more than two dozen. Perhaps because of the memory of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, officials said, many of the 1.9 million residents who were urged to flee the coast heeded the call, filling area hotels and shelters. On Madeira Beach near St. Petersburg, plywood covering a business window was spray-painted with the words, ''Sorry Charlie, We've Gone Home.'' Over all, officials said some 45,000 people took refuge in public shelters. There were, of course, some holdouts. Carl and Betty Wieczorek live on Pass-a-Grille Beach near St. Petersburg, an island that was thought to have been wiped out in 1921 after the last bad storm, an unnamed Category 3 hurricane, hit Tampa Bay. It was a few days before boaters found it was still there. But the Wieczoreks are newcomers to Florida, and said they did not have the money to go to a hotel and did not want to go to a shelter because their Doberman pinscher and parrot would not be allowed. Most of all, the Wieczoreks said, they did not want to leave their uninsured collectibles. ''We've got thousands of antiques that we haven't even unboxed yet,'' Mr. Wieczorek said. ''I figure if the water comes in and we're here, we can at least lift things up to keep them from getting wet.'' In Punta Gorda on Charlotte Harbor, Susan Evans decided not to leave her 1920's wood-frame house despite a mandatory evacuation in her area. ''They told me I was required to leave, and when I told them I was staying, they asked me to name my next of kin,'' she said. ''That really freaked me out.'' After spending two hours of the storm in her bedroom closet, underneath a queen-size mattress, she said she would never make that mistake again. ''I felt like the house was lifting me,'' Ms. Evans said. ''I didn't think anything could lift like that.'' When she emerged to inspect the damage, she saw that two of her palm trees had been uprooted, and the second floor of the house across the street had been demolished. At the nearby Temple Bar, Kevan Doyle, the owner, continued to serve beer throughout the storm, even after the second-floor roof collapsed and tankards and pitchers were set out to catch the leaks. By Friday evening, his only customers were storm chasers who had sought out Hurricane Charley with their video cameras. Still, even places that did not feel the brunt of the storm remained on high alert. Tampa General Hospital canceled all elective surgeries, brought in extra staff and stopped accepting new patients, said John Dunn, a hospital spokesman. ''We were bracing for storm surge of 14 to 16 feet, so our collective blood pressure has dropped considerably,'' Mr. Dunn said. A storm surge is the difference between normal high tide and the storm tide. In Pinellas County, horse owners evacuated their mounts to a county park on high ground. More than 50 horses waited out the storm, grazing around swing sets and picnic pavilions. Welch Agnew, assistant director of Pinellas County Animal Services, said animal specialists learned from Hurricane Andrew that stables can be more hazardous than helpful in a hurricane. ''Most stables are less secure than a mobile home,'' he said. ''In an open field, the horse will turn its rear to the storm, and ride it out.'' In Arcadia, about 40 miles from the coast, residents emerged after the storm to watch a golden sunset. Arcadia is a small town with century-old oak trees, antique shops and ice cream parlors lining Oak Street downtown, and old-fashioned wood-framed homes. It feels historic in a state where most everything is new. But Arcadia lost much of its history when the hurricane hit on Friday, clearing away trees, battering proud buildings so badly that their bricks spilled into the streets and shocking residents who thought living inland made them safe. Robert Van Kempen, 68, weathered the storm in the 100-year-old Heritage Baptist Church. When the stained glass windows shattered, he and the others moved to a small concrete room in the back. ''It was very scary. Once you go through this, you don't want to go through it again,'' Mr. Van Kempen said. ''We were huddled together, we didn't know each other, but we were huddled together for dear life.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE OVERVIEW"
"As Tropical Storm Bonnie drenched the Florida Panhandle, the state prepared on Thursday for that storm's more powerful pursuer, Hurricane Charley, which is expected to be the fiercest storm to hit the Tampa Bay since 1921. By Thursday evening, 1.9 million people in vulnerable areas along the west coast of Florida had been told to evacuate -- the largest evacuation in Tampa Bay's history, an emergency management official said -- as the hurricane trampled the edge of Cuba, skirted the Keys, and weighed in off the Gulf Coast, gathering strength. The hurricane had been expected to make landfall Friday morning, but as Thursday afternoon progressed, forecasters estimated that landfall would occur around 8 p.m. on Friday. At the same time, its expected landing point moved steadily northward, from the Keys to the Tampa area, with a hurricane watch extending as far north as the Suwanee River above Cedar Key, a vulnerable outcropping of the Gulf Coast. For officials, the biggest worry was informing a public unaccustomed to storms. ''It's the largest storm to hit the Tampa area in quite some time,'' Erin Geraghty, a State Division of Emergency Management spokeswoman, said. ''We don't want folks to get too comfortable. We get a lot of new residents in this state, I think we get 600 or 800 folks a day.'' On Clearwater Beach, Frenchy's Rockaway Grill was closing up shop as the police trawled for stragglers. ''Hurricanes always hit on the east coast. They hit like Louisiana,'' said April Coulter, 21, a waitress. ''But we never have one in the Tampa Bay. That's why everyone's freaking out.'' Tampa's streets filled with testy drivers, and its stores were jammed with shoppers looking for last-minute supplies. At the Kash n' Karry Supermarket on Swann Avenue, the manager awaited a fresh truckload of bottled water. ''There's no water, but I got beer,'' said Lisa Torres, 33, a teacher. On Wednesday, fearing the double blow of the tropical storm and the hurricane, Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency and called out the National Guard. On Thursday, some 500 troops mustered at the Tampa armory to await orders, said Jon Myatt, spokesman for the Florida Department of Military Affairs. He said they would be deployed to flooded areas to provide security. The tropical storm was milder than expected, bringing less than six inches of rain on Apalachicola and Mexico Beach and causing no major flooding, Ms. Geraghty said. By late afternoon, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. But the hurricane's winds inched past 105 miles an hour, making it at least a Class 2 hurricane; it was expected to attain Class 3 by the time it reached land. The last time a storm of that level hit near Tampa was in 1921, said Hugh Cobb, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center. Peter Teahen, a spokesman for the American Red Cross, said the agency had opened 10 shelters away from the coast, ''but that number could soar dramatically.'' The ones now open accommodate about 15,000 people, he said. Mr. Teahen said that those affected could call 866-GET-INFO to find out where to go. Also, he said, in the Atlanta area the organization had ''34 emergency response vehicles staged and ready to go to move into Florida, and 20 more coming in from Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri'' to provide food and emergency services after the storms had passed."
"''Life goes a lot better in Florida with electricity,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said on Saturday, a day after Hurricane Charley struck, as he toured downtown Punta Gorda, where decapitated utility poles left electric cables at an altitude of four feet, making it difficult to cross U.S. 41. But five days after the storm, on both the east coast of Florida and the southwest, more than 400,000 customers remained without power. There is no electricity to run the refrigerator, and people can get sick from eating spoiled food. There is no electricity to run the pumps at the bottom of wells, so there is no potable water. There is no electricity to charge up cellphone batteries, to run cash registers and A.T.M.'s and gasoline pumps. And there is no power for something as simple as a fan, to keep the heat at bay. So Rosangel Araujo, 33, who said she had been living with her mother because her own apartment was nearly destroyed in the hurricane, cooks outside by starting fires in concrete blocks and putting pots with rice and beans on the fires. Ms. Araujo said she had seen electrical workers in the neighborhood and she believed that they were making a good effort to restore the power. But she said, ''For me it's not fast enough.'' Neissa Juan, 43, said she had four children living in her house, ages 7 to 12. Two of them are nieces and nephews and two are her twin boys. And without electricity, she said, ''Inside it is like an oven.'' She said she had been told that it would be at least a week and probably longer before her power was restored. It is not for lack of trying, utility officials say. In the days since Saturday, hundreds of thousands of customers had their power turned back on. Crews from as far away as Texas and Wisconsin, well over 10,000 people in all, work every daylight hour, and at night support personnel refuel their trucks and wash their laundry. Electric companies have a history of territoriality, and distribution line specialists, once known as linemen, habitually refer to those from other companies as ''foreign'' crews. But in many areas of Florida the foreigners now outnumber the natives. Otherwise, the workload would be overwhelming. But the damage they are discovering is overwhelming too. ''It's not about repairing, about slapping wire together and splicing it,'' said Geisha J. Williams, vice president of distribution at the Florida Power & Light Company, said in an interview at company headquarters in Miami. ''It's rebuild.'' ''In Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte and the Arcadia area, the damage is Andrewesque,'' Ms. Williams said. Her system's 23,000-volt feeder lines each serve about 400 customers. One single feeder line lost 600 poles, she said. Normally a crew can replace two to three poles a day. Brad Kimbro, a vice president of the Peace River Electric Cooperative, said, ''What took 60 years to build was basically torn down in one afternoon.'' His area lost at least 1,000 utility poles. ''It would take us years,'' he said. So, officials say, it will be at least another three weeks before all customers have power -- or at least those who have homes and businesses left Restoration is proceeding with unusual speed. Meter readers are sent out as scouts, to accompany utility crews down streets where all the street signs have blown away. The state has helped by sending the police to run utility trucks in convoys, to get through the thickening traffic, normally bad on the gulf coast but much worse now, because there are no traffic lights in many areas. But there are also glitches and difficulties. There is such a scarcity of hotel rooms that some crews must drive an hour and a half to their work sites, and thus lose three hours daily of their 14.5-hour workdays. At about $36 per hour of overtime, the commute costs Florida Power and Light, the state's largest electric utility, and eventually the consumers, about $100 a day, and worse, adds days to the length of the cleanup. And that is when things go well. On two nights recently, after long days of heavy physical labor in hot, humid weather, the crews have had to spend nights sleeping in their trucks. Mr. Kimbro said his headquarters people were sleeping on air mattresses in their offices; some have homes that are partly destroyed. And then there are other logistics for the visiting armies. ''I am serving 25,000 meals a day, delivering 25,000 gallons of drinking water a day, and 75,000 gallons of fuel a day,'' Ms. Williams said. The fuel moves in the kind of tanker trucks that supply gas stations. The work goes faster on the Atlantic coast of Florida because there are more hotels there, Ms. Williams said. Florida Power and Light, battered by storm after storm, has always had problems. Other utilities trim trees near their wires. This one cannot always do that. ''How do you trim a palm tree?'' Ms. Williams said. After Hurricane Andrew, the company developed a computer simulation. Enter the storm intensity and track and it predicts what supplies will be needed. ''You don't want to order 2,000 poles if you need 3,000,'' she said. (''We learned after Andrew'' is a mantra here, among local officials, emergency officials and utility executives.) The work is grueling but the line technicians generally like it. ''This is what they live for, this is their big league,'' Ms. Williams said. ''They want to go into towns and restore service. They get to be heroes.'' Still, three weeks without power in humid Florida is a hazard with every day that goes by, as officials acknowledge. ''It really comes down to getting electricity, as soon as possible,'' Tommy Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said in Fort Myers on Tuesday. So utilities are going an extraordinary distance, literally. Crews from Georgia and the Carolinas stayed home, fearing that Charley would hit there, but others came from the Midwest. On Briarcliff Road here today, a neighborhood of large single-family houses, Steve Campbell, of Bloomfield, Ind., who works for Cinergy/PSI in Indiana, took a break from looking for the flaw in a cable and said, ''This is the furthest that I've ever been, in 30 years.'' Mr. Campbell was impressed by the heat. But for another Indiana man, now working on the same street, Dave McCallem , a foreman at Asplundh, a tree-trimming company, it was the snakes that he was worried about. He said he spent his first night here sleeping on top of his truck, to keep away from them. ''And I've never been chased by alligators before,'' he said. The Cinergy group, 125 in all, at least had trucks with air-conditioning. The Asplundh trucks did not. The workers predicted they would not be going home for another two to three weeks. F.P.&L. said today that it expected to have all customers back by Aug. 29, but some of Florida's other companies and electric co-ops may take longer. Both crews were dispatched from the parking lot of a defunct shopping mall in Fort Myers. F.P.&L. had brought in a mobile command post with three satellite dishes. Nearby, a dining room was set up in a giant tent. HURRICANE CHARLEY: ELECTRICITY"
"Sgt. Darren Cockerham, the son of a geologist, can pinpoint one tiny difference between Florida and Iraq: On Florida's beaches, the grains of sand are square. In the baked Iraqi desert, they are round. Beyond that, the contrasts are almost too vast to articulate. But after seven months in Iraq escorting Iraqi exiles returning to help the war effort, and six days at home helping in the recovery from Hurricane Charley, Sergeant Cockerham, a full-time recruiter for the National Guard, offers a distinct perspective: The suffering in Florida now may be intense, he says, but it is temporary. In Iraq, where fundamental conflicts are thousands of years old, many of the people Sergeant Cockerham encountered may never see a happy ending. ''Punta Gorda is completely destroyed,'' he said of one of the Florida towns worst hit by the storm, ''but the country is trying to help. They're going to recover. They're going to get a house back. Their things will be replaced. ''That dude --'' here he referred to Saddam Hussein -- ''would just come down and bomb the village and leave them. No public works, no sanitation.'' ''In Iraq,'' he continued, ''I saw people that have absolutely nothing -- nothing to work for, nothing to look forward to. It really makes you appreciate being an American -- .'' He broke off, groaning. ''That sounded like a poster for the recruiting center. What have they done to my mind?'' In Iraq, there was never a moment's ease as Sergeant Cockerham, 26, traveled a route in Baghdad known as Sniper Alley, or stepped away from his Humvee moments before it burst into flames from a grenade attack, or bedded down in the open desert with his boots on. In his days of duty since Hurricane Charley, he has slept in an air-conditioned arena and stood on this evacuated resort island, watching newly hatched sea turtles stumble toward a starlit ocean. The two missions do require some of the same skills -- the ability, for example, to transform a military-issue entree into sweet and sour chicken by means of hot sauce and powdered cherry drink mix. And Sergeant Cockerham has seen some post-Charley excitement: one night, patrolling Fort Myers after curfew, the soldiers he was leading used night vision goggles to watch drug sales at a crack house, then alerted police officers, who arrested the buyers a few blocks away. But the stress is not comparable. ''Mentally and physically, it's a lot easier,'' he said. ''In Iraq there was the constant fear, the wondering if I was ever going to walk on grass again. I know I'm going to go home after this is over. I had no idea if I'd be getting out of Iraq.'' Sergeant Cockerham is, in the words of his battalion commander, Maj. Marty Nichols, a ''soldier's soldier,'' one who relishes push-ups and laments the loss of Bob Hope. But he has not volunteered to go if, as appears likely, about half his unit, the Second Battalion of the 116th Field Artillery, is deployed to Afghanistan next year. Being in Iraq, he said, altered his priorities in the direction of friends and family. And less than a month ago, he became a father. ''On the one hand, I don't want to have anything to do with leaving again,'' he said. ''I'm not going to volunteer. You don't want to come back and find your baby girl walking and talking, and you weren't there for it. On the other hand, it's my duty. I'm a soldier. If they tell me to go, I'll go.'' The effects of his combat experience have not left him. He refuses to put the removable doors on his Humvee, because they would prevent a quick exit. He can hear suspect noises over the roar of the engine. His words carry a special authority when, on the fourth day of hurricane duty, he grabs a tired young private and says: ''Relax. I want to go home, too. You always want to go home.'' Like many soldiers, Sergeant Cockerham shies from political discussion. It is not his job, he says, to have an opinion about the invasion of Iraq. He does have strong views, however, on the subject of Guard troops and Army Reservists who say they never anticipated being sent overseas for extended periods. ''It's a big thing with me,'' he said. ''You joined the military. That's what the military does: defend the country and the Constitution.'' The National Guard answers to two masters: the state and the federal government. Of Florida's 12,000 Guard troops, 4,600 are helping with the hurricane recovery effort, 1,000 are deployed overseas, and 1,000 others are performing tasks like reinforcing security at military bases. Sergeant Cockerham, who once envisioned joining the Coast Guard but served in the Army because the waiting list was too long, is a son of the Gulf Coast. He grew up near the mouth of the Manatee River and lives in Ruskin, near Tampa. He used to farm aquarium fish. His parents are junior high school teachers. Patrolling Captiva Island, he points out the luminescent tide, notes the rancid perfume of the mangroves and locates a family of manatees grazing in the shallows. When he returned from Iraq, he took his family's fishing boat into the gulf for six days. There he drank rum cocktails, listened to Jimmy Buffett and, he says, talked to the moon. There are certain aspects of his Iraq tour -- particularly the details of violence -- that he will not discuss with other people. When pressed, he estimates that he fired his weapon on 20 to 30 occasions. ''It's not something I really kept track of,'' he said. ''I just fire the weapon, clean the weapon, reload the weapon.'' But he likes to tell the story of the little Iraqi girl he took to a military hospital for a lifesaving operation. While there, he was pressed into service as a night-shift intensive care nurse. And he will talk about the Iraqi exiles who were his charges, many of whom he saw reunited with their families for the first time in decades. But standing on the shore of Captiva Island, with the Milky Way snaking vividly across the sky, he would not acknowledge that Iraq had any comparable natural beauty. ''There was one thing I enjoyed,'' he said. ''There was one night at the palace in Babylon when the sun set in the palm trees.'' He picked up a piece of sand from Captiva Beach and sniffed it. ''It smells like home,'' he said. HURRICANE CHARLEY: A SOLDIER'S STORY"
"Mark Silverman has a .357 revolver and a couple of dogs he can use to deal with anyone foolish enough to wander down his street, Scenic View Drive, after dark. ''I'm not kidding about this,'' Mr. Silverman said, gesturing at his family's property. ''Looting will not be tolerated. This is all we've got.'' A few miles away at the Windmill Village trailer park, one of the places hardest hit by Hurricane Charley, some of the elderly residents who remain have organized a round-the-clock security squad, and rumors were rife Friday about robbers on the prowl. But in actuality, relief officials said, there has been only one verified incident of looting in the community, by a 73-year-old resident who quietly helped herself to some of her absent neighbors' possessions. ''There are a lot of rumors, but not much real looting,'' said Michael Jennings, who was organizing the relief efforts at Windmill Village. ''Paranoia, frankly, is a bigger concern. The stress and tension is mounting as the days pass.'' Earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural disasters are often followed by spates of looting, as if nature's disruption is echoed by a fracture in societal order. In the wake of this hurricane, however, there has been relative calm. Here in Charlotte County, which took the brunt of the storm, there had been only 33 hurricane-related arrests as of Thursday evening, said Ignatius Carroll, a spokesman for the emergency response effort. And that total, Mr. Carroll emphasized, is for a wide variety of offenses: not only looting -- incidents of which have been few, he said -- but also price-gouging, curfew violations and prowling. In neighboring DeSoto County, six people were arrested on Monday in Arcadia for violating the local curfew in an incident law enforcement officials say may have been looting-related, and officials elsewhere reported a similar smattering of small-scale offenses. A crime wave this is not, though that has not stopped the rumors. ''I heard that a computer was stolen,'' said Maggie Nash, who is among a population of what are normally hundreds of Windmill Village residents, most of them elderly. ''And one lady had her medicine taken. I also heard about people sneaking in by boat and looting, but that may just be a rumor. Something like that happened six years ago, and I wonder if the story is just getting recycled.'' Actually the local police did say there had been a report of a man floating into the community along adjacent Alligator Creek and breaking into one of the homes; they vowed to increase vigilance against looting-by-water. But a sheriff's spokesman said the authorities could not confirm that the incident had really occurred. What was left of Windmill Village baked in the sun Friday, a debris-strewn stretch of mud and twisted aluminum looking less like a wrecked community than like a city dump someone was trying to organize. Several dozen aged residents, sweating and grim, rested on plastic chairs beneath the twin peaks of a shade tent donated by the local Home Depot. Since the storm hit, those residents who have continued to live in the community had been eating together in the roofless, tottering remains of the park's recreation center. But on Thursday, relief officials declared the building unsafe and forced them outside. Almost as soon as the hurricane had passed through, some two dozen of the trailer park's residents, some carrying shotguns or other weapons, organized themselves into a makeshift security squad, patrolling the dark streets, monitoring the perimeter and taking note of every person who tried to enter the community. ''So far I've been staying elsewhere, because I don't have a generator,'' said George Crossett, one of the Windmill Village residents who gathered Thursday afternoon to hear a report from relief officials. ''But I think I may move back here and join up with those guys. I don't like what I'm hearing here.'' What Mr. Crossett and others at Thursday's meeting did not like was that they were being urged by relief officials to move out of their homes, at least for the time being, and take their possessions with them. The homes now lack water and power, and in some cases also pose a danger of collapse. ''But if we all move out of here,'' Mr. Crossett said, ''what's going to stop looters then?'' Mr. Jennings, the relief organizer, tried to assure the residents that National Guard troops stationed at the community's perimeter would keep looters at bay, although he acknowledged that the troops would not be there around the clock, as there were only 500 to patrol the entire county. ''Come on, people,'' Mr. Jennings told the residents in a weary yet sympathetic voice. ''You know, in your hearts, that you cannot stay here.'' But Ms. Nash, for her part, said she intended to stay at Windmill Village until someone forced her out. ''My home is one of the newer ones, and it's still in good shape,'' she said. ''My husband and I can come down here to the portable toilets every night before we go to bed. We're fine, and we're staying.'' Mr. Jennings, who teaches at nearby North Port High School and leads the local Community Emergency Response Team, said a major problem had been getting the elderly residents to accept that they could not remain. ''I kind of adopted this area to focus on because my grandfather lives just around the corner,'' he said. ''But it's heartbreaking. A lot of these people are old and scared, and they are afraid what will happen if they leave their homes.'' ''We're going to bring in some teams on Saturday to help people box up their possessions,'' Mr. Jennings said, ''and we're bringing in some mental health people, too.'' Part of what is driving the rumors of looting, he said, is that they provide a further argument for those unwilling to leave. Residents, on the other hand, say they fear that police assurances of minimal looting are disingenuous, intended only to avert panic and restrain itchy trigger fingers. The elderly people of Windmill Village are not the only ones worried about looting. Law enforcement officials in Charlotte County and elsewhere said many residents had posted signs warning away thieves. ''Looters Will Be Killed,'' said a sign at the Port Charlotte home of Terry Frye, who punctuated the announcement by positioning himself outside with a shotgun. ''Neighborhood Watch Protected by .357,'' read the sign Mr. Silverman placed at the entrance to Scenic View Drive. He is not so sure that the threat of looting is as limited as law enforcement officials claim. Mr. Silverman, a real-estate property manager in his 40's, said Guard troops had been working hard to limit entry to the storm-damaged area at night, with checkpoints on major access roads. ''But I've already scared some people off a couple of times since the storm,'' he said. ''There were three or four of them on foot the other night. They sure looked like looters. I don't know what else they'd be doing here in the middle of the night. I heard the neighbor's dogs barking, and then I let my dogs out.'' The dim figures disappeared into the gloom, he said. ''You've got to be careful walking around at night where you don't belong,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''You might just get shot.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: SECURITY"
"Tiffany Logan had been in charge of the makeshift relief center in the Church of God gymnasium almost since the last gust of Hurricane Charley blew through town, but she was not there on Tuesday. She had to go back to school. Ms. Logan is 16. ''No question, there's a lot of work to be done,'' said Jed Jewell, who owns the downtown Pioneer Restaurant with his wife, Anna Bell. ''And we're all pretty tired. But things are showing signs of getting back to normal here in Zolfo Springs.'' When the storm hit shore 11 days ago at Charlotte Harbor, pulverizing the Punta Gorda town clock at 4:17 p.m., it swirled through the subdivisions and retail strips of the central Gulf Coast, then streaked northeast along the line of U.S. Highway 17. The inland counties of De Soto and Hardee and Polk have not received as much attention as the fancier coastal areas. But a stop at any of the tiny agricultural towns along Highway 17 -- Arcadia, Wauchula, Bowling Green, Fort Meade -- shows the same mix of misery and pluck found here in Zolfo Springs, and the same sense of a weary community stirring back to life. After a week of picking through debris, chopping trees, putting tarps on roofs and fighting for sleep through sweltering nights alive with the whine of mosquitoes, the people of Hardee County are happily embracing the glories of air-conditioning. ''We got the power back on about midday on Sunday and I had my first hot shower and good, air-conditioned night's sleep in more than a week,'' said Jack Logan, Zolfo Springs' city clerk and Tiffany's father. One of the recent heroes, Bubba Bass, who operates the sewage treatment plant and almost single-handedly got the water back on two days after the storm, was shaking his head disgustedly as he walked through City Hall on Tuesday. ''We lost our potable,'' he said sadly. What he meant was that the water system, which he had labored night and day to have declared drinkable last Thursday, had been breached, and residents were again forced to boil what comes from their taps before drinking it. ''We'll get it done again,'' Mr. Bass said. The town's police and fire station, next to City Hall, were wrecked by the storm, which also destroyed or seriously damaged about 75 percent of Zolfo Springs' homes. More than a dozen sweaty inmates from the nearby Hardee Correctional Facility who had been volunteering in town waited in the muggy shade of the ruined police station on Tuesday afternoon for a van to carry them back to prison. The Pioneer Restaurant, which the Jewells reopened four days after the storm -- until Monday it was the only operating business in the city -- was no longer the only game in town. The Cracker Plantation and Roosters, two other dining spots, had reopened with the arrival of electricity, as had the Cut 'n' Curls beauty salon and the Mobil gas station. But the 3 Hermanos Boutique remained closed, as did the biggest downtown store, the Zolfo Supermarket, its roof peeled back like the lid of a sardine can. As recently as Saturday, with the lights still out and the wreckage still fresh, it was a very different scene in Zolfo Springs. Tiffany Logan, in a green shirt and khaki shorts, was keeping a keen eye on activity inside the Christian Heritage Church of God's gymnasium, where she clutched a notepad and maintained order with a crew of six local volunteers and 16 prison inmates. While pointing with one arm toward an open patch of floor where inmates could stack some crates of infant formula, Ms. Logan kept an eye on the unloading of yet another pick-up full of donated goods. ''You don't want to mess with her,'' cautioned the Rev. Bob Blazier, who had offered the use of the building as the main relief center. ''Take my word for it.'' At the Pioneer on Saturday, the breakfast special was two eggs, sausage patties (or fried bologna) and grits or potatoes for $3.50. ''I was standing right about here when Charley hit,'' Mr. Jewell said, one hand on the cash register. ''First, that whole wall of windows blew out. There was glass everywhere. And then this window over here went, too. But you see this bulletin board?'' He pointed to a corkboard on the wall near the entrance, a half-dozen perfect rows of business cards held in place with stick pins. ''That's exactly the way it was before the storm hit,'' he said. ''Not one out of place. That's weird, isn't it?'' Despite the damage, Zolfo was one of the lucky towns; not one resident died or was seriously hurt in the storm. The main drag runs south from the Pioneer along Highway 17. There's not much left to see. Half-downed trees still totter at odd angles along both sides of every side street, the leaves now brown and brittle. Zolfo Springs was to celebrate its centennial in October, Mr. Logan said, but the party has been postponed. According to local legend, Italian railroad workers named the settlement in the late 1800's. ''Whenever they dug a hole, sulfurous water would bubble up into it,'' Mr. Logan said. ''And zolfo is Italian for sulfur.'' In 1920, when newly formed Hardee County was carved out of adjacent De Soto, town fathers decided the name Zolfo lacked a certain tone, so they added Springs. That was pretty much the city's high water mark, when the railroad still stopped here. But in 1920, it was Wauchula, the next town up Highway 17, that was chosen as county seat, and now that is where the bigger shops and the fast-food chains are. Zolfo Springs is a working town of 1,641 people -- -- 53 percent of them Hispanic, 43 percent white and 4 percent black. Most locals labor in the citrus groves and cattle ranches, or work in nearby phosphate mines. It is no vacation magnet, Mr. Logan said, though there were a few trailer parks catering to snowbirds wanting to winter in Florida but unable to afford the coastal prices. ''They're all gone now, Charley wiped them out,'' he said. Places like Oak Hill and Little Charlie's Campground are fields of shiny rubble. ''I've talked to a few of the snowbirds,'' Mr. Logan said. ''And they're not coming back.'' Ricky Selph, one of the town's part-time deputies, said he took his patrol car and a loudspeaker to the trailer parks in the hours before the hurricane hit, ordering people to evacuate. The police in some areas had trouble getting residents to comply, but not him. ''I didn't give them any choice,'' Mr. Selph said. ''I told them it was the law and they had to get.'' There have been a few cases of looting since the storm, mostly outsiders picking through the trailer park debris, but mostly it has been quiet, the deputy said. Mr. Blazier, the pastor, said he and a few families from his congregation had ridden out the storm in the sanctuary. ''I think a lot of people got caught here because they thought the hurricane was going to be another false alarm, like we've had before.'' By Tuesday, the church's gymnasium was nearly cleaned out -- the last truckload of relief goods transported across town to a new facility in Pioneer Park,. In the gym, the last of the convicts were shooting baskets under the watchful eye of a corrections officer. The story was the same up and down Highway 17 on Tuesday -- a lot of clean-up and repair work remained, but central Florida was stirring back to life. State officials reported Tuesday that nearly all homes that were capable of receiving electricity had had their power restored, except for some in the hardest-hit areas in Arcadia and along the Gulf Coast. Most schools were back in session and the rest were set to open by Monday. Chris Selph, 15, who had been Tiffany's assistant in running the relief center, sat on a folding chair on Tuesday afternoon as a giant industrial fan ruffled his hair. One more truckload of goods to Pioneer Park and they would be finished. ''My school isn't going back until next week,'' he said, not sounding too unhappy about it. ''It's getting to be almost normal around here.''"
"On the first business day since Hurricane Charley slammed into Charlotte County, the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Monday was looking past disaster relief to recovery. The agency opened its first disaster relief center, where homeowners and business owners could come to apply for help like low-interest loans and unemployment insurance benefits. The polite, sympathetic and generally well-informed aid counselors set up in the steaming gymnasium of a community recreation center, which remained without electricity and other basic services. The only light came through the windows, and staff members offered flashlights to visitors who needed to use the toilets. Jay and Sunita Misir walked in with their two children and were promptly seated at a metal folding table with Jenny Stewart, who works in a division of the Small Business Administration that handles relief. The Misirs' coin-operated laundry in Punta Gorda was wrecked, along with a rental property nearby. The roof on their home was damaged and carrying a heavy load of standing water. Both cars were scratched. ''Have you talked to your insurance company?'' Ms. Stewart asked. When Mr. Misir asked if he could use a phone to contact his two insurers, Ms. Stewart pointed across the basketball court. ''We have a row of them over there,'' she said. ''But we have no phone lines.'' People who have lost power, water and roofs -- as well as emergency experts across the country -- will be closely gauging the agency's performance in the days ahead. In part, they are comparing the response to that after Hurricane Andrew, 12 years ago. But Hurricane Charley is also the Federal Emergency Management Agency's biggest challenge since the agency was made part of the Department of Homeland Security on the theory that the imminent threat to the nation was terrorism, and not what insurance agents here call an act of God. James Lee Witt, who was the agency's director under President Bill Clinton, testified in March before a House Government Reform subcommittee that ''FEMA, having lost its status as an independent agency, is being buried beneath a massive bureaucracy whose main and only focus is fighting terrorism.'' It should be ''extracted,'' Mr. Witt said. The Bush administration's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 includes sharp reductions in financing for urban search and rescue teams, several of which have been used in Florida in the last few days to look for bodies in the wreckage, and cuts in grants to state emergency management programs. For most people here, the agency is indistinguishable from others responding to the hurricane. And the immediate problems for many people remain in basic services: electricity, telephones and water, and debris removal from the street. FEMA was established in 1979, and in its early years it was largely limited to writing checks to disaster victims. Under Mr. Witt, it acquired more operational capabilities. By the time of Hurricane Charley's approach, it had begun moving emergency supplies from pre-established depots toward the threatened area. Some observers fear that the agency has lost some clout; under President Clinton, for example, the director was a cabinet member; now he reports to a member of the cabinet. Mr. Witt said in a telephone interview on Monday that it would be inappropriate to critique the agency in the midst of a disaster response, and that he continued to be impressed with the capabilities and dedication of its employees. Michael D. Brown, the current director, has said he has access to the president and the heads of other federal agencies. But at a conference in Orlando in April on hurricane preparedness, at which Mr. Witt was a speaker, Mr. Brown introduced him with an impromptu line about listening very carefully to what Mr. Witt had to say, and Mr. Witt voiced his misgivings about domestic security. Some attendees interpreted their comments combined as Mr. Brown's endorsement of his predecessor's concerns. The latest disaster commands a high profile, and thus is likely to command the full attention of the Bush administration, some disaster experts say. ''And it's in the middle of an election,'' Mr. Witt observed. For the Misir family, help was across the basketball court. Under one hoop, Julie Sills, wearing a bright green T-shirt that said, ''Florida Department of Financial Services,'' took down all of the family's information on a battery-powered laptop computer. Later, the state will bring in a satellite dish, Ms. Sills said, and upload the information directly to the insurance companies. In the parking lot, people could apply for unemployment insurance payments at a mobile office. In this smashed city, it was a start, but a sweltering one. Ms. Stewart, the Small Business Administration official, had arrived in Florida at 1 a.m. Monday, coming direct from Ohio, where she had been helping handle applications for aid after flooding there in May. She said she would be happy to see the Misirs again, if they returned. But she said, fanning herself with an emergency brochure, ''I don't know why you'd want to.'' Ms. Misir carried a dish towel that she used alternately to fan her face and mop it. Finding the center is a challenge for some, since most street signs are gone. FEMA brought in the type of flashing highway signs that might advise, ''Left Lane Closed Ahead.'' Instead, one said, ''FEMA at Harold Ctr.'' Lea Anne McBride, a spokeswoman from the agency's Washington headquarters, said this disaster center was being opened a mere 48 hours after the declaration of an emergency. Jay M. Eaker, a spokesman for the agency, said that many more disaster relief centers would open soon, each with 50 or 60 representatives of government agencies to offer one-stop-shopping assistance. ''Give us a couple of days, and it will be smooth as silk,'' Mr. Eaker said.

"Most of the victims of Hurricane Charley at least know how bad things are. But not Darwin Ford and Jennifer de Lignieres. Like the 7,000 other year-round residents of the barrier islands of Sanibel and Captiva, they have not been allowed to go back. They have not seen the little pink and white motel that they sunk all their savings into one year ago, or their house. ''It's horrible,'' said Mr. Ford, 44, at the Hilton Garden Inn where he and Ms. de Lignieres had taken refuge after a night in their boat in a church parking lot. ''If we could see the damage, we could at least be thinking about what we have to do.'' As yet, the islands have no functioning sewer system, electricity or water. And North Captiva Island, a luxurious community accessible only by boat or private plane, was split in two by the hurricane. Still, desperate residents -- blocked from using the lone causeway to the islands by National Guard troops -- have tried to sneak past patrol boats and reach their homes by sea. Others have pleaded and pulled strings. Lee County sheriff's deputies used a stun gun on Monday to subdue a man trying to get to his home on Fort Myers Beach, another closed-off area. Sheriff's officials said deputies used force after the man refused orders to stop and then put his car in drive. He was arrested. After a television report on upset residents unable to reach their homes, the Sanibel City Council, meeting in Fort Myers, announced Monday night that it would reopen the island on Wednesday. But that is not soon enough for some. Shauna Gulnac, 47, who owns a grocery store and a liquor store on Captiva, was stuck Monday at a National Guard checkpoint between the islands of Sanibel and Captiva, trying to cajole her way across. ''This is my second time today and I tried twice yesterday,'' said Ms. Gulnac, 47. She was standing next to her car at the Captiva checkpoint while National Guardsmen tried, at her insistence, to contact the fire chief to see if he would let her cross. ''We've had this business 19 years,'' she said. ''We know everyone on that island.'' Ms. Gulnac said she wanted to salvage what food she could from her freezers. ''For me not to get back to the store, every day is just so much money I'm losing,'' she said. A causeway runs from the mainland to Sanibel and then to Captiva. Ms. Gulnac stayed on Sanibel during the storm but now could not get from there to Captiva. Until Monday, when emergency workers finished clearing it, the main road was a thicket of fallen trees and tangled power lines. The authorities have urged people in disaster areas on the mainland to stay off the roads as well, but on an evacuated island, that directive is more easily enforced. National Guard soldiers have escorted reporters one by one to glimpse the damage. Although the islands were hard hit, buildings and homes did not bear as much structural damage as the port cities -- especially on Captiva, the more exclusive of the two islands, which thrive mainly on tourism and have acreage set aside as nature preserves. At the far tip of Captiva on Monday, the 330-acre South Seas Resort served free food to hungry workers from the National Guard and the federal and state fish and wildlife agencies. The general manager of the resort, Chris van der Baars, said he got back on the island by boat. ''We were chased by the police, but my friend has a very fast boat,'' he said. He has since persuaded the authorities to allow some of his staff to come onto the island during the day, where they have started repairing the damage. But, he said, there is good reason to keep everyone else off. ''There's no point in getting people back here if you've got no power, no water and no sewage,'' he said. ''It just overburdens the systems.'' Such arrangements have led many residents to believe that the emergency policy is not being uniformly applied. ''They're picking and choosing who goes up there,'' Ms. Gulnac said, adding that one friend of hers, a restaurateur, waved as he passed by, escorted by uniformed men. Most people do not know the fates of their homes. ''The only thing we know, it's by rumors,'' said Tom Taylor, a retiree who with his wife, Harriet, lives in a mobile home park on Sanibel. They are now staying in a Fort Myers hotel. ''I called some friends of ours that have a place in the park,'' Mr. Taylor said ''They're in Travis, Mich., and they had heard from someone in Colorado who had talked to this fellow who had stayed on the island. And he said other than limbs being down, there wasn't much damage to the trailer homes.'' He shrugged helplessly. The Taylors have been coming to Sanibel for 15 years, but it was only about a week ago that they moved here for good from St. Louis, bringing all their furniture. Still, they were philosophical about their plight. ''I'm retired,'' Ms. Taylor explained. ''Now that we have our children raised and everything, we just go with the flow.'' HURRICANE CHARLEY: REFUGEES"
"Hurricane Charley ripped through some of the nation's richest agricultural land, inflicting hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to Florida's second-largest industry after tourism, state officials said on Monday. The hurricane uprooted orange and grapefruit trees, shattered greenhouses and smashed barns, tractors and fences on vegetable farms and cattle ranches. ''We think the damage is going to be in the hundreds of millions,'' Charles H. Bronson, the Florida commissioner of agriculture, said in an interview here. ''It could be a billion or more -- we just don't know yet.'' Speaking on the tarmac of Kissimmee Gateway Airport as he prepared to board a helicopter to look at the farm damage to the south and west, Mr. Bronson said earlier reports suggested that the heaviest damage had been to citrus and the fast-growing nursery business that uses greenhouses to produce potted shrubs, flowers and trees and seedlings for customers throughout the United States. ''There is some serious damage, especially to citrus,'' Mr. Bronson said, adding that ''a lot of greenhouses have been knocked down and totally destroyed, in some cases.'' Dan Richey, the chief executive of River Fruit Packing in Vero Beach, on the Atlantic coast of Florida, said the hurricane had torn up a 25- to 50-mile swath of the state's citrus belt from Arcadia in the south to Orlando. ''It moved right through the heart of our citrus-growing area,'' said Mr. Richey, who served until June as chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission. None of the cattle in Florida's huge beef and dairy herds have been found dead as a result of the storm, officials said. But Mr. Bronson said that because of the widespread loss of electricity, thousands of dairy cattle on 10 farms had not been milked for days and were in danger of ''drying up'' as milk producers. The state is bringing in electric generators to operate the farms' milking machines, he said. Mr. Bronson said his department was also working to help the state's migrant farm workers, many of whom lost homes in the hurricane and, with the crop damage, may lose their jobs. Representative Adam H. Putnam, a Republican whose family owns citrus farms and cattle ranches here, said the hurricane's gusts shook oranges and grapefruit off many trees. ''There's a lot of fruit on the ground,'' said Mr. Putnam, who was traveling with the agriculture commissioner. While oranges have been an enduring symbol of Florida, Mr. Bronson said that three years ago ornamental plants edged past oranges, limes and grapefruit to become the state's biggest agricultural money maker. An aide said that citrus now brought in about $1.5 billion in revenue compared with $1.6 billion for nursery plants. The total impact on the Florida economy from the nurseries, Mr. Bronson said, is estimated at $10.7 billion, compared with $9.4 billion from citrus. Agriculture contributed $50 billion to Florida's $472 billion economy in 2003, only $2 billion less than tourism, said Pam Dana, director of the Florida Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development in Tallahassee. Florida is the nation's leading producer of oranges, grapefruit and sugar cane and ranks second in nursery plants and tomatoes. Prices for citrus fruit and juices were depressed last year because of oversupply. One possible effect of the storm damage may be to reduce the world's supply of citrus and thus raise prices for the industry. Forty-four years ago, Hurricane Donna caused flooding in the central farm region that killed many cattle, Mr. Bronson said. But he said much higher economic losses were caused in 1992 by Hurricane Andrew, which ravaged South Florida and destroyed lime, avocado and mango groves. The damage from Hurricane Charley ranges over a large part of the state, he said, while Hurricane Andrew's force was much more tightly contained. As a result, Mr. Bronson said, this hurricane's impact on agriculture could be greater than Hurricane Andrew's. The 1992 storm, with total damages of $20 billion, was the most economically devastating hurricane in modern times. The airfield here where Mr. Bronson stopped to talk with Osceola County officials bore the scars of Hurricane Charley, too. Across the runway from Mr. Bronson's helicopter, a huge dome-shaped steel hangar lay in a crumpled ruin, 15 small aircraft pinned under it. In another direction, a smaller steel hangar had collapsed on five planes. Two other planes with damaged fuselages straddled ditches. Five other planes were wrecked when empty steel hangars were flung through the air by the hurricane's winds. HURRICANE CHARLEY: AGRICULTURE"
"President Bush blended cash, campaigning and anti-Castro politics in Miami on Friday, announcing he would ask Congress for $2 billion in hurricane relief, appearing with the Democrat who will give the keynote speech at next week's Republican convention, and accusing Senator John Kerry of flip-flopping on how to bring down the Cuban government. Mr. Bush's appearance here, as he tried to fuel a small but noticeable improvement in the polls, marked his third trip to Florida in as many weeks. And there is no let-up in sight to his preconvention race through swing states. He will spend Saturday in Ohio, Sunday in West Virginia and then run through New Hampshire, Michigan, Tennessee, Iowa, Pennsylvania and back to Ohio before ending up in New York on Wednesday night. ''Somewhere in the next few days we'll revise his convention speech,'' one of his most senior aides said as Mr. Bush began this string of appearances in New Mexico on Thursday. ''But don't ask me when.'' Mr. Bush began his visit here at Fire Station No. 2 for the briefest of briefings by the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Mike Brown, about efforts to recover from Hurricane Charley and Tropical Storm Bonnie. There were no firefighters in sight, but Mr. Bush brought along a politically powerful weapon: Representative C.W. Bill Young of Florida, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who nodded approval as Mr. Bush called ''for $2 billion to help continue to rebuild Florida.'' Mr. Young ''knows the west coast of Florida really well,'' said Mr. Bush, referring to the areas hard hit by the storms, adding, ''And as importantly, he knows how the Congress works well.'' Jeb Bush, the Florida governor and the president's brother, joined him at the aid announcement, but was not on the stage at the campaign event that followed. Still, politics suffuses the relief effort. Florida holds 27 electoral votes, and Mr. Bush and his brother have expressed their determination not to repeat the 2000 recount, which ended with Mr. Bush winning the state by 537 votes. ''We'll be in Florida a lot between now and Election Day,'' Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, told the crowd on Friday. The firehouse announcement was just the beginning of Mr. Bush's effort on Friday, which moved immediately to a rally at the Miami Arena, where an enthusiastic crowd, outfitted with red shirts and matching signs, called out ''Viva Bush.'' Mr. Bush broke into Spanish frequently, particularly when making points about the differences between his views and Senator Kerry's. He was introduced by Senator Zell Miller, the Georgia Democrat who will be the keynote speaker at next week's convention. Senator Miller, who spoke at the 1992 convention nominating Bill Clinton, is particularly valued as a sitting Democrat willing to publicly excoriate Senator Kerry. ''There are many Democrats here and around the country who put the safety of our family above partisan politics,'' Senator Miller said to cheers. Mr. Bush amended his standard rally speech to call Fidel Castro a ''tyrant.'' Then he took a new tack against Mr. Kerry, especially tailored for the Cuban-American community in Miami. He accused Mr. Kerry of taking both sides of the Cuban embargo, a strategy that the United States has pursued against Mr. Castro for four decades. Mr. Bush has long favored the embargo. ''Last year, after Castro launched a brutal crackdown on dissidents, my opponent responded by voting to reward the dictator by lifting the tourism travel ban,'' Mr. Bush said. The crowd booed. ''He eventually criticized some of the dissidents,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Kerry, as the crowd booed again. Then he said, accurately, that Senator Kerry had voted twice for the main sanctions law, known as Helms-Burton for its author, but voted against a final version of the law. ''In other words, he voted for it because he voted against it,'' he said, a take-off on Mr. Bush's favorite line on Mr. Kerry's Iraq votes. The Kerry campaign responded by listing Mr. Kerry's vote for what they called ''strategic, smart sanctions'' to help achieve American goals on Cuba, and said Mr. Bush's new limits on sending money to Cubans were being opposed by many Cuban Americans, who cannot help their families on the island. THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE PRESIDENT"
"Since Hurricane Charley slammed Florida, Angel James has been adrift. A huge oak tree crashed onto the roof of Mr. James's house during the storm a week ago. Because he needed the money to make ends meet, he had let the insurance lapse. Then he discovered that the hurricane also took his job, destroying the orange groves where he usually works. ''I don't know what we are going to do,'' he said Thursday in front of a row of shattered buildings in Wauchula, one of the hardest hit towns, about 70 miles north of here. For Mr. James, who is temporarily living with a daughter, and many other victims of the hurricane, the outlook could not seem bleaker. But if history is any guide, his prospects and those for all of Florida will greatly improve in the coming weeks as billions of dollars in insurance money and federal aid pour into the state, as it did after the devastating blows of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. ''This is going to be a temporary jolt,'' said J. Antonio Villamil, the chairman of Gov. Jeb Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. ''We're going to experience a boom in new construction and repairs and road building. We're already seeing people being re-employed in reconstruction.'' Hurricane Charley shut down restaurants, department stores, neighborhood businesses and the makers of everything from small boats to military equipment. Officials estimate $150 million in damage to next year's citrus crop. And economists say some tourists canceled vacation plans. Mr. Villamil said that as a result of the hurricane, he expected Florida's economic growth to slow to an annualized rate of about 4.5 percent for the three months ending in September, down from 4.8 percent in the previous period. The jobless percentage will probably rise to 4.5 or 4.6 percent from 4.3 percent, Mr. Villamil said, and retail sales will decline. But state officials say the slowdown caused by Hurricane Charley, with estimated losses of $20 billion, will probably last no more than a month or two. Just as after Hurricane Andrew -- an even more costly storm, at nearly $35 billion in today's dollars -- Florida will almost certainly be swept up in a mini-boom as construction crews swarm over the 21 counties damaged by the storm, and restoration money ripples through the state. Florida is also likely to benefit from election-year politics. It is a pivotal state, and the governor is President Bush's brother. ''State and federal aid will be quickly forthcoming to ensure that the pain and suffering of ordinary people and business is limited,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, who was vacationing in Daytona Beach when the storm hit and has spent the last few days ripping up soaked carpets in his mother-in-law's condominium there. ''There will be a measurable boost to the economy,'' Mr. Zandi said. Mr. Villamil estimated that Florida ''could easily see growth of 5 percent'' in the latter part of the year, compared with national economic growth that has been running at just below 4 percent. ''We could see growth moving to 5.5 percent or 6 percent next year,'' he said. Hurricane Andrew gave Florida's economy an even bigger lift, economists say. After growing less than 1 percent in 1991 as a national recession began to fade, the state's economy grew 2.7 percent in 1992, spurred largely by an influx of disaster money, said David Wyss, the chief economist for Standard & Poor's. Florida's growth rate rose to 3.7 percent in 1993 and to 4.1 percent in 1994. A year after the storm, unemployment across Florida fell to 7 percent, from 8.3 percent. Part of that improvement, economists say, reflected a national recovery from the recession. But in Florida, jobs in the construction industry alone rose 9.2 percent. Robert Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, estimates that Florida residents and businesses will collect more than $7 billion from insurance companies. State officials and independent economists expect Washington to close the gap on the state's estimated $20 billion in damage. ''In most natural disasters, the insurance and government aid do not make the regional economy whole again,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''But given the importance of Florida politically and this being an election year, I'd be surprised if the residents are not made whole.'' Even so, the impact of the insurance and government money is expected to be milder than in 1992, partly because Florida's economy is stronger now and, at $500 billion a year, about a third larger. Florida is pinning much of its hope on tourism, its leading industry, just ahead of farming. Pam Dana, director of the Department of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development, said the television images of broken houses and mobile home parks could cause people to think twice before planning a vacation. But she said the storm had little effect on the state's biggest attractions, Walt Disney World and other theme parks and the beaches of South Florida. Still, the state has already taken the first steps in an advertising counteroffensive. ''We want to get the word out that Florida by and large is open,'' said Tom Flanigan, a spokesman for Visit Florida, the state tourism agency. The recovery after Hurricane Andrew got off to a slow start because of delays in federal assistance, said Mr. Villamil, who at the time was the under secretary of commerce for economic affairs for the first President Bush. ''We didn't have the strong coordination between the federal government and the state that we have now,'' he said. The money from Washington is already starting to flow and Governor Bush is urging the Legislature to vote next week on freeing up millions in relief funds. This week, Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of labor, visited battered areas and said she would immediately send $50 million to ease the strain of unemployment. Mr. Villamil noted the quick assessment of citrus losses by the Department of Agriculture and said most of it would probably be offset by federal farm aid. Since soon after the winds died down, representatives of the Small Business Administration have been taking applications for 15- to 30-year loans at 2 percent to 3.5 percent. With the prime lending rate at about 4.5 percent, Mr. Villamil said, most small-business owners seeking loans before the storm were paying 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent from commercial lenders. Even Mr. James, the migrant worker, who is 56 and the father of nine, said he was planning to apply for an S.B.A. loan. He is doubtful that he can qualify, he said, but he needs money to fix his home, which he bought for $30,000 years ago. And with a loan, he says, perhaps he can realize his long-held dream of starting a greenhouse nursery and ending his dependence on the weather and the changing needs of farm owners. ''I'm pretty sure I've got good credit,'' Mr. James said. ''But I don't know how it will work out. It's a hard life, and it's gotten even harder.''"
"BILL Ryall, a Manhattan architect, is about to build an addition to a client's house on Shelter Island, at the east end of Long Island. In the living room, a series of sliding glass panels, each eight feet wide, will disappear into a wall. ''The effect,'' he said, ''will be dramatic.'' But the windows Mr. Ryall wants to use have not been proven to resist flying debris, a requirement of residential building codes in effect on eastern Long Island since 2003. To comply, a sample window would have to withstand a ''missile test,'' deflecting a two-by-four fired at the speed of 50 feet a second. After Hurricane Andrew caused billions of dollars in property damage in 1992, Dade County, Fla., began requiring wind-resistant windows in new houses. The requirement was incorporated into residential building codes adopted, with some amendments, by Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island. In those states, hurricane-resistant windows are required in houses built in many coastal areas. The windows are made from layers of glass laminated onto sheets of plastic. ''The idea is to keep the building envelope secure,'' said Anthony Head, the regulatory product planner for Marvin Windows and Doors, a manufacturer in Warroad, Minn. Not surprisingly, insurance companies favor the rules, because broken windows can lead to extensive damage inside. In addition, a broken window makes an entire structure vulnerable, said Robert Wieboldt, the executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute. Hurricane-proof windows are 50 to 70 percent more expensive than other windows, and that is on top of the expense of meeting energy-efficiency requirements. Building codes allow architects to avoid hurricane-proof windows if they specify plywood shutters at least seven-sixteenths of an inch thick, meant to be hung over windows before a storm. Joseph Sauerwein, the chief fire marshal of the Town of Brookhaven on Long Island, said he thought that in an emergency it might be difficult for rescue workers to get through windows with multiple layers of glass and plastic. ''The windows solve one problem, but they create another,'' he said, adding that for his own new house in Brookhaven he chose wood shutters over missile-tested windows, in part because of fire safety. ''The rules are definitely overkill,'' Mr. Wieboldt said. The builders' institute has asked the state Code Council, which is responsible for building code amendments in New York, to modify them. Mr. Wieboldt said statistics indicated that 120-mile-an-hour winds are unlikely on eastern Long Island. But a 1938 hurricane is believed to have brought gusts up to 130 m.p.h. That storm largely destroyed a Richard Neutra house on Fishers Island which had windows running its whole length. Because a missile test can cost $20,000 or more, hurricane-resistant windows are offered in a limited number of sizes. The largest such picture window made by Marvin is 6 by 6 feet, Mr. Head said. That is a problem for architects whose designs depend on large expanses of glass. ''There are certain kinds of transparent, pavilionlike houses that will be very hard to do,'' said Ali Tayar, a Manhattan architect who recently redesigned a house in Southampton, N.Y., to comply with the 2003 codes. Terence Riley, chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and a partner at Keenen/Riley, is designing two houses in Miami with John Bennett. Both houses feature walls of glass overlooking courtyards. Mr. Riley said that under the new regulations he had to divide large windows into smaller segments. ''The regulations make absolute sense'' in Florida, Mr. Riley said, adding that he thought the government should help pay to test more types of windows. ''The cost of testing right now is prohibitive, leaving too few approved products on the market,'' he said. Mr. Ryall, of Ryall Porter Architects, said that he would use shutters in the Shelter Island house, and that the shutters would be stored in the client's basement. Mr. Tayar said he didn't think that approach would work for his Southampton house. ''You'd have to be there with your hundred pieces of plywood and hang them in hurricane-force winds, which isn't a very good solution, especially if this is your weekend house, and you happen to be in Manhattan,'' he said. Michael K. Walker, a custom-home builder in Sarasota, Fla., said he has built some houses that require as many as 150 plywood shutters, each of which needs to be screwed tightly into place. Some homeowners in the Sarasota area left their shutters in place over the last month, Mr. Walker said. ''There's a plea from the fire department to get these shutters off the buildings,'' he said. ''If people leave their shutters up, and there is a fire, they can't get in to rescue people.''"
"Alfred Morain could hardly summon the words to describe what he experiences when he looks at his land filled with dead nutmeg trees, which Hurricane Ivan felled as it swept over this island three weeks ago, blowing away Mr. Morain's livelihood with it. ''There is real devastation in my heart,'' he said Tuesday, surrounded by his wife and four children outside the 10-by-12-foot wooden shack he calls home. Like thousands of other Grenadians, Mr. Morain is struggling to rebuild amid the wreckage left behind by Ivan, one of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean and the United States in decades. Perhaps no island suffered more damage than Grenada, a relatively prosperous former British colony where tourism and the spice trade are the mainstays of the economy. At least 39 people were killed. Now it is an island where the houses have no roofs and the streets are lined with debris. The winds ripped the tops off of most buildings, destroyed churches and schools, knocked down most of the island's power lines and left corrugated steel roofing littered along the streets like used tissue paper. Looting broke out on the island, twice the size of Washington, D.C., after the storm hit on Sept. 7, damaging at least 90 percent of the buildings and leaving several thousand of the 100,000 residents homeless. To complicate security, the warden of the island's only prison let all the inmates out during the storm. About 200 troops from neighboring countries were shipped in to help the local police quell the looters and track down convicts who did not return voluntarily to prison. Only about a dozen convicts are still at large, said a police spokesman, Troy Garvey. But a dusk-to-dawn curfew remains in place, and troops with automatic weapons still guard banks in St. George's downtown. Government officials and aid workers said clean drinking water and food were still scarce on much of the island, despite deliveries of aid coordinated by the National Emergency Relief Organization. Most residents still lack electricity and telephone lines, they said. All over the island this week, people could be seen putting tarps up to replace lost roofs and hammering together small frame houses that had collapsed in the storm. The high winds and tornadoes spawned by Ivan destroyed the roof and stained-glass windows of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, as well as the prime minister's residence and the governor general's mansion. Several yachts capsized or ran aground in St. George's harbor, a popular destination for avid sailors. Schools are closed indefinitely. Prime Minister Keith C. Mitchell estimated the damage at more than $1 billion. The island's two main crops, cocoa and nutmeg, have been wiped out, and it will take at least a decade to regrow the nutmeg groves. Most of the major tourist hotels were badly damaged as well. Several large airlines, among them Virgin Atlantic, have suspended flights to the island indefinitely. It has been a devastating psychological blow for the residents of this country, where a United States-led invasion in 1983 toppled a military-installed Marxist government. Grenada has seen an average 7 percent growth in its economy for the last nine years and has not been through a major hurricane in more than four decades, Mr. Mitchell said. ''The devastation caused by Ivan was almost total, and as I have indicated to people, the devastation is even worse from a psychological standpoint,'' he said in an interview on Tuesday. ''People have never gone through anything like this, and I think most people had certain plans for their own lives, certain calculations about when they want to retire, when they want to do certain things, what additional things they want to do, the education of their children. And all of a sudden, they see everything that they have just thrown in pieces on the ground.'' Hotel owners and others in the tourist trade were some of the hardest hit. Andre Cherman, a 52-year-old hotelier, woke up after the storm to find Ivan had demolished more than half the rooms in the Coyaba Beach Resort, the three-star hotel that is his pride and joy. The roof is gone. Rubble fills his office and the courtyard. There is still no power or safe water. Mr. Cherman estimates that it will take $6.5 million and at least a year of work to restore his hotel. In the meantime, he has laid off all but a handful of his 95 employees. He is not alone. Most of the tourist hotels on the long, white beach south of St. George's are shuttered indefinitely. ''Everybody's in a state of shock on the island,'' Mr. Cherman said, sitting in his hotel's lobby, surrounded by wreckage. While Mr. Cherman had insurance, many of the 7,500 farmers who depend on nutmeg for a living did not. They have no hope of replanting the trees anytime soon, and it takes a decade for a nutmeg tree to become fruitful. The island normally produces about six million pounds of nutmeg a year. Mr. Morain, the nutmeg farmer, said he would start planting vegetables, bananas and other subsistence crops to feed his children. About three-quarters of his income used to come from the 16 acres of nutmeg trees he tended and harvested every year. It brought in about $3,500 a year, which was just enough to survive on, with some odd jobs to help make ends meet, he said. ''We will have to go back to the land and plant up,'' said the 43-year-old Mr. Morain, surveying piles of brown nutmeg trees behind his house. ''It's the land you understand. That's where the food must come from. Back to square one, man.'' Other nutmeg farmers in the Après Tout area said they were not sure they would be able to start over. One was Harris Phillip, a 73-year-old farmer who has lived off his nutmeg trees for 50 years. He said he was too old to begin anew, too crippled from arthritis. He has no savings. He has no idea how to survive the coming year. ''It's a bad disaster,'' he says, sitting on a hillside, looking over his ruined lands and the Caribbean's deep blue beyond. ''I don't know where to put me hand now. I don't know what to do.''"
"Global warming is likely to produce a significant increase in the intensity and rainfall of hurricanes in coming decades, according to the most comprehensive computer analysis done so far. By the 2080's, seas warmed by rising atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases could cause a typical hurricane to intensify about an extra half step on the five-step scale of destructive power, says the study, done on supercomputers at the Commerce Department's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J. And rainfall up to 60 miles from the core would be nearly 20 percent more intense. Other computer modeling efforts have also predicted that hurricanes will grow stronger and wetter as a result of global warming. But this study is particularly significant, independent experts said, because it used half a dozen computer simulations of global climate, devised by separate groups at institutions around the world. The long-term trends it identifies are independent of the normal lulls and surges in hurricane activity that have been on display in recent decades. The study was published online on Tuesday by The Journal of Climate and can be found at www.gfdl.noaa.gov/reference/bibliography/2004/tk0401.pdf. The new study of hurricanes and warming ''is by far and away the most comprehensive effort'' to assess the question using powerful computer simulations, said Dr. Kerry A. Emanuel, a hurricane expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has seen the paper but did not work on it. About the link between the warming of tropical oceans and storm intensity, he said, ''This clinches the issue.'' Dr. Emanuel and the study's authors cautioned that it was too soon to know whether hurricanes would form more or less frequently in a warmer world. Even as seas warm, for example, accelerating high-level winds can shred the towering cloud formations of a tropical storm. But the authors said that even if the number of storms simply stayed the same, the increased intensity would substantially increase their potential for destruction. Experts also said that rising sea levels caused by global warming would lead to more flooding from hurricanes -- a point underlined at the United Nations this week by leaders of several small island nations, who pleaded for more attention to the potential for devastation from tidal surges. The new study used four climate centers' mathematical approximations of the physics by which ocean heat fuels tropical storms. With almost every combination of greenhouse-warmed oceans and atmosphere and formulas for storm dynamics, the results were the same: more powerful storms and more rainfall, said Robert Tuleya, one of the paper's two authors. He is a hurricane expert who recently retired after 31 years at the fluid dynamics laboratory and teaches at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. The other author was Dr. Thomas R. Knutson of the Princeton laboratory. Altogether, the researchers spawned around 1,300 virtual hurricanes using a more powerful version of the same supercomputer simulations that generates Commerce Department forecasts of the tracks and behavior of real hurricanes. Dr. James B. Elsner, a hurricane expert at Florida State University who was among the first to predict the recent surge in Atlantic storm activity, said the new study was a significant step in examining the impacts of a warmer future. But like Dr. Emanuel, he also emphasized that the extraordinary complexity of the oceans and atmosphere made any scientific progress ''baby steps toward a final answer.''"
"The gigantic hangar where the space shuttle is prepared for its missions sustained much more damage from Hurricane Frances than initially believed, NASA officials said Tuesday. The damage poses further hurdles to the resumption of shuttle flights planned for next spring. Of particular concern is the roof of the 525-foot-high hangar, said James W. Kennedy, the director of the Kennedy Space Center, who led reporters on a tour of the center. A team of about 30 technicians climbed to the roof on Tuesday to assess the damage, but quickly decided to get off. ''It was very insecure, if you will. It was soggy, it was weak and they did not want to run the risk of falling through the roof,'' Mr. Kennedy said, adding that he was not sure what kind of repair might be needed. While the three shuttles themselves were in buildings that did not sustain major damage, the eight-acre hangar, known as the Vehicle Assembly Building, is critical to readying them for flight. It is there that the shuttles are mated to their fuel tanks and solid fuel boosters. A second building, where the shuttle's heat-resistant tiles are manufactured, was also severely damaged by the driving rain and pounding winds. About a quarter of the roof was blown away, Mr. Kennedy said. He added that a full estimate of the damage and a decision on whether the buildings are safe for people to work inside will be made by the end of the week. Robert Mirelson, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington, said that while the situation appeared to be serious, any discussion of delay was premature. ''We're still in the 'too early to tell' phase right now,'' he said. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven in February 2003. Since then, work on a project to expand the orbiting International Space Station, which depended on the shuttle to deliver supplies and heavy equipment, has been virtually halted, and the station's crew has been reduced to two from three. NASA hopes to resume missions to the station with a flight by the shuttle Discovery by March. Besides the damage to the roof of the hangar, Mr. Kennedy said, about 52,500 square feet of aluminum panels on the southern and eastern walls are missing, too. That is causing additional apprehension, since about 25 percent of that wall surface is completely exposed to the elements. Interior lights could be seen from the outside. Nevertheless, Mr. Kennedy said he felt fortunate that the damage was not worse. ''There was a time a week ago when some of us worried about the future of human space flight, at least, with the potential of a loss of orbiter vehicles,'' he said. The shuttle's thermal tiles were formerly manufactured in Palmdale, Calif., but cost-cutting in recent years led NASA to relocate the plant to the Kennedy Space Center. Mr. Kennedy suggested that it might be possible to shift tile manufacturing back to Palmdale. In fact, the Palmdale plant, which is owned by Boeing, started making tiles again early this year as part of the return-to-flight effort, said Ed Memi, a spokesman for Boeing. The tiles have been used for impact testing, but could be used for the shuttles, Mr. Memi said. ''It's all sitting there and ready to go,'' he said. ''Boeing will do whatever they can do to help.'' A building housing computers for the launching control center and other equipment were seriously damaged, but in that case the gear was protected by wrapping it in plastic sheets, Mr. Kennedy said. Asked if the Vehicle Assembly Building could be used to prepare the next generation of spacecraft, Mr. Kennedy said he was unsure. ''I've got to believe whatever new facilities we build will be built with the best technologies and the best design methods that were not a part of the process back in the 60's, when they built the V.A.B.,'' he said. ''But in terms of going in after the fact, and strengthening the V.A.B., I don't know if that's even in the cards.'' John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the building had enjoyed a long streak of good luck that may have run out. ''There was a calculated gamble in 1961 to put this facility at a location that was subject to severe weather,'' he said. ''We've had 33 years of winning with the gamble. Given gamblers' odds, at some point it's going to catch up with you.'' HURRICANE FRANCES: SPACE PROGRAM"
"The big, high-ceilinged exhibition hall here at the Palm Beach County fairgrounds has been turned into what looks like a huge field hospital. No one is critically ill there. But everyone is elderly, and nearly everyone has some kind of health problem. Camped out in rows of neat metal cots, many with wheelchairs parked alongside, they are all refugees from Hurricane Frances. By now most of them know that their homes made it through the storm. But they also know the power is still out, and because they depend on electricity to run oxygen machines and other medical devices, they are stuck here for at least a few more days. They are bored and getting fidgety, they say, but most of all they are grateful that someone came to get them at their mobile home parks and little bungalows as the hurricane was bearing down on Florida last Thursday. And they say the meals, the snacks and the special attention from Red Cross volunteers, the Sheriff's Department and other emergency workers from Palm Beach County have been wonderful. ''I'd rather be home, naturally,'' said Helen Marcone who is 84 and periodically gets help in breathing with a little machine next to her bed. ''But I don't have lights. So what am I going to do? And the treatment here couldn't be nicer.'' For nearly a week, Ms. Marcone's world has been reduced to a cot and a straight-back chair, surrounded by, at one point, about 500 other elderly and frail Floridians, many of them retirees from New York and other states in the East and Midwest. Throughout the great swath of Florida that was pummeled by Hurricane Frances, county governments set up similar shelters for people described in the language of bureaucrats as having ''special needs.'' Tens of thousands of able-bodied Floridians also took shelter in public schools, churches and government buildings. They were able to go home after the winds died down. But many of the elderly simply cannot do without electricity, and across the state hundreds of them are still huddled in auditoriums like the one here. By late Tuesday, about 60 elderly men and women were still here at one of the biggest of the special shelters. The lucky ones have had their electricity restored and have returned home. In Orlando, where about 300 elderly people took shelter, only about 30 remained. Just up the coast in Stuart, 70 elderly people were in the Martin County special shelter, down from nearly 270. ''It's been stressful,'' said Martha Poorbaugh, an official at the Stuart shelter. But she said the elderly people were all doing well. Florida has a higher percentage of residents who are more than 60 years of age than any other state -- 22.5 percent of its 17.4 million residents. It has developed a network dedicated to the welfare of its elderly. It keeps a registry of older people with medical problems, and when a hurricane is brewing, officials gather the elderly in shelters staffed with doctors, nurses and volunteers. The state regards the special centers as essential for older people. ''If they lose power,'' said Jean Creamer, the coordinator of the center set up here by Palm Beach County, ''by the time someone finds them in their home, they could be gone.'' This afternoon, Al Ritchie, a 68-year-old retired real estate agent, sat in his wheelchair with his legs propped on his cot, two little tubes feeding oxygen into his nostrils. He lives in a trailer in Lake Worth, south of here, and said he was ordered to evacuate. ''I made a phone call to the Palm Beach County elders support system and they sent out a van for me,'' Mr. Ritchie recalled. In many cases the county officials took the first step. ''They called us Thursday morning and said they were coming to get us,'' said Ruth Thomas, who is 68 and moved to Boynton Beach with her husband, David, eight years ago after spending their lives in upstate New York around Glens Falls. Mrs. Thomas gets around fine, but Mr. Thomas suffers with severe emphysema and spends most of his time on his back. The exhibition halls looks like a fortress from outside. But during the storm it was eerie inside, said Sarah King, a retired professor at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain. ''You heard the wind sort of whistling,'' Ms. King said, ''and at one time there was water streaming down from the ceiling.'' William Peters, a captain in the Palm Beach County Fire and Rescue, was worried, too. But he unplugged a drain pipe and stopped the leak. Max Rothman, the director of the Center on Aging at Florida International University in Miami, said Florida has been a leader in services for older people. But he said, ''as far as funding it's been constant catch-up.'' But if there was any shortage of money in the system, it did not show at the fair grounds shelter. Don Cushman, who is a retired professor of corporate communication at the New York State University at Albany and uses a breathing machine when he sleeps, raved about the food. He is married to Ms. King. ''My wife and I still fly around the world consulting,'' Mr. Cushman said. ''We're in the same field. This is the most unusual first-rate place I've ever seen. The food here is a cut above most of the restaurants in this area.'' ''The government never seems to do anything well,'' he said. ''But they've done this exceedingly well.'' HURRICANE FRANCES: THE SHELTERS"
"Hurricane Amnesia is not the name of a storm. It's a form of memory loss that develops in the wake of a significant hurricane. The storm is remembered, especially for the very real suffering of its victims, but the lessons that should be drawn from it often are not. Thanks to Hurricanes Charley and Frances, Florida has had an unwelcome chance to rediscover things it has learned before. Preparing for a hurricane doesn't mean just boarding up windows and getting out of town. It means much tougher building codes, like the ones that several counties still have on the books. A tougher statewide code would mean tougher structures, and that would mean a better chance of standing up to hurricane-force winds. Every time a hurricane strikes Florida -- or any place else, for that matter -- it performs an instant analysis of construction quality. Nothing is foolproof, of course, but buildings designed to more demanding standards do stand up better to big storms. And every time a hurricane strikes Florida, it creates a tsunami in the insurance business, spreading the costs to all the rest of us. Tougher standards mean slightly higher building costs, but that keeps the costs where they belong. Florida is a big target, and it sits right in the hurricane zone. That means it should be building in a way that is appropriate to the risk. Some people argue that global warming may lead to storms of greater strength and volatility in the near future. Florida cannot afford to wait to find out. It has already faced two hurricanes this year, and a third, Ivan, could be headed its way at the moment, with the potential of more storms to come. Damaging hurricanes have historically been intermittent enough in Florida to create an illusion of at least temporary safety, especially for a population that includes regular infusions of new residents who may never have experienced one. But it is not residents' responsibility alone to recognize that it is no longer good enough to rely on the illusion of safe enough for now. It's time for the authorities in Florida to start building for sooner or later."
"Residents of the aging Causeway Mobile Home Park on the Indian River here suffered plenty from Hurricane Frances. Roofs fell, walls crumbled, debris blew into tiny aluminum living rooms. And then there is that smell. ''They usually don't get it,'' said Larry Benning, a supervisor at the Fort Pierce Utilities Authority sewage treatment plant next door. The aroma arrived in force on Tuesday, as the plant resumed operations after losing power during Hurricane Frances, leaving a buildup of bacteria and adding malodor to the ill winds of the storm that struck over the weekend. It was yet another example of how vast power losses and infrastructure problems are defining what in hurricane country is known simply as ''the aftermath.'' While the structural damage from the hurricane was not nearly as acute as that caused in August by the smaller but more powerful Hurricane Charley, the latest storm -- with its enormous size, its lumbering progress and its drenching rains -- has left an enduring calamity for millions. After the storm plodded ashore on Saturday, about 4.5 million customers lost power. By 4 p.m. on Tuesday, according to the State Emergency Response Team, about half of them were still in the dark. Only 23 percent of customers in St. Lucie County and 13 percent in Indian River County, two of the hardest-hit areas, had power restored. In Palm Beach County, 32 percent of customers had power, the agency said. Nearly one million land-line phone customers lacked service, while about 75 percent of wireless customers had service. Schools were scheduled to be closed Wednesday in 24 counties, the emergency team said. Flooding, downed power lines and erosion closed many state and local roads in central Florida and along the east coast in Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River Counties. ''Boil water'' notices were in effect for parts or all of eight counties; at least two hospitals were closed; mandatory evacuations were in effect for mobile home parks and other parts of 17 counties; curfews were being enforced, sometimes inconsistently, in all or parts of 23 counties. Four deaths have been attributed to the storm. Without power, many gas stations were closed, and lines stretched blocks from those that were open. The state said that ports had reopened and that about 125 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel would be delivered to port and fuel storage facilities by Wednesday. ''I've got a bunch of accounts that are waiting for me right now,'' said Aaron Sowa, 25, a landscaper who was idling in his Jeep a few blocks from an Amoco station on U.S. 1 in Vero Beach. ''I used up all my gas for the lawn equipment on the generator.'' While problems were disparate and widespread, said Marta Casas-Celaya, a spokeswoman for Bell South in Miami, ''the major issue, first and foremost, is power.'' She said that the phone company's remote terminals had eight-hour backup power and that some were running on generators. The continued power loss prompted questions about how well the state and utilities were responding after the recent experience with Hurricane Charley, which struck southwest Florida on Aug. 13. A spokesman for Florida Power and Light, which serves 35 of the state's 67 counties and most of those that were hardest hit, said Tuesday that the latest storm proved that every hurricane required a customized response. While Hurricane Charley ripped a relatively clean and narrow line northeast from Punta Gorda, Hurricane Frances's wide, sodden stumble west and northward delayed plans the utility had to send in reinforcement crews from out of state and from places in Florida not projected to be hit. ''You can't count on that it's going to hit just one particular part of your service area,'' said Mayco Villafana, spokesman for Florida Power and Light, when asked what lessons might be learned from the two storms. ''It could be all of it.'' Hurricane aftermaths may seem an inevitable collage of tragic clichés and clip art by now: No power, no water, no phones. Old people withering alone in the summer heat without air-conditioning, poor people forgotten and without access to help, big yachts washed onto broken docks. But the other side of the aftermath is one that county, state and federal officials say they are always seeking to refine: the swiftness and precision of their response to the storm. Hurricane Andrew, which ravaged Miami and surrounding Dade County in 1992 and caused $27 billion in damage, prompted greater state attention to disaster response and relief. The state now has a Web site, www.floridadisaster.org, that is updated frequently with storm and relief information. But for all the warning, the state remains deeply vulnerable, with fragile mobile home parks, inconsistent building codes for new construction and a persistent need to educate a constantly changing and sometimes indifferent population. Mr. Villafana, of Florida Power and Light, suggested that rapid residential growth had complicated recovery efforts, too, increasing the potential number of people who could be affected. He also said the rush of people wanting to return home had made it difficult for power-crew convoys to get where they were going, adding that the utility might ask for state escorts. He was reluctant to draw immediate conclusions on lessons learned. ''We're right in the middle of the battle right now,'' Mr. Villafana said. ''We'll have time to debrief.'' HURRICANE FRANCES: THE OVERVIEW"
"A shaken Florida began bracing Wednesday for the possibility of its second major hurricane in less than a month, with people up and down the state's eastern coast lunging for emergency supplies even as it remained impossible to predict where the storm would strike. With the best predictions suggesting a landfall north of Palm Beach County, regions along the central coast planned evacuations, ordered schools and courts closed and told residents of barrier islands to head inland as early as Thursday morning. Yet people in Orlando and other inland communities, which are still cleaning up from Hurricane Charley last month, were told to stay vigilant, too. The heaps of debris still piled on their curbs could become dangerous projectiles if Hurricane Frances passes through, officials warned. ''I can't emphasize enough how powerful this is,'' Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said at a news conference. ''If there's something out there that's going to weaken it, we haven't seen it.'' The storm was packing winds of up to 140 miles an hour as it approached the Bahamas on Wednesday evening, and forecasters said it could grow to a Category 5 hurricane before hitting the southeastern seaboard as soon as Friday night. Though forecasters said there was a chance that the storm could change course and hit Georgia or South Carolina instead, they said Florida looked increasingly like the target. Since the storm is much broader than Hurricane Charley, they said, it could hit a much larger area. In an afternoon news conference in Tallahassee, Gov. Jeb Bush said that it was too early to expect the storm with certainty, but that the state was better prepared than usual because of its recent battering. He and other officials seemed worried about the possibility of anxious people crowding the highways in efforts to flee the storm that might prove fruitless. ''If you're not on the coast or in a flood zone or in a mobile home, you may be safest by staying where you are and making sure that you're protected,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I hope that after Charley, people now realize the powerful nature of these storms.'' People were indeed taking the threat seriously, if the long lines for plywood ($15.75 a sheet at one Home Depot outlet here), batteries, water, gasoline, charcoal grills and plastic tarps were any indication. Many grocery stores were out of water by early afternoon, and generators and inland hotel rooms were disappearing. Palm Beach County officials told about 300,000 residents of coastal areas to evacuate by 2 p.m. Thursday, and said they would open emergency shelters by then. Officials in Brevard County, home of Cape Canaveral, said they would advise nearly 200,000 people to evacuate mobile homes and barrier islands starting Thursday, while Martin County, just north of Palm Beach, planned to ask about 7,500 residents of vulnerable areas to leave. The threat comes less than three weeks after Hurricane Charley tore across the state on Aug. 13, from Punta Gorda, on the southwestern coast, to Daytona Beach. That storm, which took thousands of people off guard because it was predicted to hit farther north, around Tampa, left at least $7 billion worth of damage and was blamed for 27 deaths. Mr. Bush tried to paint as an advantage the fact that Florida was still recovering from its last storm, pointing out that officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were still here helping victims of Hurricane Charley. Shawn Longway, who bought $200 worth of plywood to protect the windows of a mattress store in downtown Orlando, said he was being much more proactive this time. ''I'm trying not to overreact,'' Mr. Longway, 39, said. ''But it's headed right for us and we saw the first time what it did. I used to live in Miami, and people generally don't take it as seriously here as they should. But they are now.'' It was still early enough for others to find humor in the situation, like an Orlando D.J. who despaired on the air that his city was getting a ''twin spin'' and a young man leaving a coffeehouse who told a friend, ''If I don't see you before the hurricane, I'll see you in heaven.'' Dan Pierson of Orlando said he had to drink a few beers before heading out to buy plywood at Home Depot, where he guarded his investment by lying on it while he waited for a friend to drive up. Though his house was untouched by the last storm, he said, trees destroyed many of his neighbors' roofs. ''Charley went through in a couple hours, and this one's going to last up to 24,'' Mr. Pierson, 39, said. ''After not seeing any storms in Orlando for 17 years, I just can't believe I'm going to see two in a row.'' Officials in the Bahamas said the storm was likely to pass over the island of North Eleuthera, about 70 miles west of Nassau, on Thursday night and Friday morning. Shelters have been set up and security forces have all been put on alert, the officials said. Fred Mitchell, the foreign minister of the Bahamas, said in an interview that people in Nassau were apprehensive because of reports of high winds. ''We've got codes for our housing built to withstand 120 miles an hour,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''But they say this storm has winds of 140 miles an hour. So people here are apprehensive.'' In some neighborhoods damaged by the last storm, a sense of world-weariness prevailed as people scrambled to finish repairs or at least cover the holes that remained in their roofs and walls. Some admitted they wished the new storm would hit the Carolinas instead. ''We've already had our share of misery,'' said Rahaat Sharma of Orlando, who spent her day shopping for water, diapers and batteries. ''We don't deserve another storm. Why can't it go somewhere else?''"
"THERE'S an old truth about hurricanes: they take out the trees that gardeners don't have the heart to cut down. Like wildfires, they clear the land of deadwood. They fell trees weakened by disease or stunted roots, leaving only the strongest -- or the luckiest -- when skies clear. Such ruthless pruning not only reveals which plants can stand up to a 100-mile-an-hour wind, but suddenly opens up a view long forgotten. ''When I saw the garden the day after Charley, my first thought was, 'Oh, the vistas,' '' David Price, the director of horticulture at Historic Bok Sanctuary in Lake Wales, Fla., said, speaking about five weeks after Hurricane Charley crossed the state. The 250-acre garden sits on top of Iron Mountain, at 298 feet above sea level the highest point in the state. From there Mr. Price looked south, through a grove of old live oaks that had held steady through the winds, toward 1,700 acres of orange groves in the valley below. To the west Mountain Lake shimmered through a tree line thinned by half in the storm. ''Now I'm tempted to cut down a few more oaks blocking the view,'' he said. Just before Hurricane Ivan smashed through Pensacola in mid-September, gardeners in central Florida and along the coast were beginning to lift their heads from clearing the wreckage of fallen trees and mangled shrubbery left by Charley, which roared by on Aug. 13, and Frances, which crawled through three weeks later. In many places Charley and Frances took 70 percent of the canopy, stripping live oaks of their leaves, felling weaker trees like laurel oaks, snapping branches off magnolias and leaving camellias and other shade-loving shrubs to scalding sun. Gardeners who are still ''picking up sticks,'' as they say -- big ones -- are being forced to think anew about the sorts of plants that might best go in the bare spaces. No hurricanes have swept through Lake Wales since Donna, in 1960. ''But meteorologists studying rising temperatures and weather patterns think we may be seeing more hurricanes the next two decades,'' Mr. Price said. No plant is hurricaneproof, as attested by all the native live oaks that went down, despite their reputation for being able to survive storms. Bok lost 23, including one 80-footer that crashed into the reflecting pool. The McKee Botanical Garden in Vero Beach, Fla., lost about a dozen live oaks, some 300 years old, in its jungle hammock. The trees were shallow-rooted, growing over limestone. Two tall slash pines, natives that usually just bend with the wind, were lifted out of the soft, saturated soil and crashed into a pool at the entrance. ''I'm going to miss those big old slash pines,'' said Janet Alford, the executive director. At Mounts Botanical Garden, a 14-acre public garden in West Palm Beach, the director, Allen Sistrunk, mourned the downing of his tamarind and sapodilla trees, but saw the opportunity posed by the loss of three 70-foot eucalyptus trees. ''They were planted too close together,'' he said. ''Now we may only upright one of them, the white eucalyptus, which glows at night.'' And across the flattened trees, Mr. Sistrunk now enjoys a view of three regal queen palms on the south side of the garden. Palm trees hold up beautifully in storms: their limber trunks bend with the wind, which blows right through their fronds. So savvy Floridians know they shouldn't believe any tree company that shows up just before hurricane season to prune their palms. ''Hurricane pruning is a racket,'' Mr. Sistrunk said. ''I've seen palm trees pruned to a Q-Tip.'' Take too many fronds off, and you deprive the palm of its ability to photosynthesize, actually hurting its chances in a hurricane. Unpruned sabal palms have done fine for centuries without help from the knife. Paurotis palms, native to the Everglades, have also evolved with the high winds of seasonal storms, which do them the favor of cleaning out their dead brown fronds. Ficus trees, on the other hand, develop massive trunks and dense canopies that catch the wind like sails, so they can topple over and do great damage during a storm. Such trees should be pruned judiciously. Some ficus trees put down aerial roots from their lateral branches as an anchor to the ground. Prune too many, and you destabilize the tree. Live oaks, which grow slowly, generally do well, because they have dense wood and roots that can spread 150 feet -- unless they are growing over limestone rock, as at coastal gardens like McKee and Mounts. The live oaks that went down at Bok had insufficient roots or weak points in their trunks where two branches had grown together but had not fused, Mr. Price said. Old, weakened trees could well be growing in your yard, leaning over the house or car -- and high winds aren't confined to hurricane zones. All such trees should be examined carefully, by a certified arborist if possible, to avoid damage in the next storm. Advice on finding a certified arborist is available from the International Society of Arboriculture, www.isa-arbor.com or (217) 355-9411. But left to their natural form, live oaks have dense interlocking wood that is nearly impossible to cut down. ''You have to tear it,'' Mr. Price said. That is why the hulls of ships, like Old Ironsides, were built of it. So if you have the climate, the room and the time to watch a live oak spread out in your yard, it's a magnificent shade tree well worth planting. But customers are already appearing at nurseries like Rockledge Gardens, near Cocoa Beach, Fla., demanding fast-growing trees. ''They say, 'I want my shade back,' '' said Kevin Reilly, the owner. They ask for laurel oaks, sycamores, Chinese elms, all the fast growers that tend to have weak wood. Many want instant shade to protect their camellias, but no tree can grow fast enough to keep the sun from scalding the camellia's lustrous green leaves. At Harry P. Leu Gardens overlooking Lake Rowena in Orlando, a collection of 2,500 camellias, all selected before 1940, are now frying in the sun. The garden lost 135 large trees, including laurel oaks, sweet gums and pines. ''So we will probably move things around a bit,'' said Robert Bowden, the executive director, and plant some sasanqua camellias, ''which can take the sun.'' Many of the camellias look hopelessly mangled, with broken limbs and a few green leaves on stumps. But if the trunk has not been gouged too deeply the branches can be pruned, and new growth will burgeon. ''There were some little miracles,'' Mr. Bowden said, pointing to a great laurel oak still standing close to the house, built in 1888. Laurel oaks grow fast and offer generous shade, so they were frequently planted in these parts. But with their weak, brittle wood, Mr. Bowden advises against using them. He pointed out one old laurel oak leaning across a walkway that perhaps should be cut down. The ground was soft around the trunk and slightly higher on one side: telling signs for the homeowner trying to secure the yard against the next storm. Mr. Bowden worries that people with felled trees will rush to plant fast-growing species like the camphor or the goldenrain tree for quick shade. But both are invasive, growing like weeds, and should be avoided. The garden's Web site (www .leugardens.org) lists storm-resistant trees like bald and palm cypress, palms, Southern magnolia, holly, live oak, river birch, yaupon holly, white cedar and trident maple. Susceptible trees include Chinese elm, laurel oak, silk floss, hickory, Southern red cedar and sycamore. ''Some people are just planting palms,'' said Mr. Reilly of Rockledge Gardens. And though no landscape is stormproof, a yard planted with saw palmetto, coontie (an American cycad) and sabal palms could be not only striking and low-maintenance, but fairly secure in a hurricane. And tropical plants like calatheas, with their strikingly patterned leaves, and lily pad begonias grow so low that they can ride out a storm. Mr. Bowden was amazed at how well his Southern magnolias had held up, despite the size of their big leaves and the density of their canopies. He stood by a lustrous specimen of D. D. Blanchard, a variety of Magnolia grandiflora, which has shiny green leaves with orange-brown, feltlike undersides, and declared that more people should plant them. The Southern magnolia is a native of the coastal plain. So is the live oak. But life is risky. Especially in a hurricane. NATURE Correction: September 30, 2004, Thursday An article last Thursday about the impact of Hurricane Charley on Historic Bok Sanctuary in Lake Wales, Fla., attributed a distinction to the sanctuary erroneously. It is not the highest point in the state; that is Britton Hill, in Lakewood Park in Walton County, 345 feet above sea level."
"The remnants of Hurricane Jeanne drenched a broad swath of the New York region yesterday, as a tornado touched down in Cherry Hill, N.J., damaging several buildings, rainfall set records across New York City, and numerous roads were flooded. The National Weather Service said last night that a tornado with winds of 70 miles per hour had touched down late in the afternoon in Cherry Hill, confirming witness accounts of a funnel cloud that had damaged several buildings and cars. No injuries were reported. The Associated Press said a church, a drugstore and a bank were among 11 buildings damaged as the tornado cut a two-mile swath through Cherry Hill. The rains, which were heaviest in New Jersey, disrupted flights at all three major airports, with the longest delays -- over three hours -- at Newark Liberty International Airport. In New York City, the heaviest rain began in the late afternoon. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Brookhaven said 3.6 inches had fallen on Central Park by midnight, beating the previous record accumulation for Sept. 28, 1.35 inches in 1974. Other records for the day were set across the city and its suburbs. The National Weather Service said that 2.67 inches fell at Kennedy International Airport yesterday, more than double the previous record of .75 inches on Sept. 28, 1997. Newark was drenched in 2.5 inches of rain, beating the previous record of one inch on Sept. 28, 2003, and Bridgeport had 1.48 inches, compared with its previous record of .96 inches on Sept. 28, 1974. Officials said that the downpours, coming as people slogged their way to trains and buses and as drivers plowed through deep pools of standing water, resulted in long delays but no widespread breakdown in the evening commute. Several subway lines, including the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 in Manhattan, and the F and V in Queens, were halted sporadically because of water on the tracks. The city's Office of Emergency Management said low-lying sections of highways across the city were flooded, with 18 inches of standing water in the northbound lane of the Henry Hudson Parkway near Dyckman Street, and scattered flooding on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, the Belt Parkway and elsewhere. The rain was heaviest in New Jersey. By 10:30 p.m., accumulations had reached 3.18 inches in Teterboro, 2.5 inches at Newark Airport, and 4.73 inches in Trenton, the National Weather Service said. Drivers encountered severe flooding on roads across New Jersey, including Route 10 in Livingston, Route 29 in Hopewell, and Route 17 in Lodi. In regions already stricken by earlier storms that left flooded basements, business losses and frayed nerves in their wake, residents appeared to hunker down under wave after wave of rainfall that continued into the early morning. Shortly before midnight, Man Singh, the clerk at a Getty Mart convenience store in North Bergen, sat under an umbrella that was mounted on top of his cash register inside the store. The roof had sprung a leak directly above where Mr. Singh sold his customers cigarettes, soda, chips and gasoline. He offered a philosophical note. ''Yes, we want it to stop,'' he said. ''But can we stop the rain? No we can't.'' Not far away in Jersey City, Wagid Ahmed, pumped gas under a downpour at a Mobil station on John F. Kennedy Boulevard, and his patience was wearing thin. ''Water, water, water, and afterward I get sick,'' he said."
"Schools and courts have closed for weeks on end. Roads, bridges, restaurants and hotels are in tatters, crops laid to waste and polling places for the coming election destroyed. Four back-to-back hurricanes have made normalcy ever more elusive in Florida, where intensive relief efforts cannot get traction helping people and whole industries cope. The logistical and financial hurdles are staggering: the Federal Emergency Management Agency has received more than 611,000 applications for assistance, and has been screening them at more than 60 recovery centers around the state. Though the agency delivered more than $330 million to individuals and businesses before Hurricane Jeanne blew through last weekend, thousands of applicants are still waiting. The agency's phone lines were inundated even before the latest storm, which dealt a second or even third blow to many homes, farms and businesses in Central Florida. On Monday alone, it received 19,000 initial requests from Hurricane Jeanne victims, 3,200 from Hurricane Ivan victims, 3,954 from Hurricane Frances victims and 809 from Hurricane Charley victims, officials said. The storms struck on Sept. 26, Sept. 16, Sept. 4 and Aug. 13. At FEMA's main operations center here, postings remind workers how to recognize ''stress overload'' in themselves and count down the days until hurricane season ends (62 as of Tuesday). Many callers have found the agency's toll-free line busy in recent weeks, and many more are waiting to hear back from overwhelmed insurance companies. ''FEMA said, 'We'll have to get back to you after your insurance company helps you,''' said Charles Sweeney, 71, whose home in Barefoot Bay, near Vero Beach, was battered by two storms. ''But the insurance company said, 'You'll have to wait.' I've been real nice about it, but I ain't going to be nice no more.'' Every time the state has dragged itself out from under a storm, another has hit within weeks, thwarting efforts to restore power, remove debris, repair infrastructure and mend the economy, until now one of the nation's healthiest. ''We need to get back to the recovery phase of this and get out of preparation and relief,'' an exasperated Gov. Jeb Bush told reporters in Brevard County, parts of which were ravaged by Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne, on Monday. ''With a little bit of time, we can start developing strategies to recover. Which is to get visitors back in our state who don't come in big utility trucks, instead they come and rent cars and they stay in hotels and go to attractions. To jump-start our economy, which will have been hurt significantly by this.'' Time and again, Mr. Bush and other officials also find themselves trying to jump-start the morale of people who feel flattened by the disruptions, and to reason with them. School superintendents have asked Mr. Bush to cancel the FCAT, the state's main standardized test, because so much instruction time has been lost. Schools in about 30 of the state's 67 counties were closed Tuesday; Pensacola schools, which have been out since Sept. 14, may not reopen until Oct. 11. Mr. Bush has agreed to delay the test in some counties, but has so far rejected the idea of skipping it this year. Another angry group, farmers, found some comfort last week when the federal government announced it would provide $500 million in agricultural relief aid. Hurricanes Charley and Frances inflicted about $2 billion worth of damage on crucial crops like citrus and nursery plants, officials say; damage from the more recent storms is still being tallied. Tourism, the state's most lucrative industry, has been hobbled, with officials wondering how to persuade convention and other group planners to continue booking events here during the six-month hurricane season. Some businesses might reconsider the wisdom of having field offices in Florida, like American Express, which warned customers last week that payments might not be processed promptly. Yet Mr. Bush and some economists have predicted that Florida's fiscal health will not suffer for long, partly because rebuilding often helps economies. ''Natural disasters have permanent effects only in stagnant economies,'' said Antonio Jorge, an economics professor at Florida International University in Miami, ''and certainly Florida's isn't one of them.'' Residents have fumed not only about the pace of federal assistance, but also about power restoration, provided mostly by Florida Power and Light but also several smaller companies. As of Tuesday morning, power had been returned to 44 percent of the 2.8 million customers who lost it during Hurricane Jeanne and 92 percent of the 443,500 who lost it during Hurricane Ivan. Utility companies, all too aware of the resentment aimed their way, scrambled to recruit crews from as far away as California for the latest restoration effort, which is moving somewhat faster than earlier ones. Perhaps because its operation is so large, FEMA appears the target of the most complaints, even as it continues to dole out ice, water, food, tarps and checks. President Bush asked Congress on Monday for an additional $7.1 billion for relief in the wake of Hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne, bringing the total sought so far to more than $12 billion. The money would go not only to Florida, but also to other states hit by the storms. Congress has so far approved only the initial $2 billion that the White House requested after Hurricane Charley. A second request for $3.1 billion is tied up in talks between the House and Senate and is entangled with more than $3 billion in drought relief sought by farm-state lawmakers of both parties. In a sign of how many homes the storms left uninhabitable, about 800 families are living in ''travel trailers'' provided by FEMA and more than 10,000 people remained in shelters as of Tuesday morning. At FEMA's disaster recovery center in Kissimmee, near Orlando, Terry Newby, a high school teacher whose roof was pummeled by three storms, said some of the agency's policies baffled him. ''They tell me to get two contractors' proposals, but you can't get any contractors to come out,'' said Mr. Newby, 53, of Kissimmee. ''I am feeling very frustrated, not knowing where to go.'' Claire Sheaffer, a single mother who works for the state health department, said roof damage forced her to move out of her house after Hurricane Frances, but that she was still waiting for FEMA representatives to visit. They told her to keep the air-conditioning on to prevent mold, a luxury she cannot afford given the circumstances, she said. ''I applied to FEMA four days after Charley and they still have not come out to my house,'' Ms. Sheaffer said. ''After the first storm I was handing out food and forms for FEMA, but now I am on the other side of the desk.''"
"Hurricane Ivan lashed Jamaica on Friday with powerful winds and driving rains, knocking down power lines and trees and ripping off tin roofs, as officials in Florida stepped up their efforts to evacuate the Florida Keys. ''Ivan is definitely here,'' Evan Thompson, a division chief at the national meteorological service in Kingston said an interview with Radio Jamaica. ''We are definitely in the midst of a hurricane.'' At 11 p.m., the eye of the hurricane was 35 miles south of Kingston and maximum sustained winds had increased to almost 155 miles per hour, with higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported. The center described it as ''an extremely dangerous hurricane'' that was approaching Category 5 strength, a storm with winds greater than 155 m.p.h. As heavy rain blanketed Kingston, the capital, gunshots were heard and there were unconfirmed reports of looting. In the resort town of Montego Bay, the police said they had arrested several people for looting. In the hills above Kingston, the downpour touched off mudslides that blocked roads. Barbara Carby, director general of the country's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told Radio Jamaica her agency had received ''many, many calls'' from people who had lost roofs. Her advice: ''Get in a closet or the bathtub and pull mattresses over you.'' Following on the heels of Hurricanes Charley and Frances, Hurricane Ivan is the third powerful storm to plow through the Caribbean and southern Atlantic in the past four weeks. Already, weary and frustrated residents of Florida were bracing for yet another hit even as they continued to try to restore power and clean up damage from last week's storm, while residents and tourists in Jamaica were praying that Hurricane Ivan's powerful winds would not damage that island the way it did Grenada earlier in the week. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro declared an islandwide hurricane watch. In Kingston, the streets were empty as night fell except for a few cars scurrying for cover past boarded and taped storefronts and homes. At the request of Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, a state of emergency went into effect expanding police powers. In Kingston and other towns and cities earlier, the authorities said they were having difficulty persuading residents in low-lying areas to leave their homes for shelter. But in Montego Bay and other resort towns on the north coast, about 15,000 stranded tourists from the United States and other countries gladly agreed to move from waterfront hotels to heavily fortified concrete and steel resorts inland. As the storm intensified, hotels around the country ordered guests from their rooms, many of them with floor to ceiling glass walls, and herded them into the safety of central ballrooms and dining areas. ''I think this is going to be a bad one,'' said Butch Stewart, chairman of Sandals Resorts, the largest hotel group in Jamaica, and chairman of Air Jamaica, the national flag airline. Mr. Stewart, reached by telephone in Miami, had gone there after starting repairs to his hotels in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas that were damaged by Hurricane Charley last week. While Jamaica and Florida braced for Hurricane Ivan, rescue workers continued to try to get into Grenada, the tiny island in the southern Caribbean where more than 20 people died earlier this week as the stormed wrecked hundreds of homes and businesses. A State Department official said Friday evening that by midmorning Saturday, planes would begin airlifting American citizens out of the devastated island to Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago. Roughly 1,500 Americans were on the island when Hurricane Ivan hit, the official said. About one-third of those were medical students studying at the American medical college in Grenada, St. George's University School of Medicine, said Jerry Cammarata, a doctor at Coney Island Hospital who has been in touch with the students' families. In Florida, the highway out of the Keys was clogged with residents in cars and trucks heading north out of harm's way. In Miami and other cities, people were rushing around to grocery and hardware stores to restock on water, canned food and batteries for flashlights and portable radios. Long lines formed at gasoline stations as drivers topped off their tanks. Ken Seiffer, 42, from Key West, was at a gas station in Marathon on Friday afternoon, waiting to get gas with his wife and two children. ''We're leaving, heading up toward Orlando where we have family,'' he said. ''We've boarded up and secured everything so now it's time to go ahead and evacuate.'' Two of the three hospitals in the Keys were being evacuated, the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West and the Fishermen's Hospital in Marathon. In Montego Bay, Horace Peterkin, manager of Sandals Montego Bay and a vice president of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourism Association, was getting the last of his guests out of his beachfront resort and keeping an eye on developments around the country. He said he understood the government was preparing to forcibly evacuate some residents in dangerous areas. ""A lot of people are still clinging to their houses and possessions,'' Mr. Peterkin said. One reason people were unwilling to leave their homes, he said, was memories of looting during and after Hurricane Gilbert, the last powerful storm to hit Jamaica, 16 years ago. The mood of Jamaica, he said, has shifted from widespread denial, based on 50 years of watching all but two big hurricanes skirt the island at what seemed to be the last minute, to very serious concern. ''Everybody is very, very nervous,'' Mr. Peterkin said. Early this afternoon, Tameka Cato, 17, was walking as fast as she could toward safety in her family's church, the nearby Kingdom Hall of Jehovahs Witness, with two younger brothers and her 7-year-old sister, Sangean, trying to keep up. Their parents planned to join them later. Sangean in blue jeans and powder blue shirt was hefting a pink backpack stuffed with clothing and the others carried sacks of water and food along the deserted street. Nearly every business was shuttered in Kingston. But the tiny, gritty L & K Restaurant & Bar on Half Way Tree Road was open and so was Taylor's Funeral Home on East Street. Elvis Gayle, one of the undertakers at the funeral home, said he had come in to help Ken Anderson, the caretaker, take down a sign that the wind might have blown away. They were determined to maintain the funeral home policy of being available to bereaved families 24 hours a day, every day, clear skies or not. ''Probably nobody is going to come out during the hurricane,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''But we're staying open just in case.'' Keith Sturridge, the burly owner of the bar, said he figured his business, with its concrete block structure and steel security bars on the windows, was a safer bet for riding out Hurricane Ivan than his 70-year-old home. He said he figured if he was going to be in the bar, he might as well be ready for business. The counter stools and all the booths were empty in midafternoon as a light rain washed the front of the building. But Andre Jones, 30, a construction worker, and two other men were staying dry, just under the eaves of the bar's roof. They laughed at the thought that like hundreds of thousands of evacuating Floridians, they might try to get out of the path of the storm. People could get away from the beaches in Jamaica to places like the restaurant , they said. But after that, there was no place to go on an island that was 150 miles long and 50 miles wide. None of them had the money for a flight to Florida and the thought of that made them chuckle, too. ''Florida is all mashed up and it's going to get hit again,'' Mr. Jones said. ''What good is it going to do you to go there?''"
"Battered by Hurricane Charley, deluged by Hurricane Frances and with yet another huge hurricane, named Ivan, approaching from the south, residents of this town of 6,000 are getting pretty weary of multiple climatic assaults. If Hurricane Ivan turns toward Florida in the next few days after deadly head-on blows to Grenada and Jamaica, it will be the first time in 40 years that three hurricanes have made landfall here in a single season, according to statistics provided by the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''We're sick enough, we're heading out,'' said Stu Myers, 43, a maintenance rating program specialist for the Florida Department of Transportation, who on Friday was planning to flee with his wife and children to South Carolina in his new Chevy truck. ''That's what we do now: hurricanes. We're calling this 'hurricane leaving.' This ain't no vacation.'' Officials have not issued evacuation notices for this part of the state; only the 79,000 residents of Key West have been urged to flee. Fort Meade sits close to where the paths of Hurricanes Charley and Frances crossed, in Central Florida 58 miles east of Tampa. Piles of brown, splintered trees and brush line every street; City Hall, its windows boarded up for protection when Hurricane Frances came through on Sunday, still wears its pocked armor, should yet another hurricane visit. ''The people are stressed with the multiple storms,'' said Mayor Robert Elliott, 51, whose own home was flattened by a gigantic oak from the winds of Hurricane Charley. ''Through the first storm, everybody was pretty upbeat and thankful; they had tree damage, maybe shingle damage, but not a loss of life,'' Mr. Elliott said. Then, he continued, ''another one came -- that's where the psychological effect is.'' He said more than 60 percent of Fort Meade's homes were damaged in the storms. Adding to the burden is serious damage to the town's economy and the area has lost 40 percent to 60 percent of its most important crop, citrus. In addition, residents have endured prolonged power failures, flooding, mud and clouds of mosquitoes. On top of that are the rodents, snakes and raccoons, whose natural habitat is underwater. ''Weary is the term,'' said Susan Walker, 49, who was working at The Strawberry Patch, a florist and gift shop along Fort Meade's main street. ''It's been an emotional roller coaster. You wonder what else can befall you.'' Ms. Walker said stressed friends and relatives are depressing enough, but minor irritations are equally maddening, like her permanently dark home, which survived the two storms but whose windows remain boarded up with plywood. ''You wake up, you're all boarded up and you don't want to get up. The inside of the house is dark,'' she explained. ''My husband said, 'I'm going to paint you some stars on the inside of that plywood,' so I'll know when it's nighttime.''"
"Hurricane Ivan pummeled and paralyzed the central Gulf Coast late Wednesday and early Thursday as it surged toward the broad bay here with a ferocity not seen in the region since Hurricane Camille struck to the west in 1969. By Wednesday evening giant waves, measured at 53 feet by automated buoys offshore, were rumbling onto the barrier beaches and islands south of this city of 198,000. ''It's going to be extreme damage,'' said Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center. At midnight central time, hurricane-force winds raked the region and more than eight inches of rain had fallen in some areas along the Alabama coast, and only worse lay ahead, with 30 hours of such conditions expected over a broad swath of the coast. The ragged but explosively powerful eye of the storm was 40 miles offshore and moving north 12 miles per hour with sustained winds swirling at 135 miles per hour, putting the storm in Category 4 of the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane damage potential. The eye of the storm had nearly reached the coast at 1 a.m. For this storm in this region of bayous and shallow bays, Mr. Mayfield said, the tidal surge, which could be up to 16 feet above sea level in some places, could be the most destructive force. ''I just pray people heeded the advice of local officials and got out,'' he said. Forecasters said the storm would be slow to abate even as it moved inland. And they predicted that it would stall near the southern Appalachians and would slowly dissipate in that area. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida declared states of emergency. Curfews were ordered in several cities, including New Orleans and Mobile County, both to discourage looting and to reduce the danger from falling power lines, trees and other hazards. The first American deaths reported from the hurricane came Wednesday afternoon on the Florida Panhandle when five tornadoes produced by a pinwheeling arm of the hurricane demolished homes and businesses and killed two people, bringing the death toll to 70. Several of the twisters came ashore as towering waterspouts, said Ruth Sasser, a spokeswoman for the Bay County Sheriff's Department. One person died in Panama City Beach and another in a rural area called Allenton. At the Mobile County emergency operations center, a bunker near a water tower on the only hill for miles around, Mayor Michael C. Dow of Mobile said the city had had a long lucky streak, recalling how Hurricane Opal did a last-minute stutter-step in 1995 that took it to the east. But luck had run out, Mr. Dow said. ''We're not going to dodge this one,'' he said. ''I woke up this morning praying it had turned, but it was still there, like a bloodhound.'' Blackouts spread along the coast during the night as power lines fell and transformers sparked and popped, endangering anyone who violated the curfews issued as the storm intensified. In Mobile, police and fire patrols ceased as winds topped 55 m.p.h., and officials and first responders retreated to safety along with the rest of the community. They planned to wait until dawn to look for anyone in danger, said Stephen Nodine, the commissioner for the county district that includes most of the city of Mobile. ''This is the time we just hunker down and pray for the best,'' Mr. Nodine said. In New Orleans, by midafternoon the northeast wind was driving three-foot waves toward the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, where they splashed toward the levee, part of which is set back from the lake. Cupped below sea level in a bowl between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, the city is prone to flooding in ordinary storms, and is perennially threatened with a catastrophic deluge if a storm like Hurricane Ivan were to hit head on and breech the levees. By late Wednesday night it appeared that the city would be spared the worst. On the lawn of the University of New Orleans, the water was already deep enough for two ducks to paddle around under the trees. Tens of thousands of city residents had declined, or could not afford, to evacuate. Mayor C. Ray Nagin turned the Superdome football stadium into a storm shelter, first for those with special needs, like the elderly, and by late afternoon, for all who thought they could be imperiled by flooding. Wednesday night, 1,200 people were sheltered there. ''I think it's safe to say we will have flooding in this city,'' Mr. Nagin said. He also imposed a 2 p.m. curfew that was conspicuously ignored at several bars in the French Quarter. There was no revelry at all 70 miles to the east in Gulfport, Miss., where a grim police chief, Steve Barnes, said: ''I've been through one of these. I would never try to get close to another, but if it comes, I'll make sure we're ready.'' Chief Barnes said he was pleasantly surprised by Gulfport residents' willingness to evacuate. All the businesses in Gulfport between the beach and Interstate 10 were closed, including at least two tall beachfront casinos. To the east, Pensacola, Fla., took a hard hit from the storm's right side, where counterclockwise winds and the storm's own 12-m.p.h. speed added to its potency. Hurricane Ivan is the third potent hurricane to strike the United States in 32 days, and Tropical Storm Jeanne, skirting Puerto Rico, was intensifying toward hurricane strength, forecasters said. Scientists say the Atlantic has settled into a pattern of temperatures and air patterns that is likely to sustain hyperactive hurricane seasons for a decade or two. The Alabama coast has seen extensive development since the last direct hit by a major storm, Hurricane Frederic, almost exactly 25 years ago, and local elected officials braced for the first significant test of hundreds of new structures. Many coastal towns west and east of Mobile Bay were largely emptied by dusk, but some stragglers, particularly longtime residents, refused to budge, said Mike Dean, a commissioner whose district includes the bayous where the shrimping scenes of ''Forrest Gump'' were filmed. Wednesday night, many of the shrimpers who would normally be at sea were huddled in hallways of nine public schools in the area, along with a polyglot assemblage of 7,122 Alabamans including elder-care workers, shipbuilders and farmers. About eight longtime residents refused to leave Dauphin Island, a slender barrier island at the head of Mobile Bay linked to the mainland by a causeway. Those who stayed were asked to sign a form saying they had been warned and to provide the names of next of kin, said Paulette W. Williams, the Mobile County emergency services director. The causeway linking the island to the mainland had been destroyed by Hurricane Frederic. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had recommended at the time that it not be rebuilt because it would encourage too much development. But it was rebuilt, and the island now is densely built. In dozens of coastal cities and towns from Louisiana through the Florida Panhandle, tens of thousand of residents fled inland or moved to shelters and listened to broadcasts of the storm's progress. As hurricane winds picked up on the Alabama coast, residents of the towns bearing first brunt of the storm made their final preparations. ''May God be with us on this journey,'' said Connie Brooks, a school bus driver preparing to lead the last evacuation convoy from Foley High School out of Baldwin County, east of Mobile, in the morning. ''It time for us to go.'' Baldwin County officials had to export their evacuees after they discovered their shelters did not have roofs strong enough to withstand such a powerful storm. Red Cross shelters across Mobile County filled up early. One of the first to reach capacity was at Theodore High School, south of Mobile, which housed 1,100 people by 9 a.m. ''Fear is what brought them here so early,'' said Joyce Kyles, the shelter manager. Every nook of the sprawling school seemed jammed with families. Narrow hallways were lined with bedrolls and air mattresses. Families played cards in alcoves outside locker rooms. The gymnasium was crowded with hundreds of people who blocked off territory with coolers, television sets and folding chairs. Twenty minutes before the cafeteria doors had even opened, 150 people were lined up for dinner. All told, Red Cross officials said that more than 35,000 people were being housed in 62 shelters across Alabama by Wednesday afternoon. By late afternoon, oak-draped downtown streets in Mobile were empty of nearly. Radio stations playing gospel and rock all were attuned to the impending tempest and alternating between streams of alerts and attempts at humor. Reflecting the combination of rural and urban influences in the state, one announcer suggested that horse owners write their names and phone numbers on their animals' hooves with nail polish, so they could be retrieved if they bolt. On a local rock station, in contrast, one could hear the stormy lyrics of the AC/DC hit ''Hell's Bells'': ''I'm a rolling thunder, a pouring rain, I'm comin' on like a hurricane. My lightning's flashing across the sky. You're only young but you're gonna die.'' HURRICANE IVAN: THE OVERVIEW"
"Choosing the animals to leave behind is the hardest part about evacuating a zoo. ''Each time I think about locking that gate this morning, it makes me cry,'' the director of the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo, Patti Hall, said. ''I don't know if the animals we left behind will survive and I don't even know if the zoo will be there at all.'' More than 250 animals from the 15-year-old zoo were removed Wednesday from Gulf Shore. Despite all the efforts, which included using 12 sport utility vehicles, a borrowed repair truck, two 18-wheelers and a livestock trailer, 30 animals remained behind as the police barred access to the low-lying island. The animals left include waterfowl, 3 emus and all the zoo's reptiles, including 8 Burmese pythons, an anaconda and more than 12 Colombian red-tail boas. ''They are in the strongest buildings we have at the zoo,'' Ms. Hall said. ''So there should be no danger at all to the public. I'm not saying a flood couldn't wash the buildings away. But they are nearly bunkers.'' The removed animals are in a makeshift zoo on wheels, with monkeys filling the repair truck and cages of carnivores the 18-wheeler, a few miles inland from the zoo and well within the mandatory evacuation area. ''I sometimes think Noah had it easy compared to this,'' Ms. Hall said as she walked down the row of vehicles parked parallel to the gusting winds. ''We have not slept more than three hours for four days to do this move.'' The lone casualty so far has been Ms. Hall's left index finger, which Kunda, a Capuchin monkey, bit. The kitchen in a house near the vehicles is an overflow room for extra monkeys, and two 4-month-old tiger cubs, Rajah and Rani, roam around an indoor swimming pool. The evacuation began with moving out the yaks, continued with tranquilizing the eight large cats and finished with caging the birds. ''Frightened bird calls panic the other animals,'' Ms. Hall said. ''So you do them last. It is really hard for all the animals to leave the zoo, because it is the only world they know.'' Though the final parts of the move were carried out in haste under high winds, Ms. Hall said, it had been carefully prepared. Each animal has individually prepared containers of food for up to six days, and one of the 10 keepers will be with the animals 24 hours a day. To guard against an escape, a staff member will point a loaded pistol into the carnivore trailer each time the door is opened. ''You cannot tranquilize a lion once it gets too excited,'' Ms. Hall said. ''You have to kill it.'' HURRICANE IVAN: THE ZOO ANIMALS"
"Some hurricanes just won't quit, and American shores yesterday were in the crosshairs of two such long-lived, meandering tempests. The storm once called Hurricane Ivan, which was thought to have spent itself in torrents of earth-rending rain over Appalachia last weekend after bringing destruction to the Alabama-Florida border, was split in two after colliding with high pressure over the East Coast. The storm is blamed for at least 60 deaths in the United States and 70 in the Caribbean. Its obituary had already been written late on Sept. 16 by federal meteorologists, who issued a report concluding: ''This is the last forecast/advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on this system.'' But in such a memorable hurricane season, such finality was bound to be ill advised. Part of the disintegrating storm spun south, drenched eastern Florida with heavy rain on Tuesday, and then crossed that storm-shredded state. It could then draw on the warm, storm-nourishing waters of the Gulf of Mexico and so was reborn. There was some debate at first on Wednesday night, but forecasters at the National Hurricane Center agreed it should retain its name. Breaking from its usual deadpan tones, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued an update saying: ''It sounds like the sequel to a very bad horror movie, but it's no joke. Ivan is back.'' Yesterday the reborn storm blew into the Gulf Coast, lashing Louisiana with thunderstorms and 60-mile-per-hour winds. It was expected to linger over Houston and southeastern Texas through the weekend, carrying the threat of flooding. It is rare, but not unheard of, for storms to revive after nearly dying, said Dan Brown, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It is also not uncommon for a hurricane to take extraordinarily circuitous routes in the Atlantic, Mr. Brown and other forecasters said. A case in point is Hurricane Jeanne. After killing more than 1,000 people in Haiti, mainly in flooding, this storm seemed headed for empty Atlantic waters on Monday. But, like a pinball hitting a bumper, it ran into a ridge of high atmospheric pressure and turned in a complete circle, taking aim once again at the Bahamas and East Coast. Dr. Kerry A. Emanuel, a hurricane expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said storms behaved erratically when the atmosphere was not forcing them to move much in one direction or another. ''It's not really unusual,'' Dr. Emanuel said. ''When it happens near land, as in the case of Hurricane Elena of 1985 in the Gulf of Mexico, it is a nightmare for forecasters.'' For the moment, Hurricane Jeanne appears to be on rails leading directly to northeastern Florida, said Mr. Brown, holding the prospect of a fourth powerful hurricane strike in a year on that state. The storm is likely to draw strength from the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and face no big hurdles in the atmosphere, Mr. Brown said, giving it a decent chance of striking as a Category 2 or even Category 3 storm on the five-step intensity scale. If Hurricane Jeanne stays on track, and almost every model puts it plowing into Florida this weekend before veering north, 2004 will be the first year on record that the state has been struck by four hurricanes, said Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane Center."
"WITH mounting anxiety, Darren Robertshaw watched television reports on Aug. 13 as Hurricane Charley began to wobble and then suddenly veer off its forecast course, to aim its fury at Florida's southwestern coast -- where the hotel he operates was full of guests. ''We really thought it was going to hit Tampa; by the time it took a right turn, our guests had nowhere to go,'' he said recently, remembering how the hurricane surprised his staff and spooked guests at the Trianon Bonita Bay Hotel, in Bonita Springs. As the wind outside screeched at about 70 miles per hour, Mr. Robertshaw tried to reassure everyone. When the power failed, he moved floor lamps from rooms into the stairwells, using generators to light them and to keep the bar open and its fans running. ''We told them, 'It will be uncomfortable -- you will be safe.''' The hotel was only minimally damaged, as the storm only brushed Bonita Springs, but the next day, with still electricity still out, he sent all his guests 18 miles south to a sister hotel in Naples whose 59 rooms were empty because it had been evacuated before the storm. But it did have power. Then, in Naples, he faced yet another hotelier's nightmare: ''We were going from zero rooms'' speaking of the occupation rate, ''to 'sold out' in one day.'' When power at the empty Bonita Springs hotel came back on, it too went in a single day from 100 vacant, dirty rooms -- most had housed six or seven people each the night of the storm -- to 100 occupied, clean ones, as people left homeless by the storm and emergency workers arriving to help the cleanup scrambled for shelter. ''We took 100 reservations just like that, and we could have taken 1,000; there was too much demand,'' said Mr. Robertshaw, vice president of the two Trianon Hotels. ''Most of the other hotels were closed.'' At least Mr. Robertshaw's hotels still stood. Some hotel managers awoke to such extensive damage that it will be weeks or months of construction or repairs before they will be able to accept guests at all. Two weeks after the storm, emergency officials were still limiting entry across the causeway to the barrier islands of Sanibel and Captiva to residents, business owners and construction workers. Parts of the vulnerable barrier islands west of Fort Myers, near the storm's ground zero, still lacked electricity, and some residents were still boiling drinking water because adjacent water pipes were being repaired. Still, rebuilding has begun swiftly and in earnest, and tourism officials are hoping for a quick recovery. Because of the storm's weird path, even in some of the most devastated areas, great swaths escaped unharmed. For instance, while Charley raked the southeastern section of Charlotte County, it left the other side -- the beach community of Englewood, along with Placida, Cape Haze and Palm Island -- untouched, according to Becky Bovell, director of tourism for Charlotte County. ''We're on Captiva, so we're still waiting for power,'' said Jimmy Jensen nearly two weeks after the storm hit the family-owned Jensen's Twin Palms Resort and Marina. The resort is near where the eye wall of Charley, rated Category 4, made landfall, with sustained winds of 145 to 150 m.p.h. and higher gusts, according to Dr. Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The Twin Palms lost part of a roof, its dock and most of its trees and shrubbery, with damage amounting to $200,000 to $250,000, Mr. Jensen said. Meristar Hospitality Corporation, based in Arlington, Va., which owns five properties on Sanibel and the 570-room South Seas Resort on Captiva, expects damages in the millions of dollars, according to its chairman and chief executive, Paul W. Whetsell. ''We're doing as much as we can,'' Mr. Whetsell said. ''We took a pretty good hit on Captiva, not as bad on Sanibel.'' Because some hotels fared better than others, they will reopen over time, somewhere between Labor Day and December, the beginning of the winter season, he said. Even without power, workers on Captiva had already begun repairs two weeks after the storm, using emergency generators. The Collier Inn, on Useppa Island, between Sanibel and Boca Grande, was famous as a home to Barron G. Collier (1873-1939) and lately an elegant bed-and-breakfast accessible only by boat. During the hurricane, gusts that reached an estimated 174 m.p.h. damaged the Collier Inn's roof. One huge chimney collapsed onto a tennis court and another caved through the roof into the interior, according to Vincent Formosa, president of the Useppa Island Club, which owns the inn. He said that repairs may cost $1 million and that the inn may open at least partly by New Year's. The owners of the Best Western Waterfront, overlooking Charlotte Harbor in Punta Gorda, where the storm inflicted a terrible blasting, were still trying to decide late last month whether to renovate or rebuild, according to Best Western International, based in Phoenix. Www.bestwestern.com is testament to Charley's power: On Aug. 30 a link called Hurricane Charley Alert listed 10 damaged Best Western hotels, 174 miles apart, from Arcadia in southwest Florida, all the way to Ormond Beach in the state's northeastern sector. Three -- in Kissimmee, Winter Haven and Ormond Beach -- were already open with ''limited inventory.'' One, in Fort Myers, will not reopen until Jan. 1, according to the site. Still, there were bright spots. In Naples as the hurricane approached, Maas Vandentop, the owner of the Inn by the Sea bed-and-breakfast, moved valuables to the second floor and evacuated the inn, six rooms and a cottage set two blocks from what had become a ferocious Gulf of Mexico. Though forecasters predicted severe flooding, it didn't happen, as Charley swerved away. ''An enormous mahogany tree right next to our building, 15 inches in diameter, broke like matches, and fell alongside,'' he said. ''We were very, very lucky.'' Two days later, the inn reopened. In Orlando, airport officials clocked winds of 104 m.p.h., yet the city's theme parks reported only minor damage. Many closed Friday afternoon, Aug. 13, but all had reopened two days later. ''We had thousands of guests that stayed in our hotels the night of the hurricane,'' said Veronica Clemons, spokeswoman for Walt Disney World Company, of Lake Buena Vista. ''The only resort we closed was Fort Wilderness Resort Campground.'' Those guests were moved to indoor rooms in a different Disney property. ''It wasn't safe to be out at a campsite.'' And in Daytona Beach, where Charley left Florida, officials reported only minor damage. ''We're up and ready for a big Labor Day weekend,'' said Sharon Mock, director of the Daytona Beach Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''The beaches are open, the hotels are open, we're ready to roll.'' Even amid the worst destruction, tourism officials found room for optimism. ''We are a nature-based destination, we are a boating and fishing capital of the world,'' said Ms. Bovell, the Charlotte County tourism director. ''All of those things are intact. We have some cleaning up to do -- tourism infrastructure, that sort of thing -- but our destination is just as it was. ''We're very determined,'' she continued. ''We come back stronger and healthier in the end. Like the phoenix, we will rise again. What we're saying to our customers is: 'We're coming back in a big way, and we hope you will, too.''' The Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1 and ends Nov. 30, according to the National Hurricane Center. SARA KENNEDY is a writer who lives in Tampa, Fla."
"Battered on the west three weeks ago by Hurricane Charley and being battered this weekend on the east by Hurricane Frances, Florida is a victim of a climate currently favorable for hurricanes and of simple bad luck. In 1995, after three relatively unstormy decades, a naturally occurring oscillation in the Atlantic Ocean started a new active era for hurricanes. ''The number of major hurricanes went up by a factor of two and a half,'' said Stanley B. Goldenberg, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane research division in Miami. ''You have a lot of arrows, and you have a lot of targets.'' Some hurricane targets like the Caribbean have been hit several times since then. ''They've been pounded,'' Mr. Goldenberg said. ''They know we've had an increase.'' Mr. Goldenberg and other hurricane experts said Florida and other parts of the United States were fortunate that more disastrous storms had not struck in recent years. Of the 35 major hurricanes -- Category 3 or stronger, with sustained winds of more than 111 miles per hour -- that have formed in the Atlantic since August 1995, only four, or less than one in eight, have hit the United States as major hurricanes. Historically, the odds have been one in three. That means most of Florida has been unscathed since the 1960's, when the last active era of hurricanes ended. In the 38 years from 1966 through 2003, only one major hurricane, Andrew in 1992, struck southern Florida. In the preceding active period, the 40 years from 1926 to 1965, the region was hit 14 times. ''I view this year as very unlucky for Florida,'' said Dr. William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University who forecasts the hurricane season, ''but this is within the natural variation of storms.'' Each year, between August and November, about 60 low-pressure systems form off the western coast of Africa and waft westward. Warm waters and favorable winds turn some of them into tropical storms; others dissipate and disappear. Tropical storms acquire names when sustained winds exceed 39 miles per hour; hurricanes are Atlantic tropical storms with winds of at least 74 miles per hour. An average hurricane season has 9.6 named storms, of which 5.9 become hurricanes and 2.3 of them turn into major hurricanes. But this year, eight named storms formed during August alone -- a record. On Friday, he increased his forecast for this year's season to 16 named tropical storms (up from 13), 8 hurricanes (up from 7) and 5 major hurricanes (up from 3). He predicts that September will remain active, but that hurricane activity will tail off in October, because of warm water in the central tropical Pacific, possibly the beginnings of an El Niño climate pattern, which tends to suppress storms in the Atlantic. Dr. Gray, Mr. Goldenberg and other scientists reported in 2001 that the severity of a hurricane season correlated strongly with a decades-long cycle of ocean temperatures in the Atlantic. When waters in the North Atlantic are cooler, wind shear, which tears storms apart, is stronger, suppressing hurricanes. Global warming is not a significant factor in this year's storminess, experts said. While some climate models predict that warming might eventually mean somewhat stronger hurricanes, that effect is expected to be very small compared to the natural hurricane cycle. Where a hurricane goes depends on the surrounding meteorological conditions. As they spin like tops across the Atlantic, some barrel straight west, into Central America or Mexico. Others, after passing a semipermanent high-pressure system that sits over Bermuda in the summer, take a sharp right to the north, missing land entirely. And some veer into the United States. Although the number of hurricanes has been up for years, most have either headed straight west, like Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed 10,000 people in Honduras and Nicaragua, or turned north, harmlessly. When Hurricane Charley formed in August, the high-altitude winds known as the jet stream, which usually blow near the American-Canadian border, had dipped much farther south. That created a low-pressure system over the western Gulf of Mexico, so Hurricane Charley, instead of continuing westward, was steered to the northeast, into Florida. This time, with Hurricane Frances, the Bermuda high has stretched westward for most of the past week almost to Tennessee. That prevented the storm from turning northward. Because the active hurricane pattern for the Atlantic will most likely continue for decades longer, Mr. Goldenberg said disaster planners need to prepare for years like 2004. ''This is not just a spike,'' Mr. Goldenberg said. ''This is a taste of what we still have to come.'' HURRICANE FRANCES: METEOROLOGY"
"Battering wind and record-setting rain from Tropical Storm Gaston caused at least five deaths as a deluge washed away roads, flooded houses and businesses, and sent vehicles floating down the streets of Richmond. Five people were confirmed dead by late Tuesday, and several others were reported missing. On Monday afternoon, rushing waters replaced rush-hour traffic in downtown Richmond, where a flood wall, built in 1995 to contain the James River in such storms, stood with its gates left open, because powerful rains had outstripped the river's rise and raced downhill. At the bottom of historic Church Hill, cars floated past the Farmer's Market as swiftly and easily as the boats that plied the river 200 years ago. Swift-water rescue teams took stranded drivers and their passengers to safety as the waters rose on both sides of the James. On Tuesday, Gov. Mark Warner visited the Shockoe Bottom district, where floodwater reached 9 to 10 feet a few blocks downhill from the state's Capitol and the Executive Mansion. In some places, cars had come to rest atop one another; others clustered against buildings or light poles. Governor Warner told a group of Shockoe Bottom business owners that small-business low-interest loans would be available. ''For those who live and work here,'' he said, ''we're going to be with you to try to help you rebuild.'' As another major storm, Hurricane Frances, makes its way north, the state faces the possibility of more devastation later this week. Governor Warner said he was keeping an eye on the hurricane. ''I just checked, and it looks like it might be veering a little off course,'' he said. ''But in light of Isabel a year ago and Gaston this week, we're going to err on the side of extra preparedness.'' Around 8 p.m. on Monday, after five hours of high wind, heavy rain and multiple tornado warnings for the area, the governor declared a state of emergency for affected areas across Central Virginia. About 1,000 people were forced from homes in Richmond, where the storm's effects were felt hardest. The strip of I-95 that runs through the heart of Richmond was closed Monday night as driving rain, strong wind gusts and flash floods caused at least 20 accidents. By Tuesday morning, 18 primary and 161 secondary roads in Central Virginia were closed, flooded or completely washed out by Tropical Storm Gaston, which weakened to a tropical depression before it trundled through Richmond, bringing 14 inches of rain in eight hours in some areas. The storm came ashore on Sunday in South Carolina. Between 5 and 9 p.m. Monday, the storm circled the Richmond area, with pounding rain and whipping wind coming in surges that lasted from minutes to an hour or more. The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings, sometimes with only minutes between the end of one warning and the beginning of the next. The service confirmed that two tornadoes touched down in Nottoway and James City Counties."
"The rains and the winds were expected, as were the power failures and the flooding. But what nobody expected was that Hurricane Ivan would move a mountain. But that is almost what the remnants of the storm did Thursday night, setting off a two-mile-long mudslide in the Peeks Creek area of Franklin that left at least three people dead, more than a dozen homes destroyed and this close-knit North Carolina community devastated. On Sunday, for the first time since the storm hit, residents who had barely escaped with their lives were allowed to return to where their homes used to stand. Under clear blue skies, many spent the day rummaging for memories in the debris, even as teams of rescue workers continued to search in the hopes of finding four people who remained missing. Peeks Creek is a community of 30 to 40 homes about 55 miles southwest of Asheville. The name refers to the mountain stream that runs down Fish Hawk Mountain, part of the Blue Ridge mountain chain in the southwestern part of the state. Robert Crisp, 55, has lived in the area all of his life. He said that in normal times, the creek is no more that 10 feet wide. Now a gash has been ripped along the side of the mountain, 50 yards across in some places. Mr. Crisp, whose mother and sister narrowly avoided being caught in the slide, said it was amazing more people did not die. ''Some of them were real lucky,'' he said. It was only when the sun came up Friday morning that the true scale of the devastation became clear. There is a brown, barren spot at the top of the mountain, striking because it is surrounded by lush greenery. Like in a tornado, only things in the mudslide's path were destroyed, while homes and gardens feet away were left untouched. Along the 3,000-foot path that the mudslide cut, brick homes where lifted from their foundations and transplanted yards away; scores of oak, pine and poplar trees that lined the creek were ripped up by the roots and scattered like toothpicks; cars were tossed like toys, with one Mercedes-Benz ending up in a tree. Amid the destruction, unexplainable odds and ends were left intact. A bed that crashed through the wall of a house was all made up and looked ready for someone to retire for the night. Glass wind chimes were still hanging from a porch on a house that had moved far from where it once stood. Two adults and a child were confirmed dead. A woman 28 weeks pregnant suffered a miscarriage, officials said. President Bush declared western North Carolina a federal disaster area, making assistance available to individuals and the community. Residents who returned to survey the damage on Sunday mingled with the authorities, many who had spent the last three days combing the area. A geologist was brought in to try to explain why the slide occurred, but there was no immediate answer other than the fact that rains played an integral role. Across North Carolina, the rains caused heavy damage, washing away part of Interstate 40, knocking out power for tens of thousands and leading to the deaths of at least eight people in all. Specially trained search dogs moved nimbly on the spots where homes once stood, as swift-water teams tied themselves to the riverbanks and waded into the muddy water, still well above the normal level. Scores of others, including firefighters, police officers and volunteers, combed the area on foot. Larry Dills sat on an uprooted tree overlooking the scene. The dogs were searching for one of his relatives. Mr. Dills had already lost a cousin in the slide and now they were searching for another. ''It's unbelievable,'' he said. The police asked reporters to withhold the names of the victims until their families could be notified and the community could come to grips with the storm's impact. In fact, with electricity out in 14,000 homes in the area, many people were still unsure of what exactly happened. Warren Cabe, director of emergency management in Macon County, home to Peeks Creek, said workers were still searching for four people. They hoped that two of them might not have been at the scene of the destruction and would be found alive. ''We are slowly making progress out of the situation we are in,'' Mr. Cabe said. The local authorities have been joined by teams from neighboring counties and states as well from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Part of the reason at least half a dozen people made it to safety was the quick work of the Cullasaja Gorge Fire Department, near Peeks Creek. The fire chief, Johnny Teem, said he reached the area only minutes after the slide ended, between 10 and 11 p.m. Thursday. In the darkness, it was hard to know what was happening, Chief Teem said. People living in the area likened the noise of the slide to that of a dozen locomotives barreling down a track. ''It was terrifying,'' he said. ''It was just a wall of big trees and water.'' Firefighters were quickly dispatched to either side of the slide and began searching for survivors. ''Our radios were going out, our flashlights were growing dim,'' Chief Teem said. They quickly found a boy with a broken ankle writhing in pain and brought him out through the woods. Farther up they found an elderly woman who needed oxygen, which they got to her, Chief Teem said. One couple told him about being inside their house when it moved 50 feet. They were unharmed. As the firefighters made their way in the mud and darkness, they found a man with his leg broken. ''It was such a terrible thing,'' Chief Teem said. One woman was trapped in such a way that it took firefighters until morning, eight hours after she was found, to get her out. She is in critical condition, law enforcement officials said. National Guard helicopters circled the mountaintop on Sunday, helping the searchers on the ground and photographing the destruction. Local church groups also volunteered to bring food and supplies to residents whose homes were not destroyed but who are now cut off from water and electricity. The main road serving Peeks Creek is still largely destroyed or covered by debris, but some four-wheel-drive vehicles are able to get through. There are also those coming who are not helpful, the Macon County sheriff, Robert L. Holland, said. ''We are having a real security issue with people up there coming in,'' Sheriff Holland said. Many, he said, seem to be curious and want to take a souvenir or just look. Even as the sheriff helped direct rescue efforts, he worried about members of his own family who live in the area. He said it was not until hours after the slide that he found out they were unharmed."
"Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes along the Delaware River on Sunday, after heavy rains Saturday from the remnants of Hurricane Ivan caused the river to swell to its highest level in decades. The river spilled over its banks along an 80-mile stretch from Easton, Pa., as far south as Trenton, forcing the authorities to close several bridges, shut down flooded roadways and evacuate homes. There were no deaths or serious injuries reported, but one house in Phillipsburg, N.J., was uprooted by the waters and carried downriver several hundreds yards before hitting a bridge. Although the waters were expected to crest by 10 p.m. Sunday, a flood warning was to remain in effect until at least Monday morning, said Sgt. Kevin Rehmann, a spokesman for the New Jersey state police. In Trenton, where the waters reached nearly 25 feet above flood level, about 1,000 people left their homes, stretches of Route 29 were submerged and state workers filled sandbags to protect office buildings near the river. About 75 people spent Saturday night or part of Sunday at an emergency shelter in the Joseph Stokes Memorial School, including about a dozen residents from the Water's Edge home for the elderly in South Trenton, which was evacuated Saturday afternoon. Mercer County's sheriff, Kevin Larkin, said that some residents may not be able to return to their homes until Tuesday. ''We're just telling them, we are going to protect your residences and if you can just put up with a little discomfort for a couple of days, we'll get you back to normal,'' the sheriff said. Across the river, in Bucks County, Pa., more than 1,600 people were evacuated, according to Ann Machesic, a county spokeswoman. Some of the most severe flooding occurred in Yardley, where sections of the town's tiny downtown were closed and some homes and businesses near the river were reportedly knee-deep in water. The flooding came a day after torrential rain pounded sections of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and upstate New York, leaving five inches of rain in some communities. On Saturday, Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey declared a state of emergency for Mercer, Hunterdon, Sussex and Warren Counties, and by early Sunday, emergency service officials were beginning to evacuate some neighborhoods near the river's edge. Joseph Quick, 76, said he was resting in his room at the River's Edge home on Saturday when teams of emergency workers and staff members led him and other residents out of the building. ''I'd like to go back,'' said Mr. Quick, as he pushed his walker in the emergency shelter. ''They pulled me out of my bed.'' A meteorologist from the National Weather Service, Joe Miketta, said the flooding was more severe than it was during the last major flood on the Delaware, in 1996. Saturday's rains were caused by the remains of Hurricane Ivan, which killed 70 people in the Caribbean and another 43 along the Gulf Coast of the United States. In some parts of New Jersey, the rain fell at one and a half inches per hour, Mr. Miketta said, and when the runoff reached the Delaware, the sheer volume of water caused the river to spill over its banks. By late Sunday morning, the rushing water had risen to within three feet of the deck of the bridge between Lambertville, N.J., and New Hope, Pa., raising concerns that the structure could be damaged or washed out. By early evening however, the water level began to drop, and local officials said they believed that the worst danger had passed. ''We're feeling pretty confident that we are going to be O.K.,'' said Lambertville's police director, Bruce Cocuzza. Despite the warnings issued late Saturday, some residents were still surprised by the flooding Sunday because the heaviest rains fell in communities far from the river. Sue Holzmer, of Titusville, N.J., said she was just beginning her honeymoon in Cape May when she got a call Sunday morning that helicopters were over her house and the river was flooding. She returned home to find two feet of water in the basement. ''It never ceases to amaze me, the power of this river,'' Ms. Holzmer said. In many communities along the river, the Delaware was watched more in awe than in fear. With Sunday's mild temperatures and brilliant sunshine, families walked to watch ducks and geese paddling down flooded streets or marvel at the rushing river, which carried fallen trees, barrels and overturned boats. At Washington Crossing State Park, hundreds of sightseers were snapping pictures of the rising river as it raced under the Washington Crossing Bridge. Just north of the state park, most of the homeowners in the Titusville area were keeping close watch of the rising tide and waiting it out. Only five homes were evacuated in that waterfront community. ''I don't think it's going to hit the deck,'' said one resident, Jim Trainor, sticking a tape measure into the river and noting about 10 inches of leeway between the river and his deck patio. ''If necessary, I could be out of here in 10 seconds.''"
"Hurricanes are mostly perceived as coastal disasters, and rightly so given the impact their surging waters and blasting winds can have. To get the idea, one need only have seen the Heritage, a 30-foot powerboat, when it ended up parked perfectly at a Bay Bank drive-up cash machine on Dauphin Island, Ala., after Hurricane Ivan swept ashore in darkness Thursday morning. Indeed, on that island, pounded by a similar hurricane 25 years earlier and developed now more heavily than ever, every boat in sight was either under the water or perched on dry land. But away from the ocean, here in the pine and pulp country of the Florida Panhandle's interior, where International Paper tends an endless pointillist landscape of fast-growing trees, the imprint of Hurricane Ivan not only was visible on Friday but also hung pungently in the air. The tarry scent of fresh sap rose from a green carpet of crushed needles and boughs that covered rural roadways. The smell also came from the shattered trunks of the once-tall pines that lined the routes. Here and there, in clusters that reflected where 140-mile-an-hour gusts had punched the woods, the trees had fallen across the roads and were only slowly being cut away. Traffic was flowing along rural wooded routes, because the hurricane's winds and tidal surge had dismantled sections of the arcing bridges carrying Interstate 10 over the broad twin bays east of Pensacola and had also damaged the next-biggest road, U.S. 90. The convoys moved in opposite directions. Some storm-weary people, without power or a place to buy necessities, were heading out of stricken counties even as fleets of utility trucks and water and gasoline tankers headed in for the rebuilding process. Passing near this town, the travelers got a souvenir for their efforts: a sticky coating of resin built on fenders and rear windows, carrying the perfume of a natural disaster with it. In places, lines of vehicles pulsed through the lightless countryside, like an inching glowworm stretching for miles, long after midnight Friday morning. But it was a patient organism, and amazingly polite. As cars crept along roads with no traffic signals (and none likely for days to come), drivers, without any prodding by the police or other officialdom, settled into an informal etiquette. With hardly a honk, they treated every intersection for miles around, whether on a fast four-lane highway or on a rural lane, as if it had four-way stop signs. There were other reasons to drive slowly, of course. In Cantonment and dozens of other communities large and small, an unlit traffic signal or a power line dangled here and there at windshield height. Ho-Hum Hurricanes In places across this summer's storm zone were signs that some residents had begun starting to incorporate the prospect of such catastrophes into their lives instead of seeing them as improbably rare events. Hurricanes were becoming normal. Among the 2,000-odd storm evacuees camped in a maze of hallways at Baker High School in Mobile, Ala., a cluster of Cambodian-American shrimp-fishing families from the nearby town of Bayou La Batre had settled in quite comfortably, with three rice steamers plugged into outlets and large stores of dried delicacies. No signs of hasty packing there. Bruce Khat, a relative newcomer to the community, said he had quickly been coached on the storm drill by the veterans. ''They told me just what to expect,'' he said. The Crippled Command Post Plenty of kinks remained, however. The Mobile County Emergency Operations Center, partly occupying a concrete bunker built during the cold war to survive nuclear attack, ran smoothly for a while. The only problem there, it seemed, was that during the roaring maelstrom outside, smokers had no place to feed their habit. But just as county officials and utility representatives were plotting on Thursday how to restore power to 200,000 residents, the windowless bunker's own lights went out. There was apparently water in the generator fuel. Weary Weatherman Even meteorologists, whose lives revolve around such swirling storms, were showing signs of strain after three destructive hurricane landfalls on American shores in little more than a month, with more in the offing. Ryan Towell, a forecaster for WeatherBug.com, a commercial source for forecasts and the like, had spent the night of Hurricane Ivan's arrival at the bunker in Mobile, updating a blog on WeatherBug's Web site and sleeping in snippets on the hard, cold floor. The 32-year-old Mr. Towell, from Gaithersburg, Md., had earlier traveled to Florida to greet Hurricanes Charley and Frances, and was now running out of energy. ''The first one was exciting and a little scary,'' he said. ''But the third one was 'All right, already.' And the possibility of a fourth? I don't even want to think about that.'' Reporter's Notebook"
"Bob Ellis was picking up plywood and two-by-fours on his second trip of the day for supplies to deal with the wreckage from Hurricane Frances, the second of three hurricanes that have hit Florida and the southeastern United States in the last five weeks. Mr. Ellis, a carpenter, was planning to build sides on two flat-bed trailers so he could make money hauling trees and shrubs ruined in the hurricane nearly two weeks ago. ''We understand FEMA is paying quite well for cleaning up debris,'' he said on Thursday as workers loaded the lumber into his pickup at a Home Depot store here. FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has already promised at least $2 billion in aid to the state and has dispensed over $200 million in cash to hundreds of thousands of victims, along with another $100 million in housing aid. It has become almost as familiar a presence for beleaguered Floridians these days as are presidential campaign commercials. As one hurricane after another has pounded Florida since Aug. 13 -- when Hurricane Charley cut a swath from Fort Myers in the southwest through Orlando in the center of the state -- many businesses have been shut for days and sometimes weeks. That led to a broad economic slowdown in a state that previously had been doing considerably better than much of the rest of the country. But even before a full assessment of the billions of dollars in damage this week from Ivan, which wreaked havoc in the Florida Panhandle and caused major damage along the neighboring coasts of Alabama and Mississippi, the economic situation is already changing here on the ground. Most businesses in the state are up and running again. Indeed, the glimmerings of a miniboom are apparent. Early estimates suggest that total losses from the three storms could reach as high as $45 billion to $50 billion, with as much as $26 billion of that covered by insurance claims. That's not the only monetary impact, of course. Florida's $500 billion economy is the fifth largest in the nation and retailers and manufacturers around the country have felt the ripple effects from the disruption. Wal-Mart, Federated Department Stores and other retailers said earlier this month that sales were running a little behind expectations, in part because of the loss of consumer traffic in Florida. With power off across broad stretches of the state, the storms also cut into the nation's industrial production, causing utility output to fall over 2 percent. And with the first two hurricanes knocking out an estimated 20,000 jobs, the devastation added to the number of people nationwide filing for unemployment claims. While it will take a long time for many of the people who suffered damage to their homes and businesses to recover their losses, an economic bounce-back from the first storms is already under way. Economists expect the Panhandle and the Gulf Coast states to go through a similar experience: a few days or weeks of stagnation, then a surge of new activity that lasts considerably longer. Experts began to study this cyclical effect from modern hurricanes seriously after Hurricane Andrew hit South Florida hard 12 years ago, stunning the state with a loss of over $35 billion, in today's dollars. Based on that pattern, J. Antonio Villamil, the chairman of Gov. Jeb Bush's council of economic advisers, says the recovery in Florida and neighboring states is expected to build sharply over the next few months and may extend for a year or two, propelled by heavy infusions of money from the federal government, insurers and relief agencies. And in part because of the closeness to the presidential election and Florida's role as a critical swing state, experts expect the money from Washington to flow even faster than in a typical disaster. [On Friday, the White House said that President Bush would be flying to the Florida Panhandle on Sunday, his third visit to the state in a month.] ''After most natural disasters it takes some time for the federal government money to start flowing,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com, a research consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. ''But I think this disaster came right to the top of the policy agenda.'' Not everyone, of course, is benefiting from the improving business situation. Restaurants and movie theaters, for example, are still suffering. So are some of the retailers as people have cut back on traditional back-to-school spending on things like clothing and accessories. Many people affected by the hurricanes are conserving their money so they can focus on their immediate needs; others are holding back because they are simply too tired to go out after long days of mopping up and struggling with plugging leaks and replacing siding. ''We're not eating out the way we used to and we're conserving gas,'' said Peter Crafts, who owns a picture framing and art conservation business here in Stuart. Mr. Crafts's shop has been closed for nearly two weeks, but he said he expected to make up for that lost period in the months ahead as people come in with water-damaged paintings to be repaired. The recovery is strongest so far on the southwest coast around Fort Myers and Punta Gorda, where the first hurricane blasted ashore on Aug. 13. It is just gathering momentum at the heart of the destruction that Frances inflicted along the Atlantic Coast over Labor Day weekend. And, of course, it has yet to start in the Panhandle region and along the Gulf. Here in Stuart, where hundreds of roofs were ripped off and forests of trees and shrubs were shredded, building supply stores and construction companies are at the leading edge of an upturn that is also starting to draw in resources from around the country. Out-of-state manufacturers of plywood and electricity generators, for example, have said they are having trouble keeping up with the demand from Florida. Building contractors here are hiring as fast as they can and rushing to sign up customers for repairs before, they fear, battalions of out-of-state carpenters and roofers pour in. ''Right now, the money is in roofing repairs, drywall repairs, fixing interiors and cleaning up debris,'' Mr. Ellis said. After Hurricane Frances, Mr. Ellis quit his job as a supervisor on a project building 20 new homes to work fewer hours but at higher pay for a contractor who decided to specialize in hurricane repair. On Wednesday, Mr. Ellis said, he went out to give an estimate on replacing the roof on a three-bedroom home. He noticed most of the roofs on the street were damaged and returned a little later with a handbill offering repair services. By the end of the day he had 12 new customers. ''Everywhere you look, you can go down any street and I guarantee you 80 percent of the houses are damaged,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''If you get two or three people on every block or so, that's good money. We're not charging any more than usual. It's just the sheer volume. There are definitely not enough workers to cover the damage that's been done.'' But already the laws of supply and demand are altering the labor market in ways that will help speed the recovery. Shortly after Hurricane Charley destroyed hundreds of acres of orange groves in south central Florida, for instance, citrus workers lined up in the town of Wauchula to apply for jobs as roofers. ''You're going to see a lot of this,'' Mr. Villamil said. As power is restored, stores reopen and people go back to work, the initial panic buying of generators and cleaning supplies has been replaced by a steady flow of shoppers seeking materials for repairs, insect repellent and a host of other supplies. ''It's starting,'' said Dan Grund, the manager of the Home Depot in Stuart, about 100 miles north of Miami. ''It'll probably be a little heavier in the next week or so.'' As he spoke, Tyrone Sawyer, a maintenance worker from Indian Town, about 20 miles inland, was paying for four carts full of shingles, tar paper and lumber with a $500 voucher he had received from the Red Cross. Another shopper, Pat Clausing, a real estate agent, said neighbors had told her that she probably would not be able to find any tarpaulins to cover her roof. But she found three, and, she said, there were still a few left on the shelf. As she was leaving the store, her cellphone rang. It was her husband, Tom, at his office in West Palm Beach. ''I got the tarps,'' she said. ''They're not as large as Susan's. But I got 'em.'' For people in the real estate business like Mrs. Clausing, however, it will be a while before the economic resurgence hits home. She had been out of work for nearly two weeks; when she finally made some phone calls on Wednesday she found that four families who had wanted to sell their homes were now wondering if they should wait. ''A lot of people sell here to go to larger or smaller houses or condos,'' she said. ''They scale up or scale down. They want to stay in the area. But the whole area has been hit hard. So they're kind of, 'Let's see what's available before we put ours on the market.''' Denise Rabinowitz lost a week's pay as a clerk for FedEx in Port St. Lucie. Her insurance company was going to be among those contributing to the recovery, paying for a new roof and an air-conditioner crushed by a falling tree. But she was not waiting for the check. She spent $94.98 on Thursday for three shrubbery clippers, half a dozen spray cans of insect repellent and a few other things. Her biggest concern was the bugs. ''Everywhere you go red ants are out,'' she said. ''Lots of wasps, lots of bees. It's just been crazy.''"
"The calm blue skies above this Alabama town on Friday made it seem like any other beach resort on a sunny afternoon. A cursory inspection of the thin strip of land along the Gulf of Mexico, however, quickly revealed the destruction wrought by Hurricane Ivan. The sand was peppered with tire-puncturing debris that included a mushy mixture of building materials and personal belongings. A wooden house twisted on its stilts leaned sideways, while another had lost its roof and perhaps an upper floor. It was hard to tell. A concrete condominium lay crumpled like tissue paper; another leaned precariously toward the water. Long tongues of tile flooring dripped toward the waves from one building, sole remnants of sought-after sea-view rooms that were sheared off by the storm. Of the houses on the upscale gated community of Ono Island that still had roofs, many appeared blinded by the shattering of their large panoramic windows. Although the hurricane has been downgraded to a tropical depression, it continues to churn north, leaving a death toll of 75 in the Caribbean and, The Associated Press said, at least 40 in the United States, and hundreds of thousands without power in Alabama and Florida. The hurricane, which spawned at least 48 tornadoes in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland, set the record of 10 days for the amount of time spent as a major hurricane. Moving through Georgia and the Carolinas, the storm killed 11 people as it tossed trees onto cars, homes and power lines while unleashing mudslides and floods. Most of those deaths occurred in mountainous Appalachia, where strong rains washed flash floods across roads. In White County, Ga., a 6-year-old girl was swept into a culvert from her trailer park by a flooding creek, an emergency management spokeswoman said. Heavy rain stranded about 150 students and employees at an elementary school in southeastern Ohio, The Associated Press reported, although emergency officials said the building was on high ground and out of danger. ''We're probably here for the duration of the night,'' the school librarian, Patti McKibben, told the wire service. ''The Red Cross is bringing in blankets by boat.'' About 100 children in the West Virginia panhandle also were forced to spend the night at their schools because of flooding, The Associated Press said. In Virginia, Gov. Mark R. Warner declared a state of emergency, the wire service reported, and in western North Carolina, the Department of Transportation said nearly 200 roads were impassable, including Interstate 40 west of Asheville. Here in Gulf Shores, armed National Guard personnel turned back all island residents as the authorities waited for the tidal surge to recede enough for damage assessments. Officials in Florida, where the third hurricane in five weeks has left virtually the entire state a federal disaster area, pleaded for extra time before residents come back. ''We're asking people to not return to their homes,'' said Cragin Mosteller, spokeswoman for the Florida Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. ''Today is critical for search and rescue.'' Large swaths in the hurricane's path through Florida and Alabama remained without electricity, with some officials warning that full restoration of power could take weeks. Peter Teahen, a Red Cross spokesman, said Friday that 32,000 people were in Red Cross shelters on Thursday night, down from 40,000 on Wednesday night. Most of those, Mr. Teahen said, were in Florida, where the charity was still providing shelter for 510 evacuees from Hurricane Frances, which struck less than two weeks ago. In Alabama, incidents of looting and price gouging were reported by officials at the Baldwin County emergency management agency, including the arrest of two men found scavenging at a school. Emergency food distribution points were set up by the authorities in Baldwin County, but several restaurants began to reopen, including a Burger King with its front sign gone. ''This is our first meal since eating in a church on Wednesday in Mississippi,'' said Tracy Hubbard, as she waited in line at the Burger King. ''I can't wait to eat something other than a sandwich.'' Some people said they enjoyed aspects of being thrown back to the pre-electricity era. ''I feel like an old-time innkeeper when working by candlelight and using paper,'' said Clennie Thead, duty manager at a Holiday Inn Express near the Alabama shoreline that was booked solid with people weathering the hurricane.Two policemen helped shoppers at a darkened Walgreen's in Pensacola, Fla., fetching items as employees worked the registers. Gasoline became a valued commodity as residents returned with empty tanks from safe havens. ''We prayed over the top of this car and really only got here on fumes,'' said Richard Proctor of Foley, Ala., who had taken refuge in Mobile. A hospital in one of the hardest-hit Alabama counties reported a sharp increase in hurricane-related accidents. ''There was nothing to do during the storm,'' said Dr. John Meade of South Baldwin Regional Medical Center. ''Now things are really starting to get busy.'' Among the more high profile businesses wrecked by the hurricane was Floribama, a vast beachfront complex of bars along the Florida-Alabama state line. ''I can tell you that Floribama is no more,'' said Jim Jeter, who flew an ultralight airplane along the coast on Friday morning. ''I would not call this a cultural disaster because I am sure they will rise again.'' Many who heard news of the devastation returned with relief to find their homes mainly intact. ''I can tell you that I will be thanking the Lord for what happened to our place,'' said Greg Ingle of Foley who had retreated to Birmingham before the storm. ''There's damage on every building around ours, including one that was opened up like a can of sardines.'' Mr. Ingle, who sells spas, said he expects to be out of work for quite some time. ''There's certainly a lot of people who could use a therapeutic spa,'' he said. ''But I don't reckon it's the first thing on anyone's mind right now.'' -------------------- Tropical Storm Jeanne Weakens SAMANA, Dominican Republic, Sept. 17 (AP) -- Tropical Storm Jeanne lashed Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic on Friday before it weakened to a tropical depression and headed toward the Bahamas. Eight were killed across the Caribbean. In Puerto Rico, a severe thunderstorm in the south brought up to two feet of rain and produced lightning and gusty winds that caused the authorities to urge residents to stay inside sturdy buildings. Officials urged residents to boil their water, prompting angry comments because half the four million residents were without running water for a third day and 70 percent had no electricity. Correction: September 22, 2004, Wednesday An article on Saturday about the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan misspelled the name of a beachfront complex of bars along the Florida-Alabama border that was damaged by the storm. It is Flora-Bama, not Floribama."
"The wetlands of southern Florida were formed for, or at least well adapted to, the weather of the hurricane belt. Most of its natural vegetation grows low, except for the oak trees. Its native animals are built low to the ground; alligators hunker down and present their tails to the wind when it gets wild. But as the state's population was climbing to its current 16 million, inland water became something to be moved. Naturally wet land was dried out, largely by a system of canals, levees, pumps and gates. More than 2,000 miles of canals and more than 120 structures keep backyards dry and allow naturally wet counties like Broward to accommodate more than 600 houses per square mile. Now the arrival of two hurricanes in the past month and a third one, Hurricane Ivan, bearing down on Florida, the managers of the state's water control system are increasingly forced to choose between their dual objectives. They want to keep the ecosystem, including the estuaries on both coasts and the Everglades, in as natural a state as possible, and they want to save lives and keep property from flooding. In this heavy hurricane season, accomplishing both objectives is increasingly difficult. Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances have left most of south Florida's water system brimful, and the first priority of the South Florida Water Management District is to minimize flooding in residential areas. So its engineers are furiously pumping millions of gallons of water -- the equivalent of several swimming pools full -- a second through the Caloosahatchee River to the west and a half-dozen canals to the east. The agency has also opened a series of gates that hold water in the upper Everglades, the overfull wetland area dedicated for the use of the Miccosukee tribe of Indians, and allowed it to meander into Everglades National Park. This is something the Miccosukee think is long overdue and park officials reluctantly accept as an emergency effort to avoid urban flooding. ''Hurricanes and the Everglades go hand in hand,'' said David Reiner of the environmental group Friends of the Everglades. ''That's what helped form Florida. That's what sustains it.'' But, Mr. Reiner added, ''people living around it kicks it out of balance.'' The needs of the people, however, are a priority of the water system managers. Given that inherent conflict, biologists said in interviews that this season's hurricanes -- and the effort of agencies to compensate for them -- will help, or hurt, or both, depending on which part of the ecosystem is involved. ''We're trying to mimic natural systems,'' said Dan Kimball, the superintendent of Everglades National Park. ''And you know hurricanes are part of the natural system here.'' Mr. Kimball added, ''They can eliminate a lot, but can spread a lot of seeds at the same time.'' The decades of development that have brought people and their farms and shopping malls to the state provide various cargoes to be carried into the estuaries with the leftover rain. There is agricultural runoff, loaded with nutrients that transform the waters they linger in. There are the seeds of invasive species that take advantage of the storm's disturbance to insinuate themselves into new soil. And there is the urban runoff, with all the associated animal waste and fertilizer and assorted chemicals. ''When a hurricane goes through, an estuary can see raw sewage coming in, and that can change an ecosystem for years,'' said Fred H. Sklar, the chief environmental scientist with the South Florida Water Management District. Algae blooms, a sign of water overrich in nutrients, are likely to appear, and fish kills in oxygen-depleted waters are possible, Mr. Sklar said. In Everglades National Park, the new water coming in from the gates near the Miccosukee reservation may cover alligator nests and kill off a portion of the season's unhatched or newly hatched animals. (Miccosukee representatives say the same thing has happened to alligator nests on their side when the gates are closed.) But at the same time, the washing-machine effect of the storm on the waters of the Everglades and the estuaries off the Florida coast, scientists say, can have a cleansing effect, flushing decaying plants and other debris out of the system. Mr. Sklar said that human activities, like the introduction of invasive species, have more of an effect on natural systems than hurricanes -- but hurricanes can exacerbate the impact of the human activity. Some of the invasive species, like the Australian pine, Brazilian pepper trees, the fern called lygodium and melaleuca, a eucalyptus-like tree planted by the tens of thousands because its thirsty roots helped drain the soil, are likely to be vulnerable to hurricane winds. But their seeds compete aggressively with native species in the spaces cleared by the hurricanes. The refrain in Florida is that trees and plants grow back quickly here. But the two storms damaged trees that can take decades to mature in a state not known for patience. ''It's just not going to look the same,'' Charles H. Bronson, the commissioner of the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services and a native of inland Kissimmee, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ''It looks like somebody went through with big pruning shears in these cities with the old oaks.'' Citrus trees in central Florida lost fruit and may be permanently damaged by standing water. Cypress hammocks in the south were uprooted. Stands of pine suffered. Sabal palms, the state tree, fell. Nurseries, a growing industry in the state, experienced major losses. It may be the oaks -- live, laurel and water oaks -- best reflect the tension between how parts of the state once looked and the way new development continues to alter its appearance with grand royal and date palms. ''They were here with the Indians,'' James S. Haeger, 90, a botanist in Vero Beach, said of the oaks on the town's canopied streets. So were the tree islands of the Everglades, and for the Miccosukee Indians they became part of the culture after they arrived here more than 200 years ago. But from 1940 to 1995, with the growth of development and the need to store water in holding areas like the Water Conservation Area 3A -- Miccosukee territory -- the number of tree islands in that area declined by nearly half, to 581, and the total acres declined by 60 percent, to 8,621, federal data show. Even without hurricanes, water management in south Florida creates winners and losers, or at least a sense of grievance among some of those affected. Water management for the benefit of Miami-Dade and Broward County, and for the sugar cane farms at the northern end of the Everglades has prompted the Miccosukee to file repeated lawsuits to protect their own interests. When hurricanes come, the sense of grievance rises with the water. The tribe and its experts, like the lawyer Dexter Lehitinen and the hydrological engineer Terry L. Rice, who have led legal battles to lower the water level and reduce pollution in tribal areas, say that the hurricane flows simply exacerbate problems caused by the South Florida Water Management District. Scott Thorpe, the director of the Homestead Field Station of the water management district, is not engaged in that debate right now. Mr. Thorpe is trying to alleviate the pressure of excess water throughout the system, even at the risk of pumping oxygen-depleting nutrients into the estuaries and the Everglades and degrading, for a period of time, the natural systems. His job is to minimize destructive urban flooding. ''All we can do,'' he said, ''is get rid of as much water as we can.'' HURRICANE IVAN: THE EVERGLADES"
"Hurricane Ivan spun away from Jamaica on Saturday and intensified to a dangerous Category 5 storm with winds up to 165 miles an hour as it headed toward the Gulf Coast of the United States, with the Cayman Islands and Cuba immediately in its sights. By early evening, the skies over Jamaica remained a deadly gray and government officials said the central and western parts of the 150-mile-long island were still feeling hurricane-force winds and being drenched with bursts of heavy rain. Hurricane Ivan killed at least 15 Jamaicans, including four members of a family whose home was inundated by a mudslide north of Kingston. The storm tore roofs off hundreds if not thousands of homes and businesses and knocked down trees and power lines all over the island. By Saturday night the hurricane had killed at least 56 people in the Caribbean, with most of the deaths in Grenada, The Associated Press reported. At seemingly the last possible moment, the center of Hurricane Ivan veered west late Friday from a course that would have taken it directly over Jamaica and instead steered a much less destructive path just south of the island. But heavy winds extending 175 miles from the center still battered Kingston, the gritty capital, and towns and villages along the southern coast. The northern coast towns of Montego Bay, Ocho Rios and Negril, the centers of the country's main industry, tourism, were spared the worst of the hurricane's punch. The hurricane gathered strength as the eye moved away from Jamaica in the afternoon. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the full force of the hurricane might bypass the Florida Keys, which have been evacuated, and head to the Gulf of Mexico and possibly the Florida Panhandle. On Saturday night, the hurricane center reported that the barometric pressure at the center of the hurricane's eye had dropped to 910 millibars, making Hurricane Ivan the sixth most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded, in terms of pressure. A hurricane strengthens as pressure falls. By comparison, Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, was 15th on the list. At 11 p.m. the hurricane center said the ''well-defined eye'' of the storm was heading west-northwest about 8 m.p.h., approaching the Cayman Islands, which were about 100 miles away. Hurricane-force winds extended for 70 miles and tropical-storm-force winds for 175 miles. In the Caymans, an offshore financial center that is home to about 45,000 people, the authorities told coastal residents to flee battering waves and a 15-foot storm surge, Reuters reported. Winds of up to 50 m.p.h. began to hit Grand Cayman on Saturday night, the news service said, and the authorities declared a state of emergency. Cuba began evacuating 200,000 people in the western half of the island, Reuters reported. It said the storm appeared headed for tobacco-growing areas west of Havana and not the capital, where nervous residents jammed shops to buy food, water and candles. In Jamaica, government meteorologists said the top wind speeds recorded in Kingston were about 130 m.p.h. Prime Minister P. J. Patterson said that virtually no place was untouched as the broad, slow-moving storm crawled past the island. But he said the damage was likely to fall far short of the devastation on Grenada a few days earlier. ''Mercifully,'' Mr. Patterson said, ''we were spared a direct hit.'' Mr. Patterson was criticized by political opponents for having called for a state of emergency that expanded police powers even before Hurricane Ivan's winds began to bend treetops in Kingston. Looting broke out during the storm in Montego Bay and in Kingston and was quickly brought under control by the police. Officers shot to death a suspected looter and a suspected robber and arrested 28 others for looting. Four police officers were wounded in return gunfire, said Peter Phillips, the minister of national security. Mr. Patterson said that a curfew would go into effect Saturday night in parts of Kingston and several other cities and towns around the country. But he said that he expected electricity and phone services to be restored shortly and that the international airports, vital to tourism, would probably be operating again on Sunday. Other government officials said that apart from the psychological impact of the hurricane, Jamaica's tourism business would probably be back to normal operation with 120 hotels and resorts in a few weeks. Horace Peterkin, a vice president of the hotel and tourist association and the manager of Sandals Montego Bay, a large self-contained resort, said, ''None of the hotels suffered any serious damage.'' About 15,000 tourists were stranded in hotels on the north coast, and, Mr. Peterkin said, ''every hotel is reporting their guests are safe.'' Mr. Peterkin, whose resort consists of a string of small buildings along the beach in Montego Bay, moved his guests into the concrete and steel building of the nearby Ritz Hotel as a precaution before the storm. Other managers of beachfront hotels took similar steps. During the storm, many hotels asked guests to take shelter in ballrooms and dining rooms, rather than stay in their rooms with big glass windows and glass sliding doors. ''We all slept in the ballroom, and we had a nice friendly atmosphere,'' Mr. Peterkin said. Robert McIntosh, a business development manager for Siemens, the German electronics and communications company, and his wife, Donna, checked into Sandals Montego Bay on Wednesday as reports of the coming hurricane were filling the radio and television airwaves. Mr. McIntosh said he had paid in advance and did not want to lose his money. He said Sandals was offering refunds, but only to those who were already in Jamaica. Mr. McIntosh said the evening spent on the floor of the Ritz ballroom with just a pillow, blankets and sheets was ''actually fine, taking into consideration the situation.'' For many people in Kingston and nearby, the hurricane was a terrifying experience as winds and rain picked up steadily from about noon Friday and then pounded the city for much of the night. Early Saturday morning a woman from Bull Bay, southeast of Kingston, told Radio Jamaica that the hurricane was stripping off parts of her roof and that her home was flooded. ''We're really stressed out and totally nervous,'' the woman said. ''We're cold and we're shivering and we're not able to do anything.'' At one point, Barbara Carby, the director general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, said she was receiving ''many, many calls'' from people who had lost their roofs. Over the radio, she advised those with roofs being torn apart to ''get in a closet or the bathtub and pull mattresses over you.'' Officials were uncertain where the approaching storm would make landfall in the United States. Initial expectations were that the Florida Keys were directly in the hurricane's path, and earlier this week an evacuation order for the 100-mile stretch of the island chain sent thousands of people on a northern trek. It has been 40 years since three hurricanes ravaged Florida in a single season, and the state is still dealing with the aftermath of the two earlier storms. HURRICANE IVAN: THE STORM"
"As Hurricane Ivan approached Jamaica last week, government and business leaders worried that the country's fragile economic recovery would be knocked into a tailspin. But while at least 15 people died in the storm over the weekend, damage was generally lighter than expected. The vital tourism business and the country's second-largest industry, bauxite mining, seem to have been barely touched. ''We're going to come out of this really nicely,'' said Garfield Sinclair, the president and chief operating officer of the investment bank Dehring, Bunting & Golding Ltd. in Kingston. Economists said that aid from the United States and other countries, which had already started to flow, and payments from insurance companies to cover some of the hurricane damage would give Jamaica a lift. They said they also expected Jamaicans living abroad to increase the money they send home -- already the country's biggest source of income at $1.13 billion a year. The last big storm to hit Jamaica, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, united the island's citizens, economists said, and the result was greater productivity. ''People tend to pull together and work twice as hard after a hurricane,'' Mr. Sinclair said. Economists said they were encouraged by developments in Jamaica but cautioned that nothing could be taken for granted in a country that for most of the 1990's had little or no growth, saddled itself with enormous debt and three years ago suffered a serious setback as vacationers curtailed air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It will take careful management and a bit of luck, they said, for the recovery that resumed last year to stay on course. Hurricane Ivan, one of the most powerful storms to rise out of the Atlantic this year, charged toward Jamaica last Friday with wind speeds of up to 155 miles an hour. But the hurricane veered westerly and took a much less destructive path south of Jamaica, battering Kingston, the capital, and towns and villages along the southern coast, ripping off roofs, knocking down power lines and flooding homes and streets. Heavy damage was reported in a few pockets of the country. But the heart of Jamaica's tourist business along the north coast was spared the worst of the storm. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said in an interview on Monday that he was waiting for assessments from around the country before issuing an estimate on total losses from the hurricane. Tourism in particular seems to be coming back quickly. As the tailwinds of the hurricane were still lashing the western part of the island on Sunday, the airport in Montego Bay, Jamaica's main tourist gateway on the north coast, reopened. The air-conditioning at the airport was a little spotty, government officials said, but on Monday the airport welcomed several hundred vacationers from Europe and the United States, and planes once again began flying from the international airport here in the capital. ''Within two weeks all the hotels on the north coast will be fully functional,'' said Godfrey G. Dyer, the president of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourism Association and the owner of a small hotel in Montego Bay. ''We thought the hurricane was going to be devastating. But it turns out to be not bad at all.'' In the months before Hurricane Ivan, earnings from tourism were about 10 percent above those in 2003. That year was the country's best ever, with earnings estimated at $1.07 billion. Mr. Dyer said that short-term growth would probably slow as a result of the hurricane but that earnings for the year would still probably set another record. Business investment may also be stepping up. Spanish hotel companies agreed this year to build four hotels on the north coast, adding 5,000 rooms to the 20,000 that Jamaica now offers. Moreover, American and Canadian investors pledged to spend $1 billion in Jamaica's bauxite industry. For the last few years, China has had a voracious appetite for bauxite, the raw material for aluminum. Prices have jumped and Jamaica has been stepping up production. In an interview at Jamaica House, the headquarters for the government, Omar Davies, the finance minister, said that even with the effects of Hurricane Ivan, the chances were good that the country's roughly $8 billion economy would grow at the anticipated 2.5 percent to 3 percent this year, up from 2.1 percent in 2003. For all its tropical allure and the reputation of its 2.7 million people for industriousness, Jamaica has often been bypassed by foreign investors. One reason has been violent crime, several government officials and independent economists said. Most of the violence has been among gangs of Jamaicans aligned with the major political parties or involved in shipping cocaine from Latin America and home-grown marijuana to the United States and Europe. But sometimes tourists have been robbed or killed and businesses have been forced to pay protection money. ''The cost of doing business here includes private security,'' Mr. Sinclair said. In the early 1990's, Jamaica suffered runaway inflation, with prices rising at one time by 80 percent a year. To curb the inflation, the central bank raised interest rates, making it costly for individuals and businesses to borrow. The inflation rate dropped sharply, though it is still more than 10 percent. But Jamaica's banks began to experience trouble. To attract deposits that they could lend at a profit, many agreed to pay high interest rates on certificates of deposit of several years. As inflation and interest rates fell, the banks still had to pay the higher rates. But earnings on new loans were lower, creating an income gap that eventually bankrupted some lenders. Government officials said corruption and poor management led to more bank failures. The government cushioned the losses to depositors with borrowed money that added to an already large debt that for years had been hobbling growth. Jamaica now owes $11.6 billion, and spends a staggering 65 percent of its annual revenue of about $400 million to pay interest. Jamaica's economy began to pick up in 2001 with modest growth of 1.5 percent. But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks led many Americans to avoid flying, and tourism in Jamaica fell 10 percent, reducing growth in 2002 to 1.1 percent. The economy started coming back last year, and growth in the first quarter of 2004 was 2.4 percent. The government has been limiting spending to try to curtail borrowing. But with expenses caused by the hurricane, the government is facing the prospect of cutting back on two big projects -- building a four-lane highway from Kingston to the north coast and improving the north coast highway. Both are regarded as fundamentals for future economic growth. ''The overall picture for the economy is that we're going to have a temporary setback,'' said Mr. Dyer. ''But I think everything is going to move forward and the country's plans will not vary too much.'' Peter Moses, who is in charge of Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, in Jamaica, said the economy was likely to rebound faster after Hurricane Ivan than after Hurricane Gilbert 16 years ago. ''I'm optimistic,'' he said. ''But if tourism takes too long to get back on track and if some of the infrastructure projects get delayed, we could lose our momentum. Our key economic ingredients have to come back up to speed quickly for the hurricane not to have a medium- or longer-term negative impact.''"
"Every highway out of this city below sea level ground to a near halt for most of Tuesday as residents heeded evacuation orders. They left the neighborhood of the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain to join tens of thousands of people from a 300-mile swath of the Gulf Coast in fleeing Hurricane Ivan and winds of nearly 140 miles an hour. Gloria Hogan, a 72-year-old retired nursing assistant, was preparing to join the exodus, driving to Houston on Tuesday evening with her husband, Moses, who uses a wheelchair, and three other relatives. ''I'm afraid,'' Ms. Hogan said. ''I live in a low area. Most of my neighbors are gone. I'm just afraid of the intensity of this storm.'' The huge storm, which the National Hurricane Center called ''extremely dangerous,'' is a Category 4, the second-strongest rating. The center said it was moving north-northwest in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and, with winds extending 105 miles from the eye, was pushing a large storm surge ahead of it. Hurricane Ivan has killed at least 68 people in its slow trek across Grenada, Jamaica, Grand Cayman Island and Cuba, and is expected to make landfall early Thursday somewhere between Grand Isle, La., and Apalachicola, Fla. If it bends west toward the mouth of the Mississippi, New Orleans, downriver from the huge petrochemical industry, could face anything from the normal low-level flooding that plagues the city in the rainy season to a catastrophic deluge from the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain, one that could inundate homes one or two stories high, experts from Louisiana State University said Tuesday afternoon. Urgent preparations for the storm took place from hurricane-battered Florida to Louisiana to the gulf itself, where workers were evacuated from offshore oil rigs. Oil production in the gulf was cut by about a million barrels a day, the federal government estimated. The Port of New Orleans, a major gateway for steel, cotton and containerized shipping, closed Tuesday at 1 p.m. By evening, the mayor, C. Ray Nagin, was giving radio interviews urging residents to leave. His pleas were echoed one state over by Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi. ''I beg people on the coast: do not ride this storm out,'' Mr. Barbour said. New Orleans is sandwiched between the lower end of the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. Marc Levitan, director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, said: ''The course it's on right now has New Orleans in its gun sights. If it doesn't turn, that could potentially dump an awful lot of water into the bowl.'' National Hurricane Center forecasters predicted on Tuesday night that the storm would make landfall near the Alabama-Mississippi border. But given the storm's size, it will have an impact far beyond there, especially since this part of the country has been adding population, housing and businesses -- particularly casinos -- rapidly over the past two decades. Tides in areas all along the threatened part of the Gulf Coast were already running a foot above normal, forecasters said, adding to the likelihood that Hurricane Ivan could cause substantial coastal flooding and erosion. Even if the eye of the storm stays east of Louisiana, hurricane-force winds could threaten New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, said Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The counterclockwise swirl of the hurricane could bring strong gusts across the shallow lake, and this could raise ''tremendous waves'' capable of topping levees, Mr. Mayfield said. Before it moved out into open water, Hurricane Ivan pounded the western provinces of Cuba early Tuesday with winds and waves that flooded several communities and carried others out to sea. The Cuban authorities said they were still assessing the damage. A visit to some of the areas hit by the storm indicated that thousands of people had lost their homes. But most people sought refuge long before the hurricane reached the nation. Ivan is the second hurricane to hit Cuba in a month. In August, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated $1 billion in damage and at least four deaths. Boca de Galafre, a village on the southwest coast of Cuba, was all but gone when its residents returned Tuesday. Winds were still raging, and the ocean crashed over concrete foundations where houses used to be. All Maria Montenegro found when she came home was a wooden roof. ''We already suffer so much,'' Ms. Montenegro said through tears. ''I wonder why God makes us suffer more?'' Most people, however, seemed relieved and resilient. ''Stop crying,'' a neighbor shouted to Ms. Montenegro. The home of the neighbor, Antonio Padron, was missing its front and back walls. ''At least we are alive.'' Along the hurricane's potential path, the rituals of plywood sawing and fastening, gasoline hunting and indecision about going or staying, so familiar to residents of the Florida coasts this season, were being repeated across Alabama, Mississippi and eastern Louisiana on Tuesday. In Gulf Shores, a resort in Alabama that was potentially facing a direct hit, the beachfront road, lined with vacation homes, was nearly deserted by Tuesday afternoon as a mandatory evacuation order by Gov. Bob Riley was widely heeded. Most vehicles were pulling boats or trailers, and the only people outside were hammering up plywood or packing possessions. ''No other store is open on the island and I plan to shut down in about an hour,'' said John Hamrick, the manager of Pier 33 Groceries. ''I've been giving out ice because I am sure this freezer will blow away.'' Surveying the street, Mr. Hamrick tilted back a baseball cap that identified him as a volunteer firefighter and wondered at the construction of homes across the street. ''When you look at those five condominiums, you have to wonder which ones will still be here next week,'' he said. ''I just don't understand why people keep building them so flimsy.'' In Pensacola, Fla., a Navy town not far from the Alabama border, many trailer parks and coastal neighborhoods had begun emptying out by Tuesday morning, even before mandatory evacuation orders were issued. At a Lowe's home improvement store, the morning shipment of plywood and gas cans was gone by 1 p.m. An electronic billboard welcoming tourists to Pensacola Beach carried the message of the day in bright red letters: ''Evacuate Now!''"
"When Hurricane Frances cut through this low-lying barrier island off the east coast of Florida just three weeks ago, every permanent resident of the Ocean Harbor North condominiums quickly cleared out. As Hurricane Jeanne approached this weekend, residents once again made hurricane preparations, but, mindful of difficulties reaching their homes after Hurricane Frances, some of their plans did not include evacuation. ''We got so frustrated with police denying us access to our home on the bridges that my son and husband finally swam for an hour across the inland waterway to get here,'' said Jean Downing, 64, the president of the condominium complex association, who rode out Hurricane Frances in Fort Myers. ''We didn't want to face that problem this time.'' Those weathering Hurricane Jeanne, a Category 3 storm, in the condominium's aging white high-rise concrete buildings included 11 of the roughly 20 permanent residents, one of whom is a quadriplegic woman who insisted on returning home from the hospital by ambulance for the storm. The residents of Ocean Harbor North were not alone on the island. A drive down the heavily flooded main road hours after the storm's passage showed cars tossed across parking lots, walls sheared off buildings and the occasional image of suburbia-meets-a-hurricane with residents clearing chunks of metal debris off impeccably manicured lawns. Those staying behind knowingly set themselves up for what may turn into a real-life version of ''Survivor'': Anyone can leave, but bridges back onto the island will remain closed by police for up to a week. The nonchalance shown by residents in the face of the storm has officials worried as they realize how many stayed behind, raising concerns over behavior in future storms. ''I call it the Frances-phobia,'' said Nathan McCollum, emergency management coordinator for Indian River County. ''People saw their property made it through Frances, so they think they can make it through any hurricane.'' For Hurricane Jeanne, Indian River County emergency shelters housed only about half the 5,500 people who sought refuge during Hurricane Frances. ''I've definitely got a job over the next few months to educate our public about the intensity of hurricanes,'' Mr. McCollum said. ''People should not think in terms of hurricane, they should think about the category.'' For Diana Corbett, 61, a woman rendered quadriplegic decades ago by a car accident, there was no question of weathering Hurricane Jeanne in Saint Lucie Medical Center, as she did during Hurricane Frances. ''How could I fear staying here?'' Ms. Corbett asked Sunday. ''This place is too beautiful and my neighbors are too wonderful.'' Her attitude came despite losing a $17,000 electric wheelchair and a treasured antique carousel pony when Hurricane Frances shattered her patio windows and made her apartment unlivable during repairs, which are not done yet. In addition to the underlying difficulties raised by her paralysis, Ms. Corbett also recently underwent a series of leg operations. She arrived Friday by ambulance directly from the hospital and settled into a friend's apartment. (Her own apartment remained too damaged by Hurricane Frances.) ''She was determined to come back, and I was not going to leave her side,'' said Brenda Hayes, 49, her roommate and primary caregiver. ''I came here because I had to, not because I wanted to.'' Caring for her paralyzed roommate through a hurricane and its aftermath of possible weeks without electricity required a high level of preparation. The wounds from the leg operations made a consistent electric supply to Ms. Corbett's air mattress absolutely crucial. Designed for those bedridden for long periods of time, the mattress is kept inflated by a constant breeze pumped in from an electric fan. ''Electricity is not exactly my lifeline,'' Ms. Corbett said. ''But I cannot stay here for long without it.'' So, Ms. Corbett and Ms. Hayes made arrangements to have a generator, and they stocked up on food. Ms. Corbett, for all the preparations and attitude, admitted to being worried when the winds picked up at the height of the storm. ''You could hear things going by like missiles,'' she said. ''I got a little scared when the tractor-trailer was blown across the parking lot.'' Ms. Hayes said she was at times petrified. A fire could be seen during the storm in the adjoining mobile home park, perhaps sparked by a broken transformer. For all the worries, Ms. Corbett says she would do it again. Ms. Hayes said she would follow her roommate if necessary. For Charlie and Lee Kristofs, preparations to weather the hurricane centered around their cat. ''Sta'sl is a boat cat, so we didn't want her to be scared by a window blowing in,'' Ms. Kristofs said, in explaining why they took refuge for nearly 12 hours in the building's 10-foot by 12-foot windowless garbage room. ''I did get kind of scared when my ears started popping with the pressure changes as the eye went overhead.'' Changes in air pressure, or perhaps simply wind, shattered most of the windows in their blue Chevrolet Astro van inwards, leaving the vehicle's carpet littered with glass shards. The Kristofses' decision to stay through Hurricane Jeanne came thanks to their experience with Hurricane Frances. ''We just moved here, so we didn't know what a hurricane would be like and listened to the warnings,'' Ms. Kristofs said. ''This time we had the confidence to stay.'' Not every resident who stayed behind in the Ocean Harbor North complex thought it was such a good idea. ''I would never do it again,'' said Duck Goodman, 74, a retired fireman from Wilmington, Del. ''I know buildings under stress, and I am absolutely sure the building moved.'' Mr. Goodman regretted his decision to stay in his fifth floor apartment just after midnight when he heard heavy debris moving outside, but it was too late to leave. ''My wife was scared to death, and I was scared pretty good myself,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''I completely regretted being there.'' For Ms. Downing, president of the condominium association, being there to clean up quickly was worth the danger. ''We have started cleaning up right away, which makes a big difference,'' she said. ''Right about this time after Frances we were waiting over there on the mainland.''"
"Hurricane Jeanne delivered walls of stinging rain and winds of up to 120 miles an hour as it spun across Florida on Sunday, making landfall almost exactly where Hurricane Frances did over Labor Day weekend and waging the third assault in six weeks on the state's sodden midsection. The storm caused at least five deaths, including a man who was electrocuted touching a downed power line in Miami. A man and woman were killed, officials said, when their sport utility vehicle plunged into a canal beside the Sawgrass Expressway, near Deerfield Beach. A man drowned in Palm Bay when his pickup truck was submerged and a boy, 15, died after he was pinned by a falling tree in Clay County, southwest of Jacksonville, The Associated Press said. The storm was also responsible for more than 1,500 deaths in grievous flooding in Haiti, 24 deaths in the Dominican Republic and 7 in Puerto Rico before it moved over the Bahamas and into Florida. While widespread, the storm's damage in Florida did not appear as catastrophic as that after Hurricane Charley, which devastated parts of southwest and central Florida on Aug. 13, and Hurricane Ivan, which brutalized the Pensacola region on Sept. 17. Flooding was perhaps the biggest problem, after hours of heavy rainfall in areas already saturated by past storms. Roofs and siding, possibly weakened by the last hurricane, flew off or sprang leaks, and piles of old storm debris went flying. The storm, then classified as a Category 3 hurricane, made landfall on Hutchinson Island, just south of Fort Pierce, shortly before midnight, when the sky had an eerie blue cast caused by transformer explosions. It moved northwesterly across the state, lashing inland agricultural regions that had already suffered mightily and weakening to a tropical storm as it turned north toward Georgia. By late Sunday night, its maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 m.p.h. With its arrival, Florida became the first state to experience four hurricanes in a season since Texas in 1886, according to the National Hurricane Center. Eqecat, a California company specializing in risk evaluation, estimated the damage to insured property was $6 billion to $14 billion. The previous three storms, which were blamed for at least 70 deaths, caused tens of billions of dollars in damage. ''This is unprecedented; there's been nothing like it,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said as he visited the emergency operations center in St. Lucie County, adding that the relief effort for the combined storms was the largest in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's history. ''Certainly it's the largest series of natural disasters we've faced.'' More than 1.5 million customers in 38 counties lacked electricity after Hurricane Jeanne came through, state officials said, though some power failures were from earlier storms. Shelters were housing about 61,000 residents, only a fraction of the two million who were urged to evacuate coastal areas. Many said that after relocating weeks earlier, they could not bear the stress of moving again to a shelter or hotel and leaving their property and pets unattended. Julie Monti, 86, said she stayed at home in Micco, about 30 miles north of Fort Pierce, because a shelter would not have welcomed her sickly dog. While she huddled in a closet overnight, the hurricane peeled the roof and walls off the second floor of her house, leaving a soaked tangle of furniture and a lonely looking fireplace. ''I tried to get a state trooper on the highway to help today,'' she said. ''He told me, 'Lady, you're lucky you're alive, there's people trapped in houses.''' Mrs. Monti said she had owned the house for years but had just moved full time in July, after selling her other home, in Stanhope, N.J. She does not have insurance, she said. She was trying to cover blown-out windows with tarp, unsteady on a slippery foot stool as the rain began to fall again. Her yard was a sea of broken lawn statues: gnomes, flamingos, dolphins, goddesses. She said she had tried to call FEMA four times after Hurricane Frances, which damaged a building in back of her house, but could not get through. ''Look at my furniture up there,'' she said, her voice quavering as she surveyed the wreckage with brimming eyes. ''I want to go back to Jersey.'' Just up Route 1 in Barefoot Bay, a community of 5,000 manufactured homes that Hurricane Jeanne hit especially hard, Charles Sweeney, 71, was trying to determine which damage was new and which was old. ''Half of this was Frances,'' he said, pointing to a roofless, screenless porch, ''and the rest, all the way through the back, was Jeanne.'' In the Tampa Bay area, which had not expected to be in the storm's path (until late Saturday, most forecasts had that predicted it would move straight up the state's east coast or only slightly to the west), many residents were unprepared as the wind arrived on Sunday afternoon. ''We don't even have groceries this time,'' said Laura Keane of St. Petersburg. ''We did so much the other two or three times. This time we didn't do anything. It was like, huh, oh, well.'' In Polk County, where the storm's eye, surrounded by the strongest winds, passed over the most populous areas, Cindy Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the county emergency management office, said several trailer parks were in terrible shape. ''It looks like tarp city out there,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''All these tarps that were on the roofs damaged by Charley are now floating down the streets.'' The small town of Mulberry lost use of its wastewater treatment plant during the storm, she said, which caused sewage to pour onto streets. She said that before Hurricane Jeanne arrived there had been a good deal of denial in Polk County, which she said was the only county in the direct path of three hurricanes. ''We think, 'It can't possibly hit here again,''' Ms. Rodriguez said. More than 3,500 National Guard troops were supervising recovery from Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Jeanne on Sunday, and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana approved a request from Gov. Bush to send about 200 additional troops from her state to Florida. As the storm churned north, many people admitted to feeling numb in its wake, and the wake of three others. And they were well aware that hurricane season is far from over. ''Every single weekend I think, 'Oh my God, I've got to sit through another one of these,''' said Eden Healt, 33, of Tampa. ''You get mentally tired and emotionally and physically, just tired. Like a zombie going through your day.'' Across the state in Micco, Mrs. Monti stopped sweeping her eyes across the wreckage of her house and yard and focused on a piece of siding on the ground. She picked it up and gently set it on a birdbath. Then she shuffled back inside."
"The lights went out about 2 a.m. Sunday for the Patel family here, just as they did 23 days earlier. Through the night the family listened to the rain dripping into the 20 buckets they had set out in the living room. The tarps that covered the missing 25-foot section of their roof could not keep out the rain. After Hurricane Charley, Harry Patel had called an insurance adjuster to come take a look at their family home and business, the London Inn, but decided against starting work on anything more permanent. ''What's the point of making repairs now and having it blown away?'' Mr. Patel said as he awaited Hurricane Frances. Lake Wales had not experienced a major hurricane since Donna in 1960. But if the paths of the eyes of Hurricanes Charley and Frances are drawn across a map of Florida -- one slicing to the northeast toward the Atlantic, the other northwest toward the Gulf of Mexico -- this city of 12,000, nestled among squat orange groves and clear lakes, is located more or less at the intersection. ''You see that cross?'' asked Jackie Patel, the mother, drawing an ''X'' in the air with her fingers. ''We are at the center of that cross.'' A bull's-eye now hit twice. In the days since Hurricane Charley, the water had been made safe to drink again, the power was back on, the schools were open, the supermarkets sold cold food, and you could buy gas at the pump rather than by the bucket. Then came Hurricane Frances. ''We were just getting back to normal,'' said Helen McLeod, 68, a resident of Parakeet Park, a mobile home park for retirees that is again without electricity or telephone service. The residents now operate a generator, but only enough to run the television for hurricane updates and a communal refrigerator for food salvaged from their various homes. They play cards, cook and eat together in the park's recreation room. Central Florida was supposed to be cheaper and safer than the coastal areas, Southern sunshine at a fraction of the risk and the price. ''When I moved here it was because they didn't have hurricanes,'' Ms. McLeod said. ''It made us feel secure.'' Hurricane Charley had damaged the back of the roof of Ms. McLeod's mobile home. Hurricane Frances, with winds moving in the opposite direction, damaged the front. ''Both did damage on either side,'' she said. As other residents returned home Sunday night to assess the damage, they were more relieved than not, given their experience three weeks ago. There were additional leaks, flapping blue roof tarps that had been blown off, and some additional damage to already shaky structures. But there was not the same level of torn aluminum and wood. Emotionally, however, this hurricane experience had been more stressful. ''This one is more depressing because of the time spent waiting,'' said Marilyn Moore, 68, also a resident of Parakeet Park. ''The other one was quick and fast.'' While Hurricane Charley blew through Lake Wales in a matter of about two hours in the evening, by Sunday evening many residents had been hunkered down almost 48 hours at shelters to wait out Hurricane Frances. But the Parakeet Park residents took the wait in good spirits, playing cards throughout the night. They also took bets to see which way a precariously situated palm tree that was moved and replanted after the first hurricane would fall. They painted their initials in a circle around the palm tree to stake their positions. The tree, they were happy to learn, stayed upright throughout the storm. City officials wanted to move forward with recovery from Hurricane Charley, which had been stalled a few weeks. But only a third of the debris had been picked up before the dump trucks were pulled out to wait out Hurricane Frances, and almost none of the roofs had been fixed. On Wednesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency shut down its operation at the Eagle Ridge Mall, where workers had been distributing everything from peanut butter sandwiches to $5,000 checks. ''You know you are in trouble when FEMA leaves,'' said the fire chief, Tom Tonker. ''They said they would be back next week.'' Others wanted the disruption to be minimal. ''I want to go back to school,'' said Rickin Patel, who was practicing his saxophone under a dripping roof as the waning gusts of Hurricane Frances blew by outside. His father said he now planned to repair the roof himself. But local officials are also worried about whether the relief efforts can be as robust for the second time in three weeks. ''Hundreds of truckloads of food, water, ice and baby supplies were brought in two weeks ago for Charley,'' said Randy Wilkinson, a Polk County commissioner. ''We already stressed the supply line across the country. They have been very generous in getting supplies to us. We don't know how much we have exhausted the surplus.'' But hurricane season has 86 days to go, and the prospect of even more hurricanes has left the residents on edge. Yet another storm, Ivan, reached hurricane strength on Sunday in the central Atlantic. ''If Ivan hits, I'm leaving the state of Florida,'' said Pat Thomas, 56, a Lake Wales resident who spent the night at a shelter with her husband and grandson. ''I had to watch my parents lose their home,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''I've watched my father fall apart as he lost his home.'' Ms. Thomas, whose parents also live in Lake Wales, rented a 40-foot trailer to store the belongings from her parents' damaged home and sent her parents across the state border to Macon, Ga. When she returned home, she was in better spirits when she found both her home and the trailer with her parents' belongings intact. ''We're grateful that the good Lord watched over us twice, and that he will do it again,'' she said. Ms. Moore, of Parakeet Park, said she did not want to think about another hurricane gathering strength. ''They should have waited until tomorrow to tell us about Hurricane Ivan,'' she said. ''Today is not the day. This one is not even out before they tell us about the other one. No mercy.'' HURRICANE FRANCES: THE BULL'S-EYE"
"The battery was dying on the baby's apnea monitor in the shelter in Fort Pierce as volunteers scrambled for extension cords. Rain was falling directly on kitchen counters in roofless mobile homes outside Vero Beach. Farther inland, green, unripe grapefruit rode the white-capping swells in citrus groves, like lumber rolling down a river. It was all the work of Hurricane Frances. If the storm's apathetic wobble through Florida on Saturday and Sunday disappointed those seeking extreme-weather visuals, it still provided plenty of genuine devastation for those in its path. It may have done the least damage to those who have most. On Sunday afternoon, as the wind and rain eased and National Guard trucks rolled into town, Bill Ransom, public safety sergeant for a beachfront sliver called Indian River Shores, one of Florida's most affluent communities, said early reports suggested his area had suffered relatively little. ''It's looking up so far,'' Mr. Ransom said. Later reports said some beachfront communities had suffered serious damage but, said Deputy Joe Flescher of the Indian River County Sheriff's Office, ''certainly far less than we had anticipated.'' Instead, Hurricane Frances caused a selective and unsympathetic kind of ruin. Many mobile homes just off U.S. 1 in Indian River and St. Lucie Counties were destroyed. Their roofs and walls had collapsed, leaving coffee pots to catch the rain. Along inland rural roads, cows climbed to higher ground in flooded fields. Shredded citrus trees rose through knee deep currents that covered some groves. Fruit fell far before anyone would have wanted to pick it. ''Early harvest,'' said Niles Cooney, 74, striving for good humor as he looked across his wasted 25 acres west of Fort Pierce. Power was out, water was off, and stores were closed across the region. Some drivers ran out of gas. One woman, Elizabeth Williams, waited in the rain beneath an overpass on Route 70 for someone to help fill her tank. She had stored extra fuel in her trunk but could not put together the two-part gas funnel by herself. She had only one hand. ''I thought it would be a cinch,'' she said. Gov. Jeb Bush said 233 shelters housed 85,934 people statewide on Saturday night. At the Fort Pierce Civic Center, converted since Thursday into a shelter for people with special medical needs, extensive ceiling leaks and an ominously rattling roof forced county workers and volunteers to move all 238 people out of the main auditorium just as the storm's fiercest winds arrived about 11 p.m. By midnight, elderly people on walkers and oxygen tubes hobbled over extension cords in the dark hallway where people had been moved. The rechargeable battery on a premature baby's apnea monitor was slowly dying until someone, somehow, found yet another cord. At one point, a man sitting nearby began trying to pull one of the monitor's plugs out of the extension cord. ''No, no, no!'' the mother said. ''You're taking two plugs!'' said the man, as others pulled him away. ''That's not fair! I need some juice, too!'' Some who did not need electrical support were moved into cubicles of the county tax collector's office. One woman in a wheelchair slept face down on a desk. On Sunday morning, Bunny Richards, the St. Lucie County Health Department's nursing director, who is supervising the shelter, said she had heard news reports that people had died at the shelter as a result of the trouble. No one had. ''We medicated some people who became combative,'' she said. ''But that happens with the older folks. For the most part everyone's been congenial.'' She also said she was ''hot'', as in angry, that the county had provided what proved to be an inadequate facility. ''They said this building was safe,'' she said. Samuel Ealy's small green wood-frame house lost roof tiles, and the tin roof on his shed partly peeled off. ''It sounded like some big diesel was coming through,'' said Mr. Ealy, 55, whose wife and kids left on Thursday to stay with a friend. ''She said, 'I love you, but I'm not going to stay with you,''' he said. Far inland, beneath the 30-foot levee of Lake Okeechobee in Okeechobee County, Tony Blankenbaker stayed up with friends in a mobile home at Taylor Creek Lodge Marina. His home was spared, but, he said, ''We watched the roofs fly by last night.'' While some areas tried to enforce 24-hour curfews, Indian River County allowed residents out between 2 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Sunday, even as power lines lay across roads and traffic lights sometimes dangled a few feet from the asphalt. ''These people have been in the shelter since Thursday, so we're doing everything we can,'' said Nathan McCollum, the emergency management coordinator for the county.Yet the region was paralyzed by -- and consumed with -- the storm. People called radio stations to ask when schools would be open, when power would be back on, when they could go home, how to purify water. The answer to the first three: Hard to say. To the fourth: Add a few drops of unscented bleach to a gallon of water, shake, wait and serve. One caller noted that yet another hurricane, Ivan, was moving west toward the Caribbean. ''Now we're talking about Ivan the terrible, right?'' she said. HURRICANE FRANCES: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK"
"Hurricane Frances relentlessly enveloped most of Florida on Sunday in severe squalls, lashing rain and scattershot destruction. In its wide wake, millions of residents were left without power and hundreds of thousands without ready access to gasoline, groceries or other daily staples. Doors and roofs were ripped from an uncounted number of homes and businesses, leaving them exposed to the 6 to 10 inches of rain that poured over them by late afternoon. Two deaths were reported as the hurricane plodded across the peninsula on a path that took it to some of the same stops that Hurricane Charley visited three weeks ago. In the Gainesville area, a man was killed when his car hit a tree, and a woman died when a tree crashed into her mobile home, The Associated Press reported. Two people had been killed in storm-related accidents in the Bahamas before the eye of Hurricane Frances crossed Florida's eastern coastline at Sewall's Point, north of Palm Beach, at 1 a.m. on Sunday. Florida's infrastructure took a major pounding. In West Palm Beach, rainwater undercut a section of the right lane of northbound Interstate 95, creating a sinkhole that tore away parts of the roadway and a guard rail. Economic analysts estimated that the damage caused by Hurricanes Charley and Frances together could be as much as $40 billion. At a time when hurricanes seem a chronic affliction here -- Hurricane Ivan, a storm recently spawned in the eastern Atlantic, is providing new grist for anxiety -- many battered and exhausted residents seemed relieved that the slow, huge bulk of Hurricane Frances had not inflicted more pain. The sustained winds of 105 miles per hour when the hurricane crossed the eastern coastline -- which made it a Category 2 hurricane -- dwindled to 70 m.p.h., the level of topical storm winds, as it approached the western coastline near Tampa 18 hours later. The storm's center reached the west coast just before midnight, weather officials said. ''Evidently our hopes and prayers did help, because I truly think it could have been worse,'' said Ronald G. Swank, the mayor of Titusville, a town across the Indian River from the Kennedy Space Center, where 90 m.p.h. winds left the tan roof of DeForest Realty draped across Route 1, along with a tangle of downed poles and power lines. In Kennedy Point Yacht club, a houseboat had impaled itself on a nearby sailboat, and virtually no business on Route 1 still possessed a sign by dusk, said Todd Hutchinson, a spokesman for the town's emergency operations center. But the storm could regain its strength as it passes over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico on the way to the Florida panhandle. Many residents of four Panhandle counties were urged to evacuate. In the rest of the state, nearly 100,000 people had taken refuge in 408 temporary shelters, and 16 counties had declared some kind of curfew. Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, visiting the National Hurricane Center in Miami after surveying storm damage in a brief visit to Palm Beach County on Sunday afternoon, said that one good thing about two powerful hurricanes in a row was that it rid the state of ''hurricane amnesia,'' a condition he said afflicted many residents because they had not experienced a major storm in years. ''We don't have that anymore,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We've have had it up to this year because we dodged a few bullets.'' In areas like Orlando, which suffered much worse damage during Hurricane Charley but went through a milder, if far longer, ordeal this time around, it was limbs, not whole trees, that were most often the cause of roof damage or road blockage. The brown leafy debris left by Hurricane Charley skittered across the roads and parking lots ahead of Hurricane Frances' winds, and in a few places, a pile of debris was nearly blotted from sight by the still-green branches that fell early on Sunday morning. Inland, in Polk County, where the eye of Hurricane Frances crossed over the path that the eye of Hurricane Charley had taken last month, a few squat orange trees, which had already largely been stripped of their fruit, cracked and toppled shortly before the peak of the storm passed through. Polk County had already lost 20 percent of its orange crop -- damage that will most likely affect juice prices in a few years. Around Polk County, blue tarps flapped in the strong wind on thousands of damaged roofs in the city, but most stayed in place. A few more branches fell down, but they blended in with the ones from already toppled trees that are waiting to be cut down. ''It's mostly cosmetic damage,'' said Randy Wilkinson, a Polk County commissioner. ''We came out of it pretty good so far.'' But one of the state's signature businesses, Walt Disney World, which had stayed open through Friday, catering in part to tourists when Orlando International Airport closed at noon, was prepared to reopen Monday. The extent of damage at the Kennedy Space Center was still unknown Sunday evening. NASA officials said they were unable to get teams into the center because the winds were still higher than the 40 m.p.h. limit for safely crossing the causeway. The center will be closed through Monday at least, said a NASA spokeswoman, Melissa Mathews. All three of the country's remaining space shuttles, which are worth $2 billion apiece, are in hangars there. ''At this point they are feeling fairly optimistic, given the kind of wind speed when it made landfall, and where it made landfall,'' Ms. Mathews said. President Bush talked to Governor Bush, his brother, on Sunday afternoon to assure Floridians that federal resources were in place to aid in the recovery, a White House spokesman, Trent Duffy, told The Associated Press. Some 8,000 members of the National Guard were also assigned to recovery efforts, The A.P. reported. Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center, which is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, said that Hurricane Frances had been downgraded to a tropical storm at 5 p.m., but that rain bands that are the whip-ends of the large storm would continue to hammer the entire Florida peninsula Sunday night and reach into Georgia. Mr. Mayfield said the storm would likely move into the Gulf of Mexico by Monday morning, possibly strengthening to hurricane status before returning to land somewhere in the Panhandle. A hurricane warning was in effect for a long strip of the Gulf Coast, from Anna Maria Island to Destin. Mr. Mayfield said some areas of the Gulf Coast, like St. George Island and Dog Island, could suffer storm surges of six or seven feet even if the storm did not regain strength. Meanwhile, tree-trimming trucks and electrical workers from across the state were poised to move into areas struck by the storm. The parking lot of a Holiday Inn near the Orlando airport looked like a heavy-equipment dealer, as rows of identical orange vehicles crowned by cherry-pickers were lined up near the cars of refugee tourists and homeowners. Power outages were particularly widespread along the central coast. In Palm Beach County, one of the state's most populous, with 1.2 million people, almost 90 percent of the households were without power on Sunday, and a similar percentage of homes lost power in Martin County. Eqecat, an Oakland, Calif., company specializing in risk evaluation, estimated that the direct costs of Hurricane Frances would be about $4 billion, or about half those of Hurricane Charley. But the economic ripples touched off by the storms could have a cumulative effect, and the impact on the state's economy could be as much as $40 billion, economists said. HURRICANE FRANCES: THE OVERVIEW"
"As Hurricane Frances lumbered across Florida on Sunday, economic analysts estimated the costs of the damage inflicted by the sprawling storm and Hurricane Charley three weeks ago could run to $40 billion. That would be a greater economic blow to Florida than any hurricane disaster the state has previously endured. ''It's a one-two punch,'' said J. Antonio Villamil, the chairman of Gov. Jeb Bush's economic council. ''There is no question, this will have a significant impact on the state.'' Damage from Hurricane Frances will accentuate an economic slowdown begun by the earlier storm, particularly hurting the state's two main businesses, tourism and farming. But Mr. Villamil said federal assistance and insurance money, already flowing since Hurricane Charley, would be stepped up because of the second storm, and he forecast a return to strong growth for Florida by the end of the year. ''We'll stagger a bit, but then we'll be back,'' he said. In an election year in a pivotal state in which the governor is a brother of the president, independent economists expect especially strong economic support to flow from Washington. Mr. Villamil said he also expected extra federal help for the state. But, as he sees it, that will be mainly because of its closer coordination with Washington since Hurricane Andrew hit the state in 1992. With the onset of Hurricane Frances, President Bush declared all of Florida a disaster area, immediately expanding opportunities for federal assistance to the state. In response to Hurricane Charley, the president designated 21 of the state's 67 counties as eligible for federal disaster assistance. Almost immediately after the first hurricane, the Bush administration announced it was sending Florida $50 million to assist those who lost jobs because of the storm. The Department of Agriculture quickly estimated losses of at least $150 million for Florida's citrus crop, and state officials said they expected federal farm assistance to cover most of that loss. Until Hurricanes Frances and Charley, Hurricane Andrew was the state's worst hurricane disaster, causing $35 billion in damage in today's dollars. Sunday afternoon, Air Worldwide, a Boston company that assesses disaster damage for the insurance industry, estimated losses from Hurricane Frances could cost about $20 billion. As Hurricane Charley hit in August, the company estimated the storm would inflict similar losses. ''Combined, the losses from these two storms are likely to be bigger than from Andrew,'' said Karen Clark, the chief executive of Air Worldwide. ''This is more than the state has ever had to deal with at any one time.'' Ms. Clark said that while Hurricane Charley was a more powerful storm, with winds of 145 miles an hour as it struck Florida's Gulf Coast, Hurricane Frances would probably be just as damaging even with wind speeds of only about 105 m.p.h. The reason, she said, was that the hurricane-force winds this weekend stretched across a 170-mile-wide band, making it more than three times larger than Hurricane Charley. Equally significant, she said, Hurricane Frances was crawling across the state at an average speed of perhaps 7 miles an hour, grinding away at property for hours. By contrast, Hurricane Charley zipped along at an average of 25 m.p.h. ''You won't see any areas like Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte with complete devastation because the winds of Frances were weaker,'' she said. ''But Frances is more spread out and pounding away much longer.'' Of the total estimated losses of up to $20 billion, Ms. Clark estimated that $5 billion to $10 billion would be covered by insurance. Other analysts are estimating losses covered by insurance as low as $2 billion and as high as $10 billion. Industry estimates put the losses covered by insurance in Hurricane Charley around $7 billion. Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said Hurricane Frances ''probably caused more overall damage'' than Hurricane Charley. Mr. Hartwig said the evacuation of more than several million people from Florida's east coast would add considerably to the costs of the storm, particularly to tourism. ''From Miami to Jacksonville you had hotels empty, restaurants empty,'' he said. ''This was over an extended period of time because the storm moved so slowly. And it was over a holiday weekend. The hurricane is going to have a very substantial economic impact on those coastal areas.'' In Hurricane Andrew in 1992, insurance covered $15.5 billion of the losses, which at the time were estimated at $25 billion. Half a dozen small insurance companies collapsed then, and it took years for some of the insurance giants to recover. Since Hurricane Andrew, insurance coverage for hurricanes has been shrinking, shifting more of the burden to home owners and business people. As one measure, the insurance companies put into effect higher deductibles for hurricane damage. In place of the standard $500 deductible, the hurricane deductible becomes a percentage of the value of a property. With a widely used 2 percent deductible, the owner of a $100,000 home pays the first $2,000 in losses rather than $500. In areas the insurers regard as most threatened by hurricanes, like Miami and Fort Lauderdale, they refuse to sell hurricane coverage at all. In those areas, limited coverage is offered by a state agency. Losses to the insurance industry are further buffered by a state catastrophe fund that pays 90 percent of the losses above $4.5 billion. For Hurricane Charley, the fund is expected to pay about $2.25 billion; for Hurricane Frances the payment from the fund could be several billion dollars. Insurance analysts have said in the last few days that it was not clear whether the losses from the two storms would lead to an increase in property insurance premiums. Besides the immediate costs in the disruption of tourism and the prospect that future vacationers may be scared off -- both repeats of the consequences of Hurricane Charley -- the latest hurricane ripped through a part of the state's citrus groves in the vicinity of Fort Pierce that was untouched three weeks ago. Hurricane Frances also battered sugar cane fields near West Palm Beach. Mr. Villamil said the growth of Florida's $500 billion economy would probably slow to about 4 percent on an annualized basis for the three months ending in September, down from 4.8 percent in the previous three months. He said unemployment because of the two hurricanes would probably rise to 4.8 percent or 5 percent from 4.4 percent in July. In turn, he said, ''you are going to see some of the national numbers come in weaker.'' Mr. Villamil estimated about 10,000 Floridians lost their jobs as a result of Hurricane Charley, and he said about the same number could be expected from the latest hurricane. ''The increase over the short term will be about 20,000,'' he said. Mr. Villamil said he would recommend that the state dip into its own funds to stimulate the economy along with the federal aid and insurance money. Florida's economy surged after Hurricane Andrew, and Mr. Villamil said that within months he expected a similar sharp lift. ''By the end of the year we're going to be back to a very strong growth rate in the 5 percent to 5.5 percent range,'' he said. ''These jolts are just temporary.'' HURRICANE FRANCES: THE DAMAGE"
"For those of us in the Southeast, hurricane season is a frightening time. For the fortunate, it may mean only close calls or near misses -- of fallen limbs or sudden changes in the storm path. But the storm now eyeing Florida with evil intent -- Hurricane Frances -- is also a linguistic near-miss: change that ''e'' to an ''i,'' and you've got a hurricane bearing the name of the man who is responsible for naming the wind. Allow me to explain. The practice of naming hurricanes is a lot younger than one might think, though the practice of naming the wind is venerable. More important, there's a man named Francis at the core, which is why I so regret that feminizing ''e'' in the current Frances. Start with that hurricane in ''Key Largo.'' It's the one that atmospherically pummeled south Florida while Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall tried to neutralize the more-localized threat represented by Edward G. Robinson. Remember the name of that storm? Didn't think so -- you can't. ''Key Largo,'' released in 1948, predates the formal custom of naming storms, a practice that began in 1950. Until then, most storms were known by latitude and longitude, which necessitated frequent changes, to say nothing of repetitive and probably tiresome conversation among meteorologists. The informal custom of naming storms after women seems to have begun in 1941, with the publication of George Stewart's classic novel ''Storm.'' (Of course, truly unforgettable storms had earned nicknames before then; for example, the storm that leveled much of coastal New England in 1938 became known as the Long Island Express.) In ''Storm,'' a character identified only as the Junior Meteorologist privately refers to storms by names: ''He justified the sentimental vagary by explaining mentally that each storm was really an individual and that he could more easily say (to himself, of course) 'Antonia' than 'the low-pressure center which was yesterday in Latitude 175 east, Longitude 42 north.''' The Junior Meteorologist called the book's titular storm ''Maria.'' (And yes, that was the inspiration for the song.) By 1950, meteorologists were using names from the military's ''Able-Baker-Charlie'' phonetic alphabet. But when a new phonetic alphabet with words that were easier to pronounce in foreign languages was introduced internationally, the competing alphabets confused matters even more. So in 1953, meteorologists decided to identify storms with women's names that were short and easy to pronounce. In 1979, after critics pointed out that the practice of using only female names was at best unkind, things changed. Now we have Arthurs to go with our Berthas. Today, lists of alternating masculine and feminine names are put in a six-year rotation; the names are reused unless their storms reach Category 3, at which point they are out of circulation for at least 10 years. Hazel, the name of the monster that ripped through the Carolinas in 1954, was the first to be retired. But naming the wind is hardly a new concept. The wind had names, in fact, before we had a real scientific understanding of what wind is. Homer named four winds in ''The Odyssey,'' and the Tower of the Winds built in ancient Athens named eight, Boreas and Zephyr among them, each with its own personality. But for settling a name onto the wind, the world's great champion is Sir Francis Beaufort, the 19th-century British admiral whose eponymous scale ranks winds from ''calm'' to ''hurricane,'' through such intermediate steps as ''gentle breeze'' and ''fresh gale.'' You'll know you're in a Force 2 ''light breeze,'' for example, if the wind is ''felt on face; leaves rustle; ordinary vane moved by wind.'' By a fresh breeze, which is Force 5, ''small trees in leaf begin to sway; crested wavelets form on inland waters.'' If I point out that the first clause about the fresh breeze is iambic tetrameter and the second trochaic pentameter, you'll understand why I believe the Beaufort Scale represents one of the great found poems in the English language. Look at the vigor of its language and, as much as a poem, it's Strunk and White writ large -- or I suppose writ small. Sir Ian McKellen has been known to read the Beaufort Scale aloud onstage; it has been set to music in Finland, formed the core of a children's book in France. It's still in use by sailors worldwide, and every night listeners to BBC Radio 4 in England fall asleep listening to the shipping forecast, which combines Beaufort Scale numbers (''southwest 4, later 5'') with names for different areas of the sea (Tyne; Wight; Dover) into a sonorous 10-minute string of nouns and numbers beloved as the great Zen poem of a nation of sea lovers. We have specific names for the winds, beginning with the gentle breezes and light airs we face daily, because of Sir Francis Beaufort. They call the wind Maria, as we all know; but it is also fitting, as we do this week, to call it Frances. Op-Ed Contributor Scott Huler is the author of ''Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th-Century Admiral Turned Science into Poetry.''"
"Hurricane Frances engulfed the Bahamas on Friday, leaving at least one person dead before moving, ever more slowly, toward an anxious Florida, where 2.5 million people -- nearly 15 percent of the state's population -- have been urged to evacuate their homes. Anticipation of the hurricane's Texas-scale breadth and ferocious winds have emptied out much of the state's central and southern coasts, from West Palm Beach north to Daytona Beach, as state landmarks like the Kennedy Space Center and Walt Disney World shut down and cleared out customers and employees. The Florida state meteorologist, Ben Nelson, said that as of late Friday the storm was expected to make landfall early Saturday, most likely between West Palm Beach and Fort Pierce. At about five times the width and one-third the speed of Hurricane Charley, the new storm by Friday evening recorded winds at 105 m.p.h., which put it in Category 2 of the five-point system of measuring hurricanes. Such a storm could cause flooding extensive enough to evoke memories of the hurricane of 1928, a storm legendary in the state for breaking a levee on Lake Okeechobee and causing as many as 2,500 deaths. ''This storm is bringing us everything,'' said Craig Fugate, the director of Florida Division of Emergency Management. ''It's going to bring storm surge, hurricane-force winds for a sustained period of time, torrential rainfall. It's going to bring tornados.'' At 11 p.m. Friday, the National Hurricane Center reported a hurricane warning from Florida City north to Flagler Beach. Mr. Nelson estimated that 10 to 15 inches of rain would fall over a 60-mile-wide swath around the eye of the storm, and officials said that was enough to lead to urban flooding and failure of smaller nongovernment dams. A spokesman for the South Florida Water Management Agency said that all 127 pumps and gates in the system of lakes and canals that stretches north past Lake Apopka has been operating for the last four days to move out the rain from the last hurricane, which had left many lakes close to overflowing, though not Lake Okeechobee. The top of the 30-foot Herbert Hoover Dike, built a year after the devastating hurricane, is at least 16 feet above the current water level, the spokesman, Roberto Fabricio, said. Orlando International Airport closed at noon on Friday. Patrick Air Force Base was evacuated, and its 10,000 troops and civilians in their sports utility vehicles headed for MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, joining the westward flow of humanity and the hunt for gasoline, which sporadically disappeared from service stations along their route. Several prisons were also evacuated, with more than 3,400 inmates transferred to safer institutions. And flood warnings were posted for virtually all of the Florida Peninsula. The storm had slow-crawled its way northwesterly through the core of the 700 islands of the Bahamas since grazing over the adjacent Turks and Caicos Islands, where it first made landfall on Wednesday. The hurricane slowed to 8 m.p.h. to 9 m.p.h. at some points in the Bahamas, in contrast to the pace of Hurricane Charley, which whipped through central Florida three weeks ago at speeds of up to 30 m.p.h. Hurricane Frances lingered over New Providence Island, where Nassau is, and some of the other islands for nearly 24 hours. But instead of flattening the islands with its winds of more than 140 m.p.h., the hurricane wobbled past them, delivering only glancing blows. In Nassau, for example, sustained winds averaged 60 m.p.h. with gusts of 90 to 100 m.p.h., said Michael Stubbs, the government's chief climatologist. Chief Superintendent Hulan Hanna of the Royal Bahamas Police Force said that Kenrad Delancy, 18, apparently was electrocuted while working outside in the storm on a power generator for his family's home in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, shortly after dawn on Friday. The police also reported several cases of looting in Nassau on Friday morning. As the hurricane moved into the northernmost islands of the Bahamas and closer to the coast of Florida late Friday, the Bahamian authorities said that, surprisingly, the powerful, sprawling storm appeared to have caused no major concentrations of damage. Still, Air Worldwide, a Boston firm that assesses losses for the insurance industry, estimated late Friday that rebuilding costs could run to $100 million. ''There are a lot of relatively small losses, but they add up to a significant number,'' said Karen Clark, the chief executive of Air Worldwide. John Darrell Rood, who became United States ambassador here this week, said that American aid officials were helping to assess the losses and that the United States was ready to provide assistance if needed. Bahamian officials said they worried that with Hurricane Frances appearing to head directly toward the northern islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama and its principal town, Freeport, a gambling and beach resort with heavy cruise ship traffic, they could be in for worse losses. Ms. Clark said heavy damage in Grand Bahama could add tens of millions of dollars to reconstruction costs. Residents of other islands speaking on radio talk shows and Bahamian authorities in Nassau reported damage throughout the islands to roofs and said that many roads had been blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Chief Superintendent Hanna estimated that electricity was knocked out in roughly 60 percent of the Bahamas. Preparing for Hurricane Frances, said one caller to Bud Hedinger's radio talk show on WFLA-AM in Orlando, ''is a little harder'' than waiting for Hurricane Charley, because the memory of that storm is so fresh. ''You had to listen to the howling, the breaking stuff for two hours, and now it's going to last a whole day.'' In Florida, 20,600 people had taken refuge in 209 shelters by the end of the day, as others sweated in the 90-degree heat, first driving around to find the plywood and fasteners and sandbags to protect their homes and then to install them. At the same time, the outer fringes of Hurricane Frances began to toss sand about on central Florida beaches and hint at the waves and winds to come. At the Causeway mobile home park, between Fort Pierce and South Hutchinson Island, a resident, Gary Peckham packed his two guitars and the shell mobiles that he makes into his 1987 Dodge Reliant K. He left behind his Roy Orbison sheet music. He said he bought the 30-foot trailer for $500 four years ago. ''I don't think it's going to be here'' after the storm, he said. Curfews, which began at 8 p.m., formally cleared roads in St. Lucie and Indian River Counties. Police refused to allow people on barrier islands. A mixture of anxiety and exasperation greeted the continually adjusted reports of the storm's progress. Dwight Bain, the director of counseling at the LifeWorks Group in Orlando and an expert on storm-related trauma, said Friday, ''This storm's effects are more than any crisis I've dealt with. Because it's so slow, the psychological storm surge is more intense. People have been prepared for this major, terrible, monster hurricane for the past 48 hours, and we've still got another 24 hours before it starts.'' The likelihood that many people would face a 24-hour pounding without electricity or utilities will just intensify the trauma, Mr. Bain said."
"Hurricane Frances was out there, somewhere, but more mystery at the moment than menace in the mind of Christine Weslowski as she leaned into the big warm breeze blowing hard across the boardwalk here. ''Isn't this great?'' she said Thursday evening, a sunny pink shine on her widow's peaks as the wind blew back her hair. ''Where else could you experience something like this?'' Divorced and unemployed, Ms. Weslowski, 53, was just down from up north in full pursuit of a new life. A dreamer. Yet another. From Hurricane Andrew to Hurricane Charley to whatever deadly storm is named next; from the culture-clash cyclone of Elián Gonzalez, the Cuban castaway; to the political tornado that was the 2000 election recount -- no calamity seems antidote enough to cure the enduring international addiction to Florida. From Ponce de Leon to P. Diddy, they keep coming, and fast, to what Gov. Jeb Bush insists, in between emergency news conferences, is still America's ''paradise.'' From 1990 to 2000, much of which the state spent recovering from Hurricane Andrew, Florida's population soared by 24 percent to 16 million. Now it is past 17 million. The state is under constant construction, with huge housing tracts and high rises pushing north on the east coast past Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties through Martin and St. Lucie -- places that a decade ago were filled with farmland rather than young families and old folks. Damage costs from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 were estimated at $27 billion, those from Hurricane Charley last month at least $7 billion. But few people with real influence seem interested in stopping the boom that, aside from increasing traffic congestion, threatening the fragile environment and stressing the fresh water supply, will only increase the costs of rebuilding. ''We need to remind people,'' Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings said at a news conference Friday after the storm had toyed with the state's anxieties from offshore for two days, ''Florida is open for business.'' And in Indian River County, many Floridians seemed awfully open-minded about hurricanes -- particularly people who have never been hit by a big one. ''Oh, it's worth it,'' declared Michael Dunne, a New York native who with his wife, Cheryl, brought their children to the beach Thursday night to watch the waves even as officials had removed streetlights on Ocean Drive for fear of what the imminent winds might do. ''Why do people live in California?'' asked Mrs. Dunne, originally from New Jersey, countering the suggestion that maybe the state was not the safest haven for a young family. ''They have earthquakes that you have no way of knowing are coming.'' The Dunnes, who have lived in Florida 13 years, were packed and ready to evacuate. They said they had come to terms with the possibilities, including returning to find their house, a concrete-block structure west of the Indian River on the mainland, destroyed. ''I think it will probably shake me a little bit,'' said Mr. Dunne, 46. ''But I don't think it'll make me want to leave here.'' Then again, Indian River County has never experienced the kind of storm that it faces now. ''There has never been a hurricane over 100 miles per hour in the history of the town,'' Nathan McCollum, the county's emergency management coordinator, said Friday. Joe Miller, 64, said he had lived in the county all his life and not once felt threatened by a storm the way he did by Hurricane Frances. Late on Thursday, when the roads were dark and the stores were closed, Mr. Miller was making last-minute money mounting plywood over the windows of A-One Discount Beverages just off Highway 1. Wearing a sleeveless T-shirt that declared ''Richer is Better,'' Mr. Miller said a coastal resident told him earlier in the day of having made plans to fly out of state to avoid the storm. ''Isn't that great to have that kind of dinero?'' asked Mr. Miller, who lives in a mobile home far inland from the new developments that increasingly crowd Vero Beach's coast. ''To just do what you want to do, go where you want to go?'' In northern Indian River County, immaculate coastal developments like St. John's Island quickly give way to places like Wabasso, where wooden shacks sit on sandy roads rimmed by dense palmettos and, further out, citrus groves. Fruit packers and pickers and tractor drivers, mostly black, some from Haiti and the West Indies, have lived here for half a century. But their shacks have never really been tested. ''They're talking like it'll tear down everything and we'll just be lying here,'' said Ruby Mitchner, 74. The windows of her weathered pink frame house were partly covered with a mix of wood scraps. Then Dennis Richard, on his way back from boarding windows in Sebastian, pulled into Ms. Mitchner's driveway. ''Ma'am, I've got some cut-off wood,'' he told her. ''You want it? I was just going to throw it away.'' Mr. Richard, 32, said later, ''I just saw her. You've got to help people out.'' Ms. Mitchner said that Hurricane Frances was the first time a storm had really scared her and that she might head to a shelter on Saturday, depending on the forecast. She pointed up the road, toward Sebastian River High School, which has been converted into a shelter for people with special medical needs. Even at the shelter, there were signs of the state's gambler spirit. One man, Gordon Winagle, 74, had written a message on the board of the band room: ''Yesterday is a history day. Today is a gift day. Tomorrow is a mystery day.'' Doris Cotti, 81, sat knitting by her cot in the band room. ''This is my hurricane lap robe,'' she said. ''I've got enough yarn to make another one.'' In the next room, Mary Lou Volkman, 71, who lives in a waterfront development called Cache Cay, said she was just happy to find a safe place to stay for her and her husband Harvey, who was sifting through more than a dozen containers for pills for his heart condition. She said that they had moved down from Connecticut four years ago, and that they gave little thought at the time to hurricanes. ''I don't know,'' she said, ''we just always wanted to come to Florida.''"
"People in this Gulf Coast city emerged from their safe havens on Thursday to find their city battered, splintered and tossed about like so much toy furniture in the hands of a furious child. Concrete chunks of sidewalks were flicked into the street like plastic dominoes. Steel light stanchions were bent at right angles. Hulking air-conditioning units blew off the city's sports arena, and one of them landed in the front seat of a car three stories below. Roofs were pulled from homes like the perforated tops of cellophane bags. Across this entire city, and in much of Escambia County, it was rare to find a block where a tree or power line was not down, without a roof torn open or a backyard flooded. The damage was not always devastating, but it was everywhere. ''I didn't see any part of town that was worse than any other,'' said Peter Teahen, a spokesman for an American Red Cross team in town. ''It was bad everywhere.'' As the storm made land in Alabama, it veered east, delivering some of its worst destruction in hurricane-weary Florida. Time and again residents said Hurricane Ivan was the worst storm they had ever experienced. And yet, time and again, they also said it could have been worse. There were, for instance, the seven trees that fell around Cora Beavers's home, not one of which so much as scratched her red brick walls or tore a shingle from her roof. One uprooted oak tree was so large that it took with it a half-moon-shaped chunk of dirt and moss that was 10 feet tall. ''I'm so blessed,'' Ms. Beavers said, surveying the fallen trees that had ringed her home in the Perdido Manor section of town. There was also Phillip Walters's business, where the aluminum roof had shredded along one corner of the building. But none of his equipment for serving diesel fuel injectors was damaged, so he put out some buckets to catch the rainwater trickling in through the ceiling and called it a day. ''Tomorrow, we'll come in and start tearing off the roof,'' he said. ''It could have been worse.'' Earl Clark and his wife, Neva, spent the afternoon removing their daughter's valuables from her double-wide trailer, the roof of which had collapsed from the onslaught of rain and wind on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Both sides of the trailer had been pinched in as if by giant fingers, and the roof had been torn open on two sides, exposing a child's room in the corner. Somehow, despite the sustained winds of 130 miles an hour, a bed, a yellow plastic truck and other toys remained in place in what was left of the room. Yet the family had left before the storm, and all were safe. ''Gosh, they were lucky they didn't stay,'' Neva Clark, 60, said. ''All my daughter could say was, 'Mama, we lost it all.' But they could have lost their lives.'' Indeed, authorities said no one in Escambia County died as a result of the storm, although one person suffered a fatal heart attack that might have resulted from the stress of the hurricane, which pummeled the coast for more than 18 hours. Preliminary estimates of property damage were not available on Thursday afternoon. But officials said Pensacola appeared to have been hardest hit by the storm. The entire city was also without power, water or sewer service. Utility officials predicted that it could be weeks before all service was restored. Without power, no traffic lights worked. But there was plenty of traffic, despite a 24-hour curfew. At every major intersection, motorists felt their way cautiously, like hikers wading across fast-flowing rivers. Residents who had been hoping that the storm's wake would leave sunny weather behind were disappointed, as the sky taunted them with intermittent rain and gusting winds throughout the afternoon. The bridges connecting the county's barrier islands remained closed to traffic, as officials inspected them for possible storm damage. That left hundreds and possibly thousands of residents in some of the worst-hit areas unable to return to their homes, or get away from them. Part of old Pensacola's historic Seville section near the waterfront was flooded, including a public park and a new development. Chip Sloan owns an antique shop in the flooded area. When he could no longer drive through the hip-deep water to reach his store, he decided to kayak in. At least two old brick buildings in the older section of town were destroyed by the high winds. One was little more than a pile of bricks scattered into the street. The winds also knocked down trees, fences and century-old tombstones in the city's historic cemetery. Along the waterfront, a large sailboat had been washed up next to the road. Gas stations and auto dealers seemed particularly vulnerable, their aluminum awnings torn and twisted like crepe paper. At many intersections, smashed traffic lights swung low into the streets, forcing cars to swerve. The storm's powerful winds were nothing if not capricious in their destruction. A row of pine trees near the naval hospital were snapped in half, while a block away, a stand of trees looked untouched. The roof of a restaurant on Navy Boulevard was ripped completely off, while two fast-food outlets nearby looked intact. HURRICANE IVAN: THE SCENE"
"The battering that the hurricanes of the last month has inflicted on NASA centers could strain an already tight schedule for resuming shuttle flights, but it is too early to tell how badly, experts said Thursday. The Kennedy Space Center in Florida suffered widespread damage from Hurricanes Charley and Frances in mid-August and over the Labor Day weekend. And the approach of Hurricane Ivan forced a temporary closing of the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the shuttle's external fuel tanks are made. Thomas P. Stafford and Richard O. Covey, former astronauts who are chairmen of a task force overseeing the space agency's return to shuttle flight activities, said it could be several weeks before the program managers determined the effect of the hurricane season on plans to resume flights next March or April. They said the disruptions had cost NASA at least a week, possibly more if the storms are found to have damaged critical systems. NASA said in a statement issued Thursday that its damage assessment teams had completed initial inspections at the Kennedy center. They have found significant damage to the giant Vehicle Assembly Building, where shuttles are prepared for flight; to the building where the tiles that protect the shuttles against heat are made; and to at least a half-dozen other structures, and are taking a closer look at 900 additional buildings and structures at the base."
"Ending its ominous, slow waltz through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ivan thrashed the Gulf Coast from midnight to sunrise Thursday. Along the way, it carved a path of destruction through the Southeast with winds reaching 130 miles an hour and even more powerful tornadoes, killing at least 23 people, inundating homes and cutting off highways, including Interstate 10 in Mobile and Pensacola. The eye made landfall over the small Alabama city of Gulf Shores abut 2:30 a.m., and the hurricane left some of the worst damage in Pensacola and the rest of the Florida Panhandle, which were hit by the storm's powerful northeast quadrant. Tornadoes produced by the hurricane killed four people in Blountstown, Fla., northeast of Panama City. In Bay County, a 77-year-old woman was found dead 75 yards from her bayfront home in a pile of debris and an 84-year-old man was found dead of head injuries after a tornado sliced the roof off the building he was visiting to check on his daughter's business. Hurricane Ivan was the third hurricane in a month to scar Florida's landscape and kill its residents. Pensacola joined the Florida cities West Palm Beach and Punta Gorda as synonymous with a litany of hardship including wrecked homes, scrambled marinas and uprooted trees. Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida called the damage ''heartbreaking,'' adding, ''The larger Pensacola area appears to have experienced the brunt of the storm.'' The storm surge that had pumped waves to 55-foot heights in the Gulf of Mexico sent floodwaters into communities south and east of Mobile. In southern Louisiana, the swampy parish of St. Bernard, on the toe of the boot-shaped state, was partly flooded. Across the Gulf Coast, as many as five million people were without power as the winds slowly subsided. In Gulf Shores, on the eastern side of Mobile Bay, water lapped through washed-out shops and homes, branches were ripped from sodden tree trunks, and wild animals ran free from the local zoo. Water swamped the Down Under dive shop, lapping above the level of the plywood boards hammered into place to protect the building. White-capped waves crested in the parking lot of Souvenir City. One resident, Steve Horvat, joked that he now had beachfront property. ''The problem is some people say it looks like a houseboat,'' he said. President Bush declared a state of emergency Thursday in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana and was expected to add Florida to the group once the requisite paperwork was filed. Hurricane Ivan killed 70 people in the Caribbean, where it reached Category 5 strength, the most intense. As it neared the coast, approaching directly from the south, the storm took an eastward jog, delivering a ferocious blow to Alabama and Florida but only grazing the Mississippi shore, whose high-rise casinos had closed in expectation of danger. The Grand Casino in Biloxi left behind a flashing sign reading, ''All bets off till Ivan folds.'' After New Orleans residents evacuated en masse and the city imposed an uncharacteristic (and lightly enforced) 2 p.m. curfew on Wednesday, the storm did little more than whip up waves over the concrete banks of Lake Pontchartrain's south shore, to the awe and delight of nearby residents who frolicked in the overflow. After the eye reached land as a Category 3 storm and pivoting to the northeast, the storm quickly lost much of its power but pushed bands of drenching rainstorms into Georgia and the Carolinas, knocking out power as far away as the suburbs of Atlanta. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for as far away as North Carolina, which suffered heavy flooding last week from the remnants of Hurricane Frances. The Carolinas and Georgia could be in for more trouble next week from Tropical Storm Jeanne, which reached the Dominican Republic Thursday afternoon. The signs of Hurricane Ivan's passage northward along Interstate 65 toward Montgomery, Ala., were the absence, in places, of the usual green-and-white exit markers, which had been punched over and lay nearly invisible in the wet grass. Roads around Mobile were a maze of downed pines and oak limbs, drooping power lines, and splintered telephone poles that prompted some drivers to improvise routes. Mobile County sheriff's deputies drove out the long road and causeway toward Dauphin Island, a heavily developed spit of barrier beach, to find the permeating smell of leaking gas and a dozen or fewer residents who stayed for the storm, perversely proud of their defiance of nature and government evacuation orders. The road to the island was studded with stones ranging from cantaloupe to watermelon size. Dunes of oyster shells and weeds and driftwood expelled by the bay blocked the route. The officers had to skirt a spot where two-thirds of the pavement on one side had been chewed away. And a scattering of exhausted pelicans, which had sheltered from the storm behind roadside concrete barriers, slouched down against the persistent gusts in the middle of the roadway, folding their heads and long beaks back amid their plumage, like the closed blade of a pocket knife. Some had died. About 400 troops from the National Guard were being deployed, with about 70 of them sent to Gulf Shores. Early Thursday morning the police were the only people out in Gulf Shores as water ran about three-quarters of a mile up the island from the beach. Sgt. Dennis King remained on the island with a skeleton crew of officers. ''It was eerie when the eye of the storm went over,'' he said. ''You could go out and look up and see the stars.'' He said the perimeter fence of the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo had broken and some animals had escaped. ''Look around every now and then and you will see a deer from the zoo,'' Sergeant King said. ''We don't know if the snakes and such are still in their cages.'' By 8 p.m. Thursday, most of Baldwin County's 140,000 residents still lacked power, said Leigh Anne Ryals, director of the Baldwin County Emergency Management Agency. ''It may be up to two weeks before the power is back,'' Ms. Ryals said. The authorities finally managed to account for all 15 families who weathered the hurricane in an upscale housing development on Ono Island, she said. ''Everyone has come through just fine,'' Ms. Ryals said. ''We are now trying to keep people out of the county while we get the damage assessment under way.'' But it was in storm-weary Florida that some of the greatest devastation could be seen. Parts of Pensacola were literally torn apart, with one home in the Old East Hill district reduced to rubble, around which curious neighbors gathered Thursday afternoon, shaking their heads. In one flooded street, an abandoned car stood with water up to its windows. Wind and water damage was extensive in Pensacola, where many streets were blocked by downed trees, roof after roof was de-shingled or partly ripped off, and power lines dangled from collapsed or crazily canted poles. Floodwaters rippled through part of downtown. About 1,700 people hunkered down overnight at the Pensacola Civic Center, which was converted into a Red Cross shelter, The Associated Press reported. But evacuees had to be moved from floor to floor as water seeped through the walls, partly flooding the arena and third floor of the five-story building. ''This building was rocking and rolling all night long,'' Sandie Aaron, manager of the business that operates the building, told The A.P. ''We kept thinking, 'A couple more hours, a couple more hours.' I was never so glad to see the sun come up today -- or at least daylight.'' Rick Outzen, 47, a resident and city councilman in the nearby city of Gulf Breeze, Fla., said the Gulf Breeze landing of the Bob Sikes Bridge to Pensacola Beach had been washed away, closing the only direct route to the barrier island. He also said one wall of an AmSouth Bank in Gulf Breeze had been ripped off. ''I don't know how long it is going to take us to get up and going,'' Mr. Outzen said. ''This is worse than what I had hoped for.'' In New Orleans, where more than 1,000 city residents, many of them elderly, took shelter in the Superdome, less than an inch of rain fell. Wind gusts touched 40 m.p.h., and the flooding at the edge of Lake Pontchartrain did little more than lap at the bottom of the set-back levee. Kelly Andras, 26, said it was ''a whole lot better'' than she had expected when she evacuated her home a mile from the lake. She added, ''I thought I wasn't going to come home to a home, so this is great.'' Along U.S. 90 in Mississippi the visible damage was light, but not far beyond the Alabama border, the evidence of destruction mounted: downed traffic lights, trees lying across roofs, an abandoned truck up to its axle in water at the roadside. In Gulf Shores, the beachfront Crown Pointe condominiums had an ocean-facing wall stripped off, dollhouse-style, to reveal a bedroom with a made bed, several fully fitted kitchens and a dining rooms that somehow still had four chairs upright around a table. Another condominium had been reduced to a low pile of broken sticks while the concrete base of another was rumpled like cardboard. HURRICANE IVAN: THE OVERVIEW"
"Pollsters in this crucial swing state were forced to twiddle their thumbs for six weeks. Fund-raisers did not dare seek donations, and campaign volunteers found themselves clearing debris from neighborhoods they had hoped to canvass on behalf of Senator John Kerry or President Bush. Three back-to-back hurricanes have crippled the campaign season in Florida, and political candidates are only now starting to make up for precious lost time in a state whose residents may be too storm-fatigued to notice. With a fourth hurricane looming just offshore, lawmakers and political operatives are gasping at the irony that Florida, which scrupulously prepared for November to make up for its gaffes in 2000, is mired in chaos nonetheless. ''It's been rather dramatic,'' said Allan Oliver of the League of Conservation Voters, which hopes to canvass 250,000 Florida homes before the election but suspended operations after Hurricane Charley blew the roof off its building in Orlando. ''We now have a much tighter window and a much bigger challenge.'' Mr. Oliver's group and others quit knocking on doors after Hurricane Charley hit on Aug. 13, and Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry stopped making campaign appearances here, though Mr. Bush briefly visited the three regions that were hit hardest by the storms. While the president and his brother Gov. Jeb Bush passed out supplies and soothed victims, Mr. Kerry -- whose Florida headquarters in Fort Lauderdale was evacuated for Hurricane Frances -- stayed away except for a short trip to the area pummeled by Hurricane Charley. He and his running mate, Senator John Edwards, finally returned to Florida this week, doling out sympathy for residents while gingerly trying to refocus them on politics. Many strategists predict that President Bush's presence after each hurricane, and the swift arrival of federal emergency workers and aid, will help his chances in Florida, where he defeated Al Gore by just 537 votes in 2000. Almost all assume that Mr. Kerry's long absence here will hurt him. But some experts theorize that the storms could work against Mr. Bush, either because some voters will grow frustrated with the pace or amount of federal disaster aid, or because Hurricane Frances distracted people at the very time that Mr. Bush was basking in the glow of the Republican National Convention. ''My sense is things are pretty much exactly where they were right before the conventions, which is more or less even,'' said Jim Kane, chief pollster for Florida Voter, a nonpartisan polling organization. ''Within two weeks we could be back to normal again, but it's all dependent on what happens out in the Atlantic.'' Though polls have started trickling out again in recent days, the absence of any here since early August has been the biggest handicap for political candidates, who base decisions about advertising and the image they project on polling data. Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, a nonpartisan group that conducts polls in Florida, said all of his projects were on hold until at least next week. The inability to get accurate results in areas like Pensacola, where tens of thousands of people still lack phone service and power after Hurricane Ivan, would skew numbers, he said. The Panhandle is solidly Republican, as is the slice of southwestern Florida where Hurricane Charley made landfall in August. Palm Beach County, the largest county affected by Hurricane Frances, is heavily Democratic, while Orlando and the inland communities that Hurricane Charley ravaged are swing-vote territory. ''I would defy anyone to show me a two- or three-day window where they could have done a poll that wouldn't be screwed up by fact that people are without phones or living in hotels up in Georgia,'' Mr. Coker said. ''Even once you've got power back, you've still got a couple of days cleaning up the mess, and psychologically you just don't want to be bothered by telephone calls from strangers.'' He should know -- he said he was less than pleased to get a telemarketing call from a termite-removal company the day after his power was restored after Hurricane Frances. Representative Mark Foley, a Palm Beach County Republican whose district was slammed by the first two storms, said the lack of polling data had federal, state and local candidates ''flying blind'' at a pivotal time. In particular, it is impossible to determine the impact of television advertising, he said. ''If you can't gauge reaction, you can't say, 'Let's pull this health-care ad and go for an economy ad,''' Mr. Foley said. ''You're doing a social science experiment without data, and that's very dangerous for any of us because you need to test reaction in a state like this.'' Several candidates, including Mr. Foley, said they did not run advertisements right after the storms because viewers might be offended and, with widespread power outages, the commercials might not be seen. The storms have particularly hurt the campaigns of Mel Martinez and Betty Castor, the Republican and Democratic candidates for Senate. While Florida newspapers and television stations have covered the presidential race along with the storms, the Senate candidates have had a much harder time getting coverage and therefore raising money, several strategists said. Their campaigns did not begin in earnest until Sept. 1, the day after the Senate primary, and they have canceled numerous appearances and fund-raisers since then. Ms. Castor, who finally began advertising again last week, appealed for donations in a recent e-mail message that said the hurricanes had ''severely stalled'' her campaign. ''Power outages across the state have caused the cancellation of essential television advertising,'' she wrote. ''These ads have been delayed. And you can understand how difficult it is to ask people for campaign donations during the cleanup from a major natural disaster.'' Equally hamstrung are the independent advocacy groups known as 527's (for the section of tax law that created them), many of which had set up shop in Florida for get-out-the-vote efforts and advertising, mostly on behalf of Democrats. One of the largest such groups, America Coming Together, stopped canvassing in Tampa and Orlando for more than two weeks. During that time, its staff members volunteered for the Red Cross and picked up debris in African-American neighborhoods, said Tait Sye, a spokesman. Mr. Oliver said his group, the League of Conservation Voters, dispatched most of its staff to recruit more volunteers in Texas, Georgia and Washington after Hurricane Charley damaged its office. ''We did a few test canvasses but found that people were, for very good reasons, not focused on the election,'' he said. ''We only started up again Saturday, and we're still bringing out disaster information to folks as we canvass. We are trying to be as respectful as we can at the door.'' Notwithstanding the threat of Hurricane Jeanne, the campaigns and the organizations that support them see a potential saving grace: the first presidential debate, scheduled for Thursday at the University of Miami, which they hope will refocus Floridians on the election. And even though it remains difficult to poll voters in the Pensacola region, several groups released statewide surveys this week that might light fires under the campaigns. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Thursday gave Mr. Bush a 49 percent to 46 percent lead over Mr. Kerry among likely voters in Florida. There is also the question of whether Florida's frazzled voters will meet the registration deadline of Oct. 4, and whether their polling places are still standing. Doug Wilkes, supervisor of elections in Santa Rosa County, which Hurricane Ivan battered, said that one polling place was ''gone'' and that others would need to be relocated. Mr. Wilkes said he met last week's deadline for sending out overseas ballots only by driving to Alabama to pick up the ballots from the printer, stuff envelopes in a hotel room and mail them from there. Pat Hollarn, the elections supervisor in neighboring Okaloosa County, said she was struggling to process a storm-inflicted backlog of 4,000 registration applications. Up to nine of the county's polling places might have been be badly damaged, she said. As a hurricane warning was posted for Florida's entire eastern seaboard Friday for Hurricane Jeanne and Governor Bush declared the fourth state of emergency of the season, the Kerry campaign quietly scrapped plans for Mr. Edwards to visit on Sunday, though Matthew Miller, a spokesman, played down the significance of the cancellation. ''It's a campaign,'' he said. ''Our plans change. Especially in this state.'' Correction: September 28, 2004, Tuesday A front-page article on Saturday about the effects of the hurricanes on campaigning in Florida used a misspelled given name in some copies for the director of the Florida League of Conservation Voters, who said the organization faced a big challenge after having suspended operations because of Hurricane Charley. He is Allan Oliver, not Alan. A picture caption gave a misspelled surname in some copies for a league member who visited two women in their damaged home in Orlando. He was Jourdan Haynes, not Hayes."
"Packing winds up to 150 miles an hour, Hurricane Ivan, the third powerful storm to boil up out of the Atlantic this year, bore down on Jamaica on Thursday evening after devastating Grenada. The authorities began evacuating the Florida Keys in anticipation of being hammered this weekend. Hurricane Ivan killed at least 23 people on Grenada on Wednesday as it ripped through the southern Caribbean, wrecking thousands of houses, including Prime Minister Keith Mitchell's official residence, and breaking open a centuries-old prison, freeing inmates. The storm clipped the northern coast of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago, killing at least two other people. Here in the capital of Jamaica, a tourist island of 2.7 million people that appeared to be directly in the path of the storm, schools closed, businesses and government offices began shutting at noon, and people along the coasts, many in lightly built houses, were encouraged to move to higher ground. With a direct hit on Jamaica increasingly inevitable, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson urged residents to secure their houses and pray. ''We can avert unnecessary tragedy and minimize damage if we act sensibly,'' Mr. Patterson said in a broadcast address. ''The forces of nature can change in a short time, but we have constantly to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.'' In Florida, where residents continued to clean up from Hurricanes Charley and Frances, Gov. Jeb Bush told reporters that bracing for a third storm in less than a month seemed surreal. ''Maybe someone in Hollywood could come up with something like this,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But this is past my imagination.'' Forecasters expected Hurricane Ivan to hit Jamaica early Friday and move on to Cuba and arrive in the Florida Keys as early as Sunday morning. It strengthened after hitting Grenada with winds of 145 m.p.h., with winds reaching 160 m.p.h. before slowing down to a maximum of 150 m.p.h. later Thursday. In Florida, Monroe County officials ordered tourists to leave the Keys on Thursday morning and told residents of mobile homes that they should head out of the region by nightfall. The authorities said the mandatory removal of the rest of the 79,000 residents would probably begin early Friday. The little airport in Key West was packed on Thursday, and northbound traffic grew heavy on the mostly two-lane Overseas Highway, the sole overland link between the Keys and the mainland. At the Best Western Key Ambassador Resort Inn in Key West, the general manager, Armida Averette, said the 22 guests in her 100-room hotel did not have to be told twice to leave. ''When Hurricane Charley was coming,'' Ms. Averette said, ''the guests didn't want to leave. But this time we had no resistance.'' Grenada is a small vacation island that grows spices and bananas and was invaded in 1983, when President Ronald Reagan sent American troops after fighting broke out among factions of the leftist government. Island residents were stunned by the latest hurricane. ''We have really taken a tremendous hit in every respect,'' Prime Minister Mitchell said in a telephone interview with BBC Radio. ''You are talking hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.'' In the fighting before the invasion, Maurice Bishop, who had earlier seized power in what he called a revolution, was killed along with associates. Later, the people accused of the killings were tried and given long prison sentences. They were among the prisoners who escaped on Wednesday as the hurricane pummeled the island. By some estimates, up to 90 percent of the homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. ''Almost all of the island is wrecked,'' Terry Ally, a spokesman for the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency, said in an interview with Agence France-Presse. Mr. Mitchell took refuge on a British frigate, the Richmond. Crew members from the Richmond and another nearby British vessel went ashore to help with rescues. Jamaica has not been hit by a major storm since 1988, when Hurricane Gilbert inflicted heavy damage. That storm was a much less powerful hurricane, rated in Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At some points, meteorologists have classified Hurricane Ivan in Category 5, with winds of up to 160 m.p.h. Late Thursday afternoon, with bright sun shining through big clumps of fluffy gray clouds that hung still in the sky, fears grew that Jamaica was about to experience its worst hurricane ever. ''We're nervous,'' said Marjorie Pottinger, who runs a snack shop in a rickety little wood and tin building that sits on blocks at the edge of a beach near the Port of Kingston. ''It makes me feel shaky.'' The Save More Super Center grocery store was jammed with people who were stocking up on canned food, bottled water and flashlight batteries. ''It looks like it's going to be bad,'' Anthony Beckford, a locksmith, said as he wrapped his arms around two big bags of food and a carton of water bottles. Like many other shoppers, Errol Lawson, who works at a marine engineering company, and Winsome Wood, a secretary at the Labor Ministry, picked up food after having installed window shutters at their cement block house. ''It's going to be rough,'' Ms. Wood said. ''Everything will go flying all over the place.'' By early evening, the downtown business district was deserted, with plywood and shutters over doors and windows. Many people said they just could not believe that a killer storm was on the way. Just the same, almost everyone seemed to take precautions. Lillian Wilmot, a homemaker, said she was in denial. ''I think it's going to go elsewhere,'' Ms. Wilmot said. ''At least I hope so.'' Even so, her husband, an insurance adjuster, had put up shutters, and they had plenty of emergency supplies. People recalled Hurricane Gilbert with a shiver. ''If this is anything like Gilbert,'' Vincent David, a customs broker, said, ''it's going to be quite a blow, even if we don't get the eye.'' At his neat house behind a high, whitewashed wall, Carl Maxwell, a baker, said he had just finished reinforcing his roof and cleared his yard of chairs and other objects ''that can become missiles.'' As he spoke, his daughter Tanique, 8, nuzzled close to him, clutching her pink and white teddy bear. She was worried, she said with wide eyes and a quick up and down bob of her head. ''I'm taking this very serious,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''I'm not taking it lightly.''"
"The citrus trees, once pregnant with fruit, have been stripped by the winds. The grapefruits and oranges, which once held the promise of months of steady wages, lie scattered in the muddy ground like brightly colored spherical pebbles. ''What are we going to pick now?'' asked Hugo González in Spanish, as the 22-year-old agricultural migrant worker sat at the door of his trailer two nights after Hurricane Frances rattled his home. ''You can't see oranges on the tree any more.'' The eyes of both Hurricanes Frances and Charley passed through Central Florida's Polk County, one of the state's top citrus producing areas, destroying as much as 90 percent of the local grapefruit harvest and as much as 50 percent of the orange crop. Statewide, the losses to the citrus crop are estimated at 20 percent. ''It's not worth staying here, because you don't make enough to pay expenses,'' said Mr. Gonzalez, who has worked for the last two years as one of Florida's estimated 25,000 citrus pickers and 150,000 agricultural workers. About 70 percent of them are illegal immigrants, according to the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project of Florida Legal Services. Mr. González said he came to central Florida from Mexico three months ago to wait for the beginning of the orange-picking season, which stretches from October to May. As he sees the promise of work decomposing in the fields, he wants to leave, but he said he could not afford to relocate. He said he paid smugglers $2,200 to bring him into the United States in a three-day desert walk. Now, he said, he barely has enough money to cover the $230 bus ticket back to his hometown, Pachuca, Mexico. ''Right now if I left, I would leave with just the fare and no money to eat,'' Mr. González said. He plans on working odd jobs over the next few weeks. The discussions about the oranges swirl around the taco cafe, the Winn-Dixie supermarket and the coin laundry here. The talk in other migrant agricultural communities is much the same. Where to go? What type of work to do? Some migrants have begun to leave Central Florida for Mexico, others in search of work elsewhere in the United States -- Michigan for blueberries, Georgia for watermelons, Kentucky for tobacco. Still others are scraping together work after the storm. Construction jobs pay $8 an hour and up. Collecting fallen branches off the streets brings in $4.50 a cubic yard. Collecting and selling scrap aluminum can be lucrative. But all this work is temporary at best. Mr. González said he had hoped to take home as much as $5,000 to help build the four-bedroom house he plans for his wife-to-be, who is waiting for him. This year, he said, he will leave with almost nothing but debt. The force of the hurricanes created a foot-wide split in the floor of the mobile home that Mr. González shares with another Mexican worker, but many other trailers in Polk County fared much worse. County inspectors have put red condemned stickers on trailers crushed by trees or stripped by winds, like those at THE Christmas Tree Mobile Home Park. The isolated park, which is predominantly Mexican-American, was neglected for days by the outside world after it was devastated by Hurricane Charley. It was days after Fort Meade residents received ice, water and other goods before neighbors realized the destruction at the park. ''They were pretty much fending for themselves,'' said Angel Catano, an area resident who was among the first outsiders to go to the park after the hurricane. Mr. Catano took 40 cases of water, 90 bags of ice and 15 boxes of food, then called his daughter, who works for the sheriff's office, for additional help. Florida's agricultural workers, many who originally come from Mexico, are among the most vulnerable victims of the double hurricanes. ''Not only are many migrant workers out of a job, they have lost what little they have,'' said Cheryl Little, the executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center. The Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, using state surveys, estimates that the winds and rain destroyed about 40 percent of the migrant housing that was legally occupied in Hardee and Desoto Counties. The destruction is expected to worsen an overstrained housing market for migrant workers. Only a small fraction of migrant housing has legal permits, the justice project said. Fears among some workers of revealing their illegal immigration status, along with cultural barriers, make many reluctant to come forward to ask for help. ''They don't want to give their information because they feel immigration is going to get a hold of it, and they're going to be deported,'' said Bernard Pita, a Spanish-speaking code inspector for Polk County who has been working with the Christmas Tree community. ''They usually are self-sufficient. They have a lot of pride.'' Rob Williams, director of the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, who has been pushing to liberalize immigration laws governing agricultural jobs, said of the illegal immigrant workers, '''They are an essential part of our economy, but when there is a storm, when they are at risk, we say, 'Well you are on your own now, you shouldn't have been here.''' Churches have tried to fill in the social safety net gap. ''For one thing, we don't ask who has documents or papers, who is illegal or not,'' said the Rev. Tom Rush, a pastor with First Baptist Church in Fort Meade. ''All of us have political opinions, but the issue of ministering to people in need isn't a political issue.'' Those who cannot leave will cope, said Carmen Escobar, 15, who has been helping her family pick oranges on weekends since she was 6. Ms. Escobar, who dropped out of junior high school, shrugs at the destruction. Already, her boyfriend's family has converted the orange truck to hauling fallen branches. They earned $100 for one truckload recently. ''You don't need to be cutting down anything,'' she said. ''You just need to put it in the truck. It's easy.''"
"The wind was picking up here Thursday afternoon as Hurricane Frances worked its way up the Bahamas, kicking up 15-foot waves in the sparsely populated southeastern islands. But Mervyn Taylor, a graying civil servant, was playing a leisurely game of dominoes outside the Columbus Primary School with some friends who, like himself, had boarded up their houses and now were just waiting for the storm. Mr. Taylor and the others had heard the reports of hundreds of thousands of Floridians clogging the highways in an urgent exodus from the beaches. But, he said, having lived all his life on one or another of the 700 islands that make up the Bahamas, the idea of trying to run from a hurricane never occurred to him. ''Where are you going to go?'' he asked with a little resigned smile. ''There's nowhere to go in the Bahamas,'' he said, acknowledging the low, unprotected way Nassau and the rest of New Providence Island and its neighbors ride in a sea that, as he spoke, was getting angrier by the minute. Even if he should have suddenly decided he wanted to leave for some larger land mass, it was too late. ''There aren't any flights going out,'' he said. The airport closed Thursday afternoon after an Air Canada flight left at 1:30 for Toronto, loaded mostly with tourists and a few Bahamian émigrés who had been visiting family. The last of the oceangoing ships left Nassau for safer waters a little after midnight. Winds of more than 120 miles an hour slammed San Salvador Island, where more than 900 people live and where the eye crossed Thursday. Electricity and phone services were down on Long Island, which has about 3,000 residents. In a potentially ominous sign, Frances's movement slowed from 13 m.p.h. on Thursday afternoon to 9 m.p.h. on Thursday night. ''That usually means the hurricane is strengthening,'' said Gerald Sawyer, president of the Bahamas Red Cross, the Associated Press reported. Sharon and Dennis Brown, here on their honeymoon from Brookville, Md., would have been happy to leave. But their flight was canceled Thursday morning. ''I don't know what to expect,'' said Mrs. Brown, a legal secretary. For the Browns, like most of the roughly 200,000 residents of Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas which takes up most of New Providence Island and operates closely with adjacent Paradise Island, evacuation was not an option. And with the storm moving closer to New Providence, the most populated of the islands, officials were worried, even though the reports of damage from the Turks and Caicos, the first victims of Hurricane Frances, and from other islands to the south, have been better than expected. Prime Minister Perry Christie has been urging Bahamians to move away from the beaches and into churches and schools that have been turned into shelters. But on Thursday afternoon, Carl Smith, who is directing the Bahamas's national emergency operations center, said the shelters were not filling up. It is not that Bahamians are fearless. Plywood sheeting and steel shutters have been put over the windows of nearly every store on Bay Street, a duty-free promenade in pastel-painted British colonial architecture. And the canvas roofing on the Straw Market, the sprawling bazaar that offers souvenirs to cruise passengers, has been pulled down to give the wind less to chew on, leaving a skeleton of aluminum trusses open to the darkening sky. ''I'm scared to death,'' said Athena Curry, who was born here and now lives with her three sons in a typical three-bedroom concrete block house in the middle of New Providence Island. ''It's going to flatten us.'' For Mrs. Curry, like many other Bahamians, money was not a reason for staying put. Tourism and a strong offshore banking business, which employs Mrs. Curry, have helped build a solid middle class. But many Bahamians profess a deep fatalism in a community where prayer and churchgoing are common currency. At the same time, they talk of decades of close brushes with hurricanes in which the worst blows have landed elsewhere. ''Many of these storms have come and we're still here,'' Mr. Taylor said. Andrew Stubbs, a stevedore who moved his dominoes with explosive clacks on the rough sheet of plywood the men were using for a table, agreed with Mr. Taylor. ''The majority of the hurricanes turn away,'' he said. ''We're a blessed people. But I feel we are going to catch a strong effect from this one.''"
"Jupiter Island, a small, shy Eden where the wealthy of yesterday, today and tomorrow play golf and bridge, cultivated itself for decades as a special community, preserving its aura behind a veil of hedges and banyan trees. Then Hurricane Frances arrived with a giant set of pruning shears, and hacked the garden out of the Eden. In ZIP code 33455, rated by Forbes magazine as the wealthiest neighborhood in the nation (with a median home price of $5.6 million), the shrubbery has been shredded. Roses were blown from their beds. Coconut palms scattered fronds, coconuts and serrated trunks everywhere. Felled banyan and seagrape, not to mention oak and pine trees, littered driveways. Cocoplum hedges were shredded. ''The walls are down at Jupiter Island,'' said Ghada Dergham, the proprietor at Jupiter Island Landscape, who planted or hung many of the orchids and ficus that are now gone. ''They can see each other. That's going to drive them crazy.'' It is not a concern that Jupiter Island residents would be likely to put above the concern for basic needs, like food and shelter, that are consuming the areas of the state hardest hit by Hurricane Frances, or those still reeling from Hurricane Charley. After all, 54 shelters, concentrated in east-central Florida, were still housing 4,933 people as of Wednesday afternoon and 1.4 million people remained without power. Gasoline shortages, while easing, were still producing significant lines at filling stations in Martin, St. Lucie and Palm Beach counties. President Bush took a helicopter tour Wednesday over damaged areas, including Fort Pierce, about 25 miles north of Jupiter Island where much of the damage from the strong winds north of the hurricane's eye occurred. He also helped put bottled water, bags of ice and food in the backs of waiting cars in Fort Pierce, and signed legislation giving Florida $2 billion in emergency relief aid. At the north and south entrances to Jupiter Island, a community in which the president's grandfather, Prescott Bush, played a central role in the 1930's, and where his grandmother lived for years, National Guardsmen monitored the flow of electrical and other repair people in and out of the island, which even at ordinary times is one of the best-guarded communities in the nation. Only essential personnel were allowed on. But on Jupiter Island, landscape gardners are first responders, and Ms. Dergham was out on the island at the same time as the electrical workers, surveying more than 60 of the 475 or so yards and coordinating the arrival of tree-trimmers and maintenance personnel. ''I looked at 60 houses today,'' said Ms. Dergham, who has plenty of clients off the island as well, and who spent part of this afternoon supervising the resurrection and replanting of a thickly canopied seagrape tree that had fallen not far from Duffy's, a restaurant in Jupiter, a mainland community that shares part of a name with Jupiter Island but is more visitor-friendly. For one thing, Jupiter has commercial establishments like malls and Duffy's. The only commercial entity on Jupiter Island is a small real estate office, said one resident, who, not wanting to break with the island's traditional reticence, spoke on condition that his name not be used. On Tuesday, Ms. Dergham spent the morning and afternoon going up one driveway on Jupiter Island after another, to get a sense of the damage and respond to some of the worried calls from residents who knew that Hurricane Frances had made landfall only 20 miles away. ''Some of the old oaks are gone,'' she said, walking up one driveway with a reporter and photographer. In keeping with the island's traditions, the journalists had to have the permission of a resident to get past the National Guard. She wound her way carefully through the branches, waving a stick to keep away the multitudinous spiders, with bodies the size of 50-cent pieces and legs three inches long, that had been flushed from low-lying areas by the rain. ''There's a saying we have here,'' she said. ''When any insect like spiders come out of the woods, it means we're going to have a bad hurricane season.'' The spiders, she said, started appearing on the walls of at least one home several days before Hurricane Frances hit. Now there were dozens on the walls and in newly made webs in the branches of the fallen trees. She took an inventory and found that about 60 percent of the major shrubbery was gone. The palms, which have fronds that present the least resistance to the wind, had fared the best. And some trees that stayed upright had undergone prophylactic ''hurricane pruning,'' Ms. Dergham said. The orchids, she said, were surprising survivors, at least the ones that had been hung from trees so that residents would have a garden at eye level. A boat tour around the island showed that other landmark plantings, like the palm trees above the golf course, had the look of a really bad hair day. Also, the dockmaster's house was gone, and part of the largest dock with it. One resident's orchid house was completely destroyed, Ms. Dergham said. And, she added, delicate tropical plants showed their delicacy. ''The haliconias got pretty beat up.'' Replanting will be expensive, she added. To get a basic clean-up and some replanting done will cost ''between $4,000 and $20,000,'' she said. Heavy cranes, a necessity in such work, are charging at least 50 percent more an hour than usual, she said. Nonetheless, one driveway littered with trees on Tuesday had been cleared enough to be passable by Wednesday. The fees for restocking and tending orchid gardens can run from $1,000 to $30,000 annually. And, she said, ''vegetation availability is going to be tight -- the hurricane hit a lot of nurseries too.'' But she now has a notion of what plants are hurricane-resistant -- particularly the flowering shrubs like arboricola trinette. The quicker a resident wants to regain privacy, she said, the higher the cost is going to be. ''Instant privacy is expensive,'' she said. ''The larger species of vegetation cost money.'' Money, here, is not likely to be an issue."
"The remnants of Hurricane Frances moved slowly through the East yesterday, continuing to spawn tornadoes, flooding and mudslides that have destroyed homes and businesses, downed bridges, closed roads and killed at least six people since the storm left Florida. The core of the storm, downgraded to a tropical depression, passed from the Carolinas through Ohio yesterday and Tuesday, leaving the town of Marshall in western North Carolina with a three-day total of 20 inches of rain, said Peter Gabrielsen, chief of hydrologic services for the Eastern region of the National Weather Service. South Carolina reported 24 confirmed tornadoes. Tens of thousands of customers in the Southeast were without power, 51,000 in Georgia alone. Homes and businesses were destroyed in Virginia, though the damage there was relatively light, officials said. As for fatalities, a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of Public Safety said one person was killed Tuesday when a car hit a tree that had been blown over. And in its earlier trek through Georgia, the storm caused at least five traffic deaths as rains and high winds knocked trees and debris into roads and cars hydroplaned on soaked streets Monday night and Tuesday, said Ken Davis, a spokesman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. In North Carolina, flooding kept boat rescue teams busy, and a helicopter that had been called to rescue one woman ended up plucking nine people out of trees, said Patty McQuillan, a state public safety spokeswoman. In Mitchell County alone, in the western end of the state, 200 homes were cut off by floods. ''A lot of people just don't want to leave home; they want to try to take care of what's theirs,'' said Detective Andy Ward of the Mitchell County Sheriff's Office. ''Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.'' At one point, state officials said, the Toe River was rising in that county at eight feet an hour, carrying oil barrels that floated down it after facilities of two oil companies flooded."
"As the trailing winds of Tropical Storm Frances whipped up thunderstorms in eastern Florida towns, the stubborn storm on Monday made its second landfall in the state, pounding the Panhandle with winds of up to 65 miles an hour. These final blows from the storm's two-day trek across the state added to the frustration of millions of evacuated residents impatient to be rid of it. Many defied warnings in their rush to discover if the winds and rains had left their signatures on hastily abandoned homes. Even before its final act, the storm that refused to fade -- not so much fearsome as ''just pesty,'' in the words of Cindy Hoffman, a Daytona Beach resident -- had left four people dead and about six million without power and caused widespread flooding that could threaten property, health and mobility. Fourteen inches of rain fell over two days on Palm Beach County, while Martin and St. Lucie Counties absorbed 12 inches and Daytona Beach nearly that much. The White House announced Monday that it would supplement, by an unspecified amount, its previous request that Congress appropriate about $2 billion ''to pay for the response and recovery efforts related to Hurricane Charley,'' which did extensive damage to the state last month. Eighteen counties have been declared eligible for federal disaster aid as a result of Hurricane Frances. By Monday night, the National Weather Service had downgraded the storm to a tropical depression as its winds slowed to 35 miles an hour. The number of deaths in Florida attributed to the storm rose to nine, The Associated Press reported. The dead included a grandson and former son-in-law of Bobby Bowden, the former Florida State University football coach, who were killed in a collision on a wet hightway, The A.P. said. The storm was blamed for two deaths in the Bahamas, and The A.P. said there was one storm-related death in Georgia. Across the Florida peninsula, the eagerness to get back to a normal existence was repeatedly thwarted by widespread holes in the infrastructure. From Palm Beach County up to Orlando in Orange County, people waited in line for gasoline, while in western Broward County milk was in short supply. Most traffic lights had not been blown onto roadways, but most were not working, giving major state routes the stop-and-start feel of small-town roads. More than 205,000 customers lost their home phone service, while 30 percent of the cellphone customers whose home base was in the strom's path lost service. In coastal areas from Jupiter Beach north to Daytona Beach, people were turned away at the causeways to beach communities or had to wait in line and show identification to cross. On radio and television, public officials urged residents to bide their time for a few more days. But many were deaf to the urging. ''Everything's jammed up with cars coming back,'' said Mary Grace Sprow, a fire and rescue worker at the emergency operations center in Stuart, the Martin County seat, north of West Palm Beach. ''It's bumper to bumper on U.S. 1 and conditions here aren't great. There's no electricity, no phones.'' This did little to deter many homeowners, who were often relieved at what they found. ''Lucky'' was the word many people used to describe themselves after they rushed across the reopened bridge to the coastal developments along the battered barrier island of Vero Beach. ''Unbelievable act of kindness,'' said Carol Silvestri, 38, recalling the oaks and other trees that fell in her yard, not on her house. ''Just lucked out.'' Mike McLaughlin, 60, was struck by the images that greeted him: ''Dead moles in the front yard. Catfish swimming up the street.'' But Michael DiTerlizzi, a Martin County commissioner, said he was worried about returning evacuees. ''We're urging them to stay away,'' Mr. DiTerlizzi said Monday. ''The streets are a mess. We have street lights, power lines and telephone poles down all over the county. After the storm is the most dangerous time. People get out and move around and they don't realize the power line they're stepping on is hot.'' While power lines dangled and tornadoes threatened, homeowners, public safety officials and others were inspecting the damage and keeping a lookout for looters. At least 15 people were arrested in central Florida on Sunday and Monday for looting. These included 4 of 10 men in Orlando who drove a car into a clothing store and took $10,000 in merchandise, and one in Daytona Beach who walked into a darkened, wind-damaged store and was beginning to help himself when a police officer inside chased and arrested him. Early assessments of the damage to the Kennedy Space Center indicated that it was ''the worst that the K.S.C. has experienced since its inception in the early 60's,'' James W. Kennedy, the center director, said in a conference call with reporters. The Vehicle Assembly Building, usually devoted to the preparation of the space shuttle for launching and currently storing external shuttle tanks and vehicles, was a ''checkerboard'' of 1,000 missing panels, ''40,000 feet of open window'' exposed to the elements, Mr. Kennedy said. The buildings housing the three remaining shuttles did not appear to have sustained extensive damage. In Orlando, where a wet summer had left the groundwater abnormally high even before the downpours of Hurricanes Charley and Frances, wastewater began to back up into the bathtubs of a few homes as groundwater infiltrated the municipal waste water system and one-third of the city's pumps lost power, Alan Oyler, the city's deputy public works director, said. While Orlando officials were hustling generators from one lifeless pump to the next, the storm's center hit the Panhandle on Monday morning in a broad swath from St. Marks to the mouth of the Aucilla River in Taylor County, bringing with it another wave of power losses, tree topplings and damaged roofs. ''If they haven't experienced a Hurricane Charley, they would think it horrible, when really it's minor to moderate,'' said Roy Woods, the Taylor County emergency management director. To the east, on highways whose northbound lanes had been crowded five days ago, southbound lanes began to fill as caravans of electrical and telephone repair crews joined thousands of state residents on the trek into the areas of central Florida stricken by Hurricane Frances. And Walt Disney World opened two of its four theme parks, Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center, to the relief of stir-crazy residents whose movements had been restricted by the winds and widespread curfews. ''I wanted to get out of the house,'' Brenda Becker, 43, of Kissimee, Fla., said. ''I wanted to get out and watch something else besides the four walls. It is really dark because it is still boarded up from the storm, and we didn't know whether to take it down because of the next hurricane.'' At least six cruise ships with an estimated 12,000 passengers waited offshore near Cape Canaveral and were expected to arrive late Tuesday or early Wednesday, said the Canaveral Port director, Stan Payne. The buoys that mark the route into port were moved out of position during the storm, and the Coast Guard decided not to allow the ships back until they were back in place. Marinas and boats have been heavily damaged through out the state. Some of the greatest damage has been in Palm Beach County. ''From what I understand, some of the docks got wiped away and took yachts with them,'' Jeanne Peterson, an official at of the Palm Beach County emergency operations center, said. ''I think that's one industry that received major damage.'' State officials say Florida's citrus crop was hit hard for a second time after taking a beating from Hurricane Charley three weeks ago. They say sugar cane fields west of West Palm Beach also suffered. Ice was in short supply throughout the state, and many residents lacked running water, both as a consequence of power outages. Ms. Peterson said officials had opened distribution points for water, ice and ready-to-eat meals. The supplies, she said, had been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She said the agency planned also to send 770,000 containers of baby formula to Palm Beach County and 30,000 rolls of canvas tarpaulins for roofs. HURRICANE FRANCES: THE OVERVIEW Correction: September 9, 2004, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the damage caused by Hurricane Frances referred incorrectly in some copies to Bobby Bowden, whose grandson and former son-in-law were among the people killed in the storm. He is the current Florida State University football coach, not the former one."
"Just off the sea wall in front of the big blocky Mercy Hospital, a 35-foot navy blue sloop with an aquamarine stripe lay nose down this morning in Biscayne Bay, its stern jutting out of the pale green water and its mast tilting at a crazy angle. At the Key Biscayne Yacht Club, a dozen open-cockpit skiffs and sailboats and big cabin cruisers, some more than 40 feet long, were sprawled on the beach and tangled in the mangroves, owners and tow services' tugs working to get them back afloat. In the wake of Hurricane Frances, broken boats and torn up marinas litter Florida's Atlantic Coast, the shores of inland lakes and stretches of the Gulf Coast, creating a nightmare for thousands of weekend sailors and professional skippers and delivering a heavy blow to one of the state's proudest symbols and sources of tens of thousands of jobs. Henry Cabbage, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, which helps regulate small-boat operations in the state, said initial reports suggested heavy damage to boats and marina operators. ''We know there is substantial damage to many of the marinas where the storm hit so far, and it isn't over yet,'' Mr. Cabbage said on Monday. ''Damage to boats is going to be enormous,'' he said. State officials estimate there are nearly one million small boats and yachts registered in Florida. Some cities, like Fort Lauderdale, are packed with marinas, custom boat factories, brokerages and marine supply shops. ''It's a big business,'' said Capt. Burt Korpela, an owner of Atlantis Marine Towing and Salvage, in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, who spent most of Monday pulling wrecked vessels off sand bars and beaches and the bottom of Biscayne Bay. Still on Captain Korpela's rescue list Monday afternoon were a 21-foot open fishing boat sunk bow-up at the Key Biscayne Marina, not far from the yacht club, and another power boat about the same size with one side ripped off. ''They were tied up,'' he said, ''and they beat up against the dock all night long during the storm.'' Like many of the other damaged vessels, the sailboat that sank off Mercy Hospital tore loose from its moorings out in Biscayne Bay and slammed into the sea wall with such force that it ripped off part of its bow. The marine mayhem is even more extensive along the stretch of waterfront and waterways beginning around West Palm Beach and extending north beyond Fort Pierce, marina operators and boaters said in interviews. The strongest winds of Hurricane Frances crossed the beach in that area. Some marinas were splintered, with yachts and power boats tossed in all directions. In Stuart, a city of about 45,000 that lies north of West Palm Beach and south of Fort Pierce and is the Martin County seat, Michael DiTerlizzi, a county commissioner, said the St. Lucie River, which runs past his house, simply boiled up and ripped off a big chunk of his dock. ''Most docks in Martin County have sustained tremendous damage or complete devastation,'' Mr. DiTerlizzi said in a telephone interview. ''An awful lot of boats lost their moorings and are littering the waterfront of the St. Lucie River and the Indian River lagoon. I've seen easily 50 or 60 boats myself. There are about a dozen wrecked boats just along my street.'' At the CannonSport Marina on Singer Island, south of Stuart, the owner, Tom Mills, was cleaning up debris with his three grown children and three young grandchildren who, he said, were mostly supervising. But the family crew could not begin to get the marina functioning again. Before the hurricane, Mr. Mills said, ''we had 40 slips.'' But ''we're down to nothing right now.'' ''One section just lifted off the pilings and floated away,'' he said. ''But the major damage was from boats that were anchored, broke loose and slammed into the marina.'' Looking in one direction from his marina on the edge of Lake Worth, a sliver of water that stretches about 30 miles from the city of Lake Worth to beyond West Palm Beach, Mr. Mills said he could see about 20 sunken sailboats in the shallows near the beach. In another direction, he said, six more sailboats had made it all the way to the beach. Yet another sailboat banged into the Blue Heron Bridge, connecting Singer Island with Riviera Beach. On Monday it lay on its side, its mast caught on a bridge railing. ''One fellow came looking for his boat this morning,'' Mr. Mills said. ''He saw something that looked familiar but he said, 'That can't be mine. It had two masts.' He looked again and saw that it really was his boat. But half of it was gone.'' Mr. Mills, who is also the mayor of the small resort town of Palm Beach Shores, estimated it would cost $750,000 to repair his marina. His big worry, he said, was that he would not be able to get the work done before the first of November, when he begins to welcome a fleet of luxurious yachts, some costing more than $10 million, for stays of several months through the mild Florida winter. None of the 30 cabin cruisers, sport fishers and sailboats tied up at Mr. Mills's marina before the storm were harmed. All had been taken to sheltered coves inland. Many of the boats at marinas in Miami were also taken to cover and were unscathed. At Monty's Marina, in Coconut Grove, many slips were still empty on Monday. And with Hurricane Ivan making its way north through the Caribbean, the boaters were in no hurry to leave their sanctuaries. ''They're going to keep their vessels where they are,'' said Erica Korpela, the salvage coordinator at Atlantis Marine and Captain Korpela's wife, ''until they have a better idea of where Ivan is going.'' HURRICANE FRANCES: ON THE WATER"
"Hurricane Ivan spared Cuba the worst of its fury on Monday, skirting the western tip of the island before lurching toward Mexico and then returning to its slow, fearsome path to the United States Gulf Coast. Unnerved by the televised images of the destruction from the storm, a Category 5 hurricane, and memories of hurricanes from years ago and weeks ago, residents from the Big Bend of Florida to the Louisiana coast prepared. The storm seemed to combine the size and agonizing slowness of the recent Hurricane Frances with power greater than that of Hurricane Charley. Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans, a city largely below sea level and extremely vulnerable to hurricanes, urged anyone who could leave to get out as soon as possible. ''It's my feeling that this storm will pass very close to New Orleans,'' Mr. Nagin told The Associated Press Monday night. At a news conference in Tallahassee earlier in the day, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said that even with the long-term forecasts showing the eye of the hurricane making landfall farther to the west than earlier ones, no one in the possible strike zone should think that the danger had passed. ''This is not the time to be defiant or let people know you're a macho man,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This is a powerful force of nature that you should not be messing with.'' Part of the Yucatán Peninsula, a popular tourist area, was under hurricane warning on Monday night as the storm passed through the channel between Mexico and Cuba. Officials ordered cruise ships to stay at sea and removed an estimated 15,000 people from the peninsula. Hotels from Cozumel to Cancún boarded windows, but had decided not to remove guests. In the Gulf of Mexico, GlobalSantaFe, the second-largest offshore oil driller in the world, shut its entire fleet and removed 495 workers. At least 68 people have been killed in Venezuela, Grenada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Cayman Airways, the flag carrier of the Cayman Islands, announced that it had canceled all flights through Wednesday. The Owen Roberts International Airport was in restricted use and gave no indication of when it would fully reopen. ''Winds ripped apartments like matchsticks,'' one radio report from Grand Cayman said, according to The Associated Press. ''The whole island has taken a battering. Cars and trucks were floating away like toys.'' But the government of the Islands, which the storm grazed on Sunday, said that the country had suffered ''no reported casualties.'' In a news release it added, ''There has been extensive water damage to a number of buildings, but the vast majority remain structurally sound.'' The western half of Cuba, known for producing some of the best cigars, was battered by heavy rains and winds, and there were concerns about flooding. As the storm passed Cuba, most of the country remained on alert and locked down. Businesses remained closed, and streets were empty. Still, relief was palpable everywhere. In the days that Hurricane Ivan approached the island, the Communist government began an extensive civil defense operation that often felt like a call to arms. More than one million people, mostly women and children, were removed from crumbling or flimsy housing. Men stayed to defend their homes. Hundreds of thousands of tons of food and sugar were stored in fortified warehouses. State workers removed street lights and safeguarded gasoline stations. The state television dedicated almost all broadcasts to explaining the magnitude and course of the storm. President Fidel Castro was on the air much of the time, listening to high-ranking officers report from around the country about conditions and preparedness. In the morning, the aging but ever-charismatic president told reporters that he was grateful for the ''kind attitude'' of the hurricane in bypassing Cuba. He told reporters that his country had stood against threats of nuclear attack, and decades of economic sanctions. ''This storm,'' he said, ''only renews our strength and our solidarity.'' Watching Mr. Castro, a television anchor commented, ''Always on the front lines of combat.'' At 11 p.m., the eye was off the western tip of Cuba, moving northwest at 9 miles an hour with maximum sustained winds near 160 miles an hour. The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that hurricane-force winds extended 100 miles from the center and that tropical-storm-force winds stretched 200 miles from the center. The uncertainty about the storm's course, combined with what was apparent certainty that it would hit Gulf Coast communities hard, left Floridians with mixed emotions, and moving in opposite directions. Although curling bands of clouds and rain from the storm spread north over the Keys and the Miami metropolitan region, most of the tens of thousands of residents who had left the Keys began returning. In areas like Pensacola, however, residents were making evacuation plans. In the two westernmost counties of the Florida Panhandle, Escambia and Santa Rosa, emergency officials said people living in mobile homes and vulnerable sites like coastal and low-lying areas should evacuate. Hurricane Opal hit the two counties hard in 1995. The Santa Rosa emergency management director, Dave Ling, was hoarse when he said: ''Whether people remember Hurricane Opal or not, the images of Charley and Frances has everybody energized. They're getting prepared.'' Paulette Travis, an assistant manager at Fireworks World, a store the size of an airplane hangar in Robertsdale, Ala., that was going to be boarded shut, said: ''When I bought that plywood on Friday, not too many people were shopping. But they've heard now, believe me.'' Nightmares of Hurricane Frederick's striking Mobile, Ala., in 1979 inspired Mrs. Travis to stock up on supplies early. ''God spared me in that longest night of my life because he knew I was a single mother with nowhere to go,'' Mrs. Travis said. ''This time, my mobile home is tied down. But I will be leaving with my personal photos as soon as I can.'' The emergency management director in Florida, W. Craig Fugate, said the Panhandle and Big Bend, the curve where the western side of the peninsula begins, were especially vulnerable to flooding. The western stretch has many flood prone rivers, and the bend is a dead end for the tidal surge from hurricanes. Mr. Bush conceded that residents were worn thin. ''I don't know if it's the five-day forecasts or the slowing down of the last two storms that's created a little bit of a challenge in terms of people's patience levels,'' the governor said. He encouraged residents not to fixate on the day-to-day swings of the storm. Everyone in the danger zone, he said, should prepare and then focus on other thoughts, perhaps the outstanding high-school and college football teams in the state. At the hurricane center, meteorologists eyed a new worry, an unnamed tropical depression with sustained winds of up to 30 miles an hour gathered strength and was possibly on course for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico."
"At the National Hurricane Center, a gray bunker bristling with satellite dishes on the outskirts of Miami, meteorologists scanned readings last weekend gleaned by aircraft plunging into the eye of Hurricane Ivan and they squinted at satellite images while preparing a fresh forecast for the track of the dangerous storm. After assessing the data and the output of half a dozen supercomputer storm simulations, Stacy R. Stewart sat in front of a map of the Atlantic and Caribbean with an eraser and colored pencils, drawing the storm track newly estimated for the next five days. The map was filled with erasures of older storm projections that had at one point been the best bet but now were off by hundreds of miles as the storm's northerly curve drifted west. This is the state of hurricane science in the new century: a mix of growing skill and persistent uncertainty, of intuition and algorithms, satellites and erasers. A great deal has been learned from remote sensing and eye-diving aircraft and computers running trillions of calculations a second. Predictions are improving. But in the midst of such progress, the forces that guide the path and growth of individual hurricanes remain cloaked in mysteries, like the hidden eye in the swirling, miles-high bands of cloud and rain. Never has the need for improved forecasts been greater. Not only are more people in harm's way, on coasts from Asia to Florida, but most experts now agree that after two decades of relative quiescence the Atlantic will have increased hurricane activity for up to several decades. The reason is that the Atlantic Ocean shifted, as of 1995, to a pattern of water temperatures and air circulation that energizes storms. Experts also foresee a slow rise in hurricane intensity and rainfall from global warming. While forecasting individual storms remains a vexing challenge, the projections of hurricane paths have improved enough that last year the hurricane center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, lengthened its forecasts from three days to five.The change came after two years of testing showed that the five-day forecasts were as accurate as three-day forecasts had been 15 years earlier. The forecasts create a broad ''error cone'' of possible tracks, often widening by hundreds of miles beyond the third day. But they can be of great value to the Navy and emergency-management offices, which had clamored for years for NOAA to expand its hurricane horizons. The Navy needs nearly a week to safeguard the big fleets in harbors like Pensacola and Jacksonville, Fla., and emergency planners want to know where they should stockpile supplies and move the staff. Unfortunately, many residents of hurricane country do not understand how to interpret the longer forecasts. If one looks only at the centerline, the changes in predictions may seem extreme. That line can waver back and forth ''in a windshield-wiper effect'' one day to the next, said Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center. In recent days, as the centerline showing the most probable path of the storm wavered over Florida and back into the gulf several times, each new computer run seemed to spawn bursts of panic buying of gasoline and groceries across large portions of the storm-weary state. At one point, uncertainty was so great that some nursing homes on both the east and the west coasts were simultaneously preparing to evacuate in opposite directions. ''The longer-range forecasting really helps us in terms of our planning and giving us that sort of cone where we think things are going to go,'' said Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But for the public, he conceded, ''I think that can be a kind of frustration.'' Gov. Jeb Bush echoed that frustration at a news conference on Monday, encouraging citizens not to fixate on the day-to-day swings of the storm tracks. ''I don't know if it's the five-day forecasts or the slowing down of the last two storms that's created a little bit of a challenge in terms of people's patience,'' he said. Dr. Roger A. Pielke Jr., a science policy expert at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said government agencies of all sorts still had a lot to learn about alerting the public to uncertain risks, with the Department of Homeland Security's color coding of terrorist threats another example. It is important to keep in mind just how much worse hurricane forecasts were not long ago, said Robert E. Tuleya, a meteorologist and hurricane modeler at Old Dominion University. For a storm like Ivan, he said, ''Ten years ago we would have been alerting the whole gulf coast and the southeast Atlantic coast.'' Now, the meteorologists at the Miami center are producing a fresh five-day forecast at least four times a day, shaping preparations for what could still end up being an exceedingly rare third hurricane strike on Florida in one season. Still, as of Monday the hurricane could hit as far west as New Orleans and as far east as Tallahassee. Hurricane Ivan's devastating march across the tropics after it formed as anonymous Tropical Depression 9 on Sept. 2 was precisely predicted because a big ridge of high pressure around the Bahamas steered it as predictably as rails carry a train. But its new territory, the Gulf of Mexico, has no such clear ''steering'' forces. It holds a mix of conditions almost guaranteed to make this hurricane a maverick. It could well be weakened because the winds in the upper atmosphere are out of sync with those near the surface, creating a condition called shear that can pull apart the towering eye walls that contain the hurricane's combustion chamber. But it is also going to slow to an agonizing crawl, forecasters said. The combination of slow speed and no clear zones of low and high pressure that either push or tug at such storms has created the potential disaster zone of more than 350 miles across. Some influences on such giant storms have become much better understood, like the role of El Niño warmings of the Pacific in shaping high-altitude winds that can shear the tops off Atlantic hurricanes. Indeed, a weak Niño condition is developing now, although any storm-damping influence would not come before October, forecasters say. And new technologies have clarified how storms grow. A fresh advance has come from cloud-probing radars aboard NASA's TRMM satellite, which monitors tropical precipitation. The radar essentially provides a CT scan, revealing the presence of fast-rising columns of air that act as energy pumps, allowing the storms to transfer the heat of tropical waters skyward. The budget for the satellite was nearly cut this year but was restored once scientists explained its importance to storm forecasting. Other forces that nurture or kill hurricanes have only just been discovered, like the impact of hot, dry, dusty layers of air blown off the Sahara, which can race westward across the Atlantic, catching up to a hurricane and decapitating it from behind, said Jason Dunion, a federal hurricane expert in Miami. One area of little progress is estimating whether a storm will strengthen or weaken. ''There are so many pieces of the intensity puzzle,'' Mr. Dunion said last week, just before taking off in a government Gulfstream jet out of Tampa to pepper Hurricane Ivan with dozens of canisters that transmit wind, temperature, humidity and air pressure readings every half second. Even with an incomplete picture, the hurricane center has to generate its forecasts. They have steadily improved in predicting storms' actual paths, albeit at a pace of about 1 percent a year, Mr. Dunion said. Some improvements have come not only in the half dozen leading computer models, run on potent machines from Camp Springs, Md., to Reading, England, but also in how their output is interpreted. Increasingly, for example, the federal forecasts are influenced by a computer program at Florida State University in Tallahassee that analyzes all the other models' predictions as an ensemble, watching for which ones best track the actual storm movements and which ones have explainable errors. It adjusts for the errors and produces a more accurate forecast, scientists say. But the forecasters at the hurricane center still have the final say and often reject trends indicated by the computers, particularly when conditions are like those in the Gulf of Mexico at the moment. Without clear clues from the atmosphere, the computer forecasts splay ''like the legs of a squashed spider,'' said Mr. Mayfield, the hurricane center director. Late Monday afternoon, Stacy Stewart was once again the forecaster charged with charting Hurricane Ivan's next moves. Once again he would stare at an arcing array of computer screens showing the Technicolor pinwheel of clouds and all the vulnerable possible targets, from Havana to New Orleans. And once again he would wield his pencils, and assuredly his eraser. Correction: September 16, 2004, Thursday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about predicting the path and growth of hurricanes referred incorrectly to the Navy installations in Pensacola and Jacksonville, Fla. They are naval air stations; they do not have fleets of ships. Correction: October 4, 2004, Monday An article in Science Times on Sept. 14 about predicting hurricanes referred incorrectly to the Navy installation in Pensacola, Fla. It is a naval air station; it does not have a fleet of large ships. A correction of that article in this space on Sept. 16 referred incompletely to the harbor in Jacksonville, Fla. In addition to the Jacksonville Naval Air Station, it indeed has a base with ships, the Mayport Naval Station."
"Karl Bradford swept a calloused hand toward the middle of the coffee-colored Hope River, raging swollen after the drenching rains of Hurricane Ivan. ''The church is gone,'' he said as a brilliant Caribbean sun struggled to break through retreating layers of gray storm clouds on Sunday afternoon. ''Right there where you see the river running, that's where the church stood,'' Mr. Bradford, a private security guard, said. The pastor's house had been right beside the church, he said, and now it was a pile of concrete slabs rising in the river like a stone outcropping. The church and Bishop Melford Arnold's home were swept into the river along with a half dozen other houses in Tavern, a working-class neighborhood of Kingston, as Hurricane Ivan pounded Jamaica's south coast. An additional 10 houses were dragged into the water on the other side of the Hope River in the Kintyre neighborhood. Somehow, no one was killed or injured in Tavern or Kintyre, but Anthony McKenzie said that moments after he had lifted his 9-year-old twins, a boy and a girl, to safety through a window and dived out after them, his house toppled into the river. The patch of destruction in the foothills of eastern Kingston is emblematic of the work of Hurricane Ivan in Jamaica. Though the wreckage in much of the island consists of uprooted and broken trees, and ripped-off roofs and awnings, government officials say they are receiving reports of total ruin in pockets of the country like Tavern and Kintyre. They are places that are hard to find on the map, but where people have been working for years to build homes, often a room or a section at a time. They now have no idea where they are going to live or how they could possibly rebuild. In other parts of the country, at least 15 people have been killed. Friday night, when Hurricane Ivan hovered over Tavern with winds up to 130 miles an hour, was a night of terror for those who lived near the Hope River. It was also a night of neighbor helping neighbor, some holding hands in a human chain to hoist people and possessions out of the floodwaters in pitch darkness, with tree limbs and sheets of roofing flying around them. And it was a time of a daring police rescue of half a dozen people from flooded houses that eventually tore apart and were carried away. Before the hurricane, debris had clogged the 20 or so narrow concrete channels running beneath the Tavern Bridge. Floodwaters backed up and then surged toward the bank of the road, cutting a new path for the river and washing away the land holding the church and the other buildings. About 8 p.m. Friday, water began rising in the house nearest the bridge, where Lorna Wilson and her husband, Daniel Tomlinson, an auto body worker, were riding out the storm with their son, Tarik, 6. ''We heard a bang, and the wind and the water knocked the carport off into the river,'' Ms. Wilson said. They rushed to take shelter in a neighbor's house, she said, and ''then we heard a big rumbling and saw our house in the river.'' Most of the neighborhood still did not know the river was threatening. But about 9 p.m. Friday, Chevine Clark, 32, a hair stylist, decided to go out into the storm to see what she could see. She found knee-deep water gushing down River Heights Road and began yelling to sound the alarm. Sandra Thomas, who is eight months' pregnant, was in her living room with her son Kemar, 15. Ms. Thomas said: ''I heard somebody calling, 'The river is coming up. The river is coming up.''' She stepped into the flooding road in front of her house with Kemar and called to her husband, Denzil, to grab their other son, Akeam, 5, and get out of the house. The churning water was already eating away at the footings of the church. As the church and Bishop Arnold's house tumbled into the river, someone called the police. Constable Raymond Richards and several other officers answered the call. He said half a dozen people had been in the water. ''We couldn't see them,'' Constable Richards recalled. ''We called out to them and they responded.'' He threw a rope in the direction of the voices, he said. Someone grabbed hold, and the police pulled a man and a woman and several children to land, one by one. Carl Bailey's house and upholstery shop survived, but water rose almost waist high around his wife, Yvonne. Mrs. Bailey called to neighbors and, holding hands in the dark, half a dozen of them and Carl lifted upholstery tools and a sewing machine out of the water. Then the neighbors hoisted out Mr. Bailey and his wife. ''It was frightening,'' Mrs. Bailey said. ''Sometimes there would be a glare in the sky and you could see a little. There were car doors and light poles floating down the road and even a dead cow.'' The tin-roofed house that Mr. Bradford shares with his wife, Dawn Simms, and their three children is still standing, but the rushing water chewed into the soil at the edge of the foundation. They worry that the home may collapse. ''I feel stressed,'' Ms. Simms said. ''My head hurts. Nothing like this has ever happened here. I don't trust the house now, and we don't know what the river is going to do.''"
"Coastal geologists, meteorologists and other experts have long warned Floridians not to rely on the relatively placid weather that prevailed in the last few decades, when their state grew explosively. Now the hurricane pattern is shifting, meteorologists say, and the shift has dangerous implications for the beaches -- and the coastal hotels, roads and condominiums -- on which Florida's tourism economy depends. It has been decades since Florida suffered anything like the one-two punch of Hurricanes Charley and Frances, never mind Hurricane Ivan. But if repeated storms become regular events, as they were in the 1940's and 50's, the effects are likely to be devastating, these experts say. ''People who grew up around here talk about how when they were kids they were regularly sweeping sand out of people's homes,'' said Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University, speaking of the era before the surge of development along Florida's Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Now the weather patterns of those years seem to be returning, Dr. Leatherman said. More frequent hurricanes would be a problem not only for Florida, of course. But they would be particularly worrisome there. Coastal development is heavy and its coastal elevations are low: typically five feet or less, too little to offer much protection against a hurricane storm surge. Also, many of Florida's coastal communities have relied for years on projects to pump sand onto beaches weakened by erosion, which afflicts most of the state's coast, a third of it critically, the state Department of Environmental Protection said. Erosion will accelerate as global warming causes sea levels to rise. More intense hurricane seasons will make beach replenishment, already a problem-filled and expensive proposition, even more difficult. The state's renourished beaches survived the recent hurricanes relatively well, said Richard E. Bonner, deputy district engineer for project management for the Jacksonville District of the Army Corps of Engineers, which covers Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. ''There's erosion, but of course that's what we expect,'' Mr. Bonner said. He and other coastal engineers often describe renourished beaches as ''sacrificial'': designed to protect buildings behind them, even as they erode. But in places on Florida's east coast, Mr. Bonner said, Hurricane Frances has left beaches with what geologists call their winter profile, the shape they have after harsh winter weather has eroded them, and before gentle summer weather carries sand back on shore. As a result, these beaches will be more vulnerable to northeasters, winter storms that typically cause even more erosion than hurricanes. Mr. Bonner and other experts said the effects on beaches from the recent storms were more widespread on the east coast of Florida than on the west. Hurricane Charley, which made landfall on the west coast on Aug. 13, was stronger -- a Category 4 hurricane on the 1-to-5 Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity -- but it was quite small and it moved fast. So its damage was concentrated, and much of it occurred on stretches of beach with relatively little development. Hurricane Frances, though only a Category 2 when it struck the east coast on Sept. 4, was a sprawling storm that, as Mr. Bonner put it, ''hung around for a couple of days and beat the heck out of us.'' In places where beaches were already weakened by erosion, Mr. Bonner said, dunes were cut and sand washed over onto roads behind the beach. In places, it even washed onto the main road along the barrier islands that line Florida's east coast. Although Mr. Bonner said he was not yet convinced that weather patterns had changed, he said communities that did not replenish their beaches would lose them as rising seas moved in on shoreward structures like seawalls and revetments. But beach renourishment projects can cost tens of millions of dollars and require constant maintenance. ''It's a long-term commitment,'' said Dr. Abby Sallenger, an oceanographer at the United States Geological Survey in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''Once you start it, if you get hit by a series of storms in rapid succession you may have to replenish sooner than you thought. It's very expensive.'' Florida towns are already arguing over shoals and other offshore sand supplies and going as far afield as the Bahamas to obtain sand for beach building. Dr. Leatherman said the city of Hollywood was even considering adding smooth ground glass to replenishment sand. ''They are running out of good supplies of sand; that's no secret,'' he said. Mr. Bonner said the corps of engineers was considering using sand from inland sources to nourish beaches. Plenty of people say it would be better if Floridians had not built so many of their homes, hotels and businesses right on the beach. But no one thinks they will remove them any time soon, regardless of weather patterns. In fact, although data on reconstruction after disasters is relatively slim, research suggests that people not only replace buildings destroyed in natural disasters, but they also tend to rebuild them bigger and better, said Dennis S. Mileti, former director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado and author of the 1999 book ''Disasters by Design.'' ''Unless there is total destruction, which there rarely is, buildings that are undamaged are an impetus to rebuild stuff that is already gone,'' Dr. Mileti said. ''One of the biggest constraints to relocation after disasters is that not everything is damaged.'' There may be calls for stiffer construction standards and other efforts to mitigate future damage, but some experts say that this kind of effort, along with loans and other disaster relief programs, only encourages more building. One problem, Dr. Mileti said, is that people and political systems do not cope well with what he calls ''high consequence/low probability'' events. ''It's what has us walk across the street even though we know people get hit by cars,'' he said. ''The average person cannot take on worrying about or making very salient for themselves a high consequence/low probability event.'' Also, he and other experts say, public attention turns to problems like coastal development just after disasters like hurricanes, but the focus is on individuals and their needs rather than policy changes like relocation incentives and setback requirements that would take people out of harm's way. In any event, many experts say, efforts to mitigate the effects of natural hazards can never make a place like the coast of Florida completely safe. ''Mitigation has limited applications,'' Dr. Mileti said, and may have the unintended consequence of making people feel safer than they really are. Max H. Bazerman, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, describes the situation in Florida as a ''predictable surprise'' -- a problem anyone can see develop but no one wants to confront. Dr. Bazerman and his co-author, Michael Watkins, discuss the phenomenon in their book ''Predictable Surprises,'' to be published this month. Dr. Bazerman said he doubted that people even considered hurricanes when they moved to the Florida coast. ''I think the more likely story,'' he said, ''is that people sort of want to build on the ocean and they don't even think about those risks. We have limited awareness of factors that we don't want to bring into consideration.'' The weather in recent weeks ''doesn't mean we should abandon Florida,'' Dr. Mileti said. Instead, he and other experts say, Floridians should build -- or rebuild -- ''in ways that are consistent with the forces of nature,'' basically by keeping high-density development off the beach. But for that to happen, they say, it will be necessary to draw the public's attention to the issue, not when emotions are running high in the aftermath of a storm, but later, when local and state agencies consider development proposals and master plans. The problem, Dr. Leatherman said, is that with a few exceptions, like the theme parks around Orlando, the state's economic base is concentrated on the coast. ''The real value is packed along the shoreline, and the magnet is the beaches,'' he said. ''And this is hurricane alley.''"
"For a mayor still barely able to reach the most damaged sections of his city, David L. Bodenhamer remains remarkably upbeat about the long-term fallout from Hurricane Ivan's landfall last week in his low-lying coastal community. ''No house down here sold for less than a million a week ago,'' Mr. Bodenhamer, who coincidentally is also a real estate agent, said, pointing to the once neat row of stilted luxury beachfront condominiums that now resembles a crumbled and occasionally toothless grin. ''For the houses down here that are upright, you could now get them for less than a million, but not by much.'' Figuring out which houses are upright enough for habitation will take time. The mayor and City Council have spent all their time coordinating the distribution of emergency food and water to residents made homeless. The only efforts to protect property have involved clearing debris for traffic and fending off looters. Earthmovers have piled sand into mile-long 20-foot-tall heaps along roads that are deserted apart from patrols by National Guard members who briefly raised their M-16's at one resident whom they took for a looter. The buildings safe enough for rescue workers to enter have been certified with spray-paint symbols that signify no bodies were found inside. Concrete dangles from foundations, and long sections of sewer pipes are exposed. A wheel-spinning ride down the beach in a four-wheel-drive truck with the mayor, a City Council member and another real estate agent brings alive the story of how Gulf Shores turned the devastation of a previous hurricane into a decades-long building boom. Pounding into Gulf Shores 25 years and 3 days before Hurricane Ivan, Hurricane Frederic wiped out a large segment of the single-family houses on an island that was little known even in Alabama. ''In many ways, it was Hurricane Frederic that first put us on the map,'' Mr. Bodenhamer said. ''People learned about our great coastline, and the people wanting condominiums started arriving.'' The first post-Frederic wave of construction was mainly driven by people who lived a short distance from the coast. The permanent population swelled, from less than 2,000 before Hurricane Frederic to more than 3,000 in the early 90's, when groups from Midwestern states, so-called snowbirds, began arriving in large numbers in the cold months in the north. A line from one local song goes, ''If it's snowbird season, why can't we shoot them?'' They sent real estate prices in a climb that continued through the post-Sept. 11 slowdown felt by many beach resorts. ''People always feel very safe down here,'' Mr. Bodenhamer said. ''We may have developed, but we have never lost that local feel.'' That feel is most evident in the restaurants, Mr. Bodenhamer said, all of which are family run, apart from Hooters. Chuck Norwood, the other real estate agent on the tour, pointed to the first sites he sold, battered adjoining wood houses on stilts on the shore. ''I was in seventh heaven in 1992 selling those lots for $235,000 and $238,500,'' Mr. Norwood said. ''But that was just the beginning. I think that Ivan will make a lot of people who hesitated eager to sell or rebuild something new.'' The post-Ivan construction will likely take the island into a new and sturdier level of construction, said Gregg Kennedy, the City Council member who was driving the truck. Mr. Kennedy is a general contractor. ''Just about every other bulkhead on the beach fell during Hurricane Danny, apart from mine,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''People will build stronger and bigger because they now know this is the right place.'' Although Hurricane Ivan may drive up redevelopment here, the trend, plans and support were firmly in place before the storm, said Ernie Smith, the Gulf Shores director of economic development. ''Ivan may move the schedule up some, but we already had ourselves a plan,'' Mr. Smith said, displaying the map of a vast retail complex intended for construction near the island. ''We intend on developing smart and nice, not like Myrtle Beach, where you can't see the beach for the concrete.'' In addition to the 66-acre shopping center, the airport recently extended its runway to accept larger corporate jets, and there are plans to lengthen the Boardwalk along the beach. Zoning laws, which limit every lot to no more than 42 condominium units, will most likely lead to the building of narrow buildings that do not block sea views and encourage walking, Mr. Smith said. ''We have planned for the kind of beach resort where you spend all day on the beach, not stuck in traffic jams,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Ivan has accelerated our transformation from Redneck Riviera into a true top-notch Gulf Coast resort.'' Such changes do not sit well with all residents. ''Ivan just finished what Frederic started, and I must say I find that sad,'' said Clayton Wallace, editor of The Islander, a twice-a-week newspaper here. ''Look around you right now, because -- bless it -- this mess is the last of the old Gulf Shores.'' Living on a plot purchased by his great-great-grandfather in 1861 with Confederate cash -- the seller unsuccessfully sued for further payment after the Civil War -- Mr. Wallace worries that Gulf Shores will soon lose its soul. ''Looks like the Pink Pony Pub may survive, but it's possible Nolan's bar and the gumbo shop will be condemned,'' he said. ''If they go, that will be the end of this sleepy coastal town as it turns into just another row of condos on the gulf.'' For Mr. Wallace and other long-term residents, Ivan brought odd moments of déja vù. ''Twenty-five years after Frederic ruined my birthday by stopping me from getting my driver's license for three weeks, Ivan ruins my birthday by wrecking our house -- now my house -- again,'' Mr. Wallace said, adding that the heights of the storm surges were virtually identical. ''The pine needles we left in bathroom door jams from Frederic are at the same height as the stains from Ivan.'' The biggest difference between the storms has been the aftermath, Mr. Wallace said. ''Last time, we had to walk across the bridge to pick up ice from the seafood plant, and there was no Salvation Army,'' he said. ''This time, we have the National Guard all over the place, and people handing out truckloads of food and ice.'' Walter Norton, also a lifelong resident, said the similarities in the damage to his family's house from the two storms were striking. ''When you stand back and compare what happened, there is an almost eerie similarity in the damage,'' Mr. Norton said. ''We are planning to take photographs to compare.'' He said the storm might prompt his family to rebuild, but it will not be out of choice. ''We just hope the insurance does not condemn us, because then we would be forced to build up on stilts,'' Mr. Norton said. ''We are not like the real estate developers. It would cost us money that we don't want to spend.''"
"The Alabama and Florida beaches damaged in recent hurricanes will naturally recover at least somewhat, coastal scientists say. But how fast and to what extent they can regain their prestorm shape depend on highly variable factors: the damage, how much they already suffer from chronic erosion and how densely they have been developed. ''It's always the case that there's substantial recovery,'' said Spencer Rogers, a specialist in shoreline processes and coastal construction at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington. ''The question is how much.'' Many coastal communities need the protection of beaches and cannot afford simply to hope that nature will eventually restore what was lost in the storms, said Paden Woodruff, environmental administrator at the Bureau of Beaches and Coastal Systems of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Mr. Woodruff said the agency already had ''assisted recovery'' plans to move sand onto beaches weakened by Hurricane Charley and would make plans for areas affected by Hurricanes Frances and Ivan as well. He added that it was too soon to know where those efforts would be needed or what they would cost. ''It will be a significant effort,'' he said. ''We have a lot of miles of shoreline that have been affected.'' Similar recovery programs after Hurricane Opal, which struck the Florida Panhandle in 1995, cost more than $30 million, Mr. Woodruff said. Storms damage beaches by carrying sand offshore and inland. Some of the offshore sand ends up in or near the surf zone. During calm weather, gentle waves can pick it up and move it back onto the beach. This kind of recovery is already under way, the scientists said, especially in areas that were not plagued by erosion. Sometimes, though, storm waves send sand far offshore, into deep water where wave action cannot reach it. Then it is lost unless someone recaptures it and returns it to shore. More is lost when waves or storm surges carry sand inland. Dr. Abby Sallenger, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey in St. Petersburg, Fla., said Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan did not produce the extreme overwash seen when Hurricane Andrew struck the Louisiana coast in 1992, stripping all the sand off some barrier island beaches and dumping it into the lagoons behind them. But some of the islands struck by Hurricane Ivan ''were really beaten very low and were awash,'' Dr. Sallenger said. On natural beaches, this overwash is a benign process, one way beaches retreat inland to defend themselves against rising sea levels. By moving sand inland, ''storms don't destroy the beach, they just move the beach,'' said Dr. David M. Bush, a geologist at the State University of West Georgia and an author of the 2001 book ''Living on the Edge of the Gulf.'' That is why the undeveloped stretch of beach area near Eglin Air Force Base, about 40 miles east of Pensacola, Fla., ''will probably recover fine,'' Dr. Bush said, even though it was overwashed. But on developed beaches, overwash is a big problem. Beachfront condominiums, hotels and roads, for instance, cannot shift inland with the sand, which piles up in streets, yards and even the ground-floor rooms of buildings. Typically, it is carted off and dumped inland, more sand lost from the beach. Mr. Woodruff said some communities might be allowed to use this sand to replenish storm-damaged beaches. But sand overwashed in hurricanes is often filled with dangerous debris, he said, so it would have to be stockpiled and sifted before being applied to a beach. Meanwhile, he said, Florida would turn to its inventory of inland sources of sand that could be carted onto beaches. This, along with sand bulldozed or scraped from the beach itself, will be used to build new dunes. But artificial dunes do not offer the protection of natural dunes. Natural dunes form when a sprig of beach grass, for instance, traps windblown sand. ''The vegetation baffles the wind and induces sand to fall out around the vegetation,'' Dr. Sallenger said. The movement of the sand grains creates layers that combine to form hard, closely packed sand. Walk on an artificial dune, he said, and ''you'll sink up to your calves; it doesn't offer the protection of a natural dune.'' But he added, ''It takes awhile to build up a decent dune.''"
"Residents of towns along the Delaware River who were forced from their homes by flooding over the weekend started returning on Monday, while New Jersey officials assessed the damage to see if the state would be eligible for federal aid. By Monday afternoon, the river had receded below flood stage at almost all points along a stretch of about 75 miles from Phillipsburg, N.J., south to Bristol, Pa. But some roads and bridges remained closed, and many residents had to spend a second night in shelters, awaiting the restoration of utilities. About 15 miles upriver of Bristol, in Trenton, where the governor's office said the flooding caused the greatest disruption, most state offices were closed, as were the city schools. Legislative committee meetings and hearings were canceled, and at the State House, workers spent the day pumping river water from the underground garage. The most serious flooding occurred about two miles farther north, in a neighborhood called the Island, where streets near the river were still slick with mud and closed off by yellow tape Monday afternoon. ''We have this gem of an island to live on, and we ran out of luck,'' Deb Roussell said as she stood in line at a nearby firehouse where she and hundreds of neighbors were signing up for permission to inspect damage to their houses. ''This hasn't happened on the Island since 1955.'' Utility workers knocked on doors about 7 p.m. Saturday to tell residents to leave by 6 a.m. Sunday. At the firehouse Monday, after the residents were called block by block, they were boarding buses to return to the neighborhood, but most would not be able to stay, officials said. The river crested Sunday evening, the National Weather Service said, a full day after rains from the remnants of Hurricane Ivan cut across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On Saturday night, Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey declared a state of emergency in four riverside counties, from Mercer north through Hunterdon, Warren and Sussex. Brian Hughes, the Mercer County executive, said about 750 people in Trenton were still without utility services Monday afternoon. About 80 spent Sunday night in a shelter at the Joseph Stokes Memorial School, which will remain open until at least Tuesday, Mr. Hughes said. Another lingering problem, Mr. Hughes said, was a loss of water pressure in Trenton, as the surge in the river impeded the city's water intake. He said the county offices closed at noon because the upper floors had no running water. As worries about the flooding rose on Sunday, emergency officials removed more than 200 residents from the Water's Edge nursing home in Trenton, using 58 ambulances to take them to hospitals and shelters. Most of the residents were returned Monday, Mr. Hughes said, and there was no serious damage to the building. Officials in New Jersey and in Bucks County, Pa., across the river from Trenton, said no deaths or serious injuries had been reported."
"Hurricane Ivan hammered the Cayman Islands on Sunday with winds that moved like bulldozers at 155 miles per hour, as thousands of people in Cuba and Florida braced for one of the most powerful storms to boil up out of the Atlantic. Ahead of the storm, Cuba, the most populated island in the Caribbean, evacuated nearly one million people to shelters and moved truckloads of food into fortified warehouses. President Fidel Castro spent more than two hours Saturday night on state television with high-ranking military officers and civil defense officials to inform people about the hurricane's magnitude and course. They said they expected the storm to hit the western tip of the island, known for producing some of the highest quality cigars in the world. But, Mr. Castro said in the address, ''The country is prepared for this hurricane.'' In Florida residents of the Keys expressed relief that forecasters now expected the hurricane to skirt to the west, bypassing them and charging up the Gulf of Mexico to the Panhandle region of the state. But Jimmy Weekley, the mayor of Key West, said he was holding firm to his mandatory evacuation order. ''My gut feeling is that if this storm takes just a little wobble toward the east, it could be right back here,'' Mr. Weekley said Sunday afternoon. On Sunday, Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency. Over the last week, Hurricane Ivan left a trail of death and destruction during its slow march past Grenada, Venezuela and Jamaica. The authorities say Hurricane Ivan is the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. At least 65 people have been reported killed, and the authorities expect that number to rise. On Sunday, Hurricane Ivan, a Category 5 storm, battered the Cayman Islands, tearing roofs and uprooting trees three stories tall. By the time the hurricane's eye was trained toward this island, some 90 miles south of Florida, Cubans had begun calling it Ivan the Terrible. More than 800,000 people have been evacuated from low-lying areas, the official Prensa Latina news agency reported. But Hurricane Ivan has a long reach. And the authorities predicted its churning outer winds would wreak havoc across the rest of the island. ''Cuba will be ready,'' Mr. Castro, wearing his signature fatigues, said in his television address on Saturday night to this nation of 11 million people. The storm is the second to hit Cuba in a month. The coastal highway between Havana and Mariel is still littered with telephone poles, billboard and electricity towers toppled by Hurricane Charley in mid-August. ''The last storm took my roof,'' said Iraimie Reyes, sitting on the concrete floor of a government-run shelter. ''This time, I expect it to take my house. I don't expect to have anything but the clothes I am wearing when this is over.'' In Miami, officials at the National Hurricane Center said that Cuba could be hit especially hard by Hurricane Ivan. Meteorologists examined glowing orange and red blobs on satellite images showing that sea temperatures between the storm and Cuba were among the warmest in the Caribbean, well above 80 degrees. Those conditions would feed energy into the hurricane and could easily make it a Category 5 monster when it struck, they said. ''It's going to be a panorama of desolation,'' said Rafael Mojica, a hurricane expert at the center. He said that Guam was about the only place on earth with building codes sufficiently stringent to endure a worst-case hurricane. Cuba has seen a string of strong storms in the last few years, after a dearth of hurricanes for several decades. The flat land along Cuba's southwestern coast means that the tidal surge pushed by such a storm would add to the destruction from winds that can make such a hurricane's wake ''like that of a thousand tornadoes,'' Mr. Mojica said. At 11 p.m. on Sunday, the center of Hurricane Ivan was 175 miles southeast of the western tip of Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center. It had maximum sustained winds of 160 m.p.h., with higher gusts. If the storm stays on its current track, its center is expected to pass near or over the western end of Cuba on Monday afternoon or evening, the Hurricane Center said. Hurricane-force winds extend outward from the storm's center for 90 miles and tropical-storm-force winds for 200 miles The hurricane began battering Grand Cayman Island, the main island in the group, on Sunday morning, flooding homes, ripping off roofs and toppling trees and power lines. ''We know there is damage, and it is severe,'' Wes Emanuel, a Cayman government spokesman, told The Associated Press while the islands were under siege. In a telephone interview with the news agency from a fifth-floor building in George Town, the capital of the Cayman Islands, Justin Uzzell, 35, said in the middle of the hurricane: ''It's as bad as it can possibly get.'' ''It's a horizontal blizzard,'' Mr. Uzzell said. ''The air is just foam.'' Government officials in the Cayman Islands said they were worried that the hurricane's drenching rains would touch off mudslides, just as they did earlier in Jamaica. In Jamaica the authorities said mudslides were expected to continue in the central hills and mountains for several days as sporadic heavy rain continued. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson of Jamaica met with emergency officials at his offices in the white-washed Jamaica House on Sunday afternoon to get their assessments of damage after a flyover by helicopter and examinations by boat and car of remote areas. Mr. Patterson said he was holding off on a damage estimate until he could meet with his cabinet on Monday. In Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, some houses and businesses lost roofs, and a few had shattered windows, but the most widespread impact of the hurricane appeared to be fallen trees and power lines. Throughout the city on Sunday, homeowners were clearing debris from their yards Sunday, repairing roofs and putting away shutters and plywood covering. Though the wreckage on much of the island consists of uprooted trees and ripped-off roofs and awnings, government officials cautioned that they were getting reports of some pockets of heavy damage. Emergency officials said they had no reports from two parishes, the rough equivalent of counties in the United States, and were worried that serious damages might have occurred in those places. One of them was Westmoreland on the western tip of Jamaica, where Negril, one of the main resort towns, is situated. The other is the parish of St. Elizabeth on Jamaica's south coast, which took the brunt of Hurricane Ivan's powerful winds. By late Sunday afternoon, Jamaica's skies were generally clear, and much of the country was returning to normal. Electricity was restored to parts of Kingston and officials said other parts of the country would be getting power shortly. The airport in Montego Bay resumed operations Sunday, but the airport in Kingston remained closed because the road to the airport was still under water. In Jamaica, at least 15 people have been killed. In one neighborhood in the southern-most knob of Jamaica, Portland Point, eight people drowned in storm surges and north of Kingston, a father and three children died in a mudslide that buried them in their home."
"Florida's nerve endings, like an inconstant radio dial, are tuned to two overlapping frequencies right now -- the easy listening music of everyday life and the emergency broadcast system. With a third powerful hurricane bearing down on Florida within a month, thousands of residents spent the weekend uncertain whether, when or where to flee. In areas like Tampa and Clearwater, which two days ago seemed to be in the bull's-eye of Hurricane Ivan's track but are now less likely targets, people went to church or to the beach or sipped cappuccino outside a boarded-up Starbucks as if it were a normal Sunday. But motorists' eyes were trained on gas stations to see if plastic bags covered the nozzles at the pumps -- the universally understood signal for ''no gas.'' Wal-Marts in the area had trouble meeting the demand for five-gallon gas cans. In the Mariner's Cove trailer park in Clearwater, Eddie Caballer and his wife, Glenda Vidal, along with her brother Sam Vidal, had decided what they would do if Hurricane Ivan turned back east. ''If it's a Category 3, we leave the trailer and stay in Pinellas County'' at Sam Vidal's home, Glenda Vidal said. ''If it's a 4 or a 5, we head out for Orlando.'' Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on Sunday, but his sober reminder of Hurricane Ivan's strength seemed at odds with the quiet sighs of relief heard along the western coast of the state. Still, many residents -- after witnessing the fury of Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances over the last several weeks -- were not taking chances. ''My boyfriend doesn't want to stay,'' said Debbie Cobrusso, a Tampa resident who was at work this weekend at a convenience store in Nokomis, a coastal town 40 miles to the south. Ms. Cobrusso added, ''We've got two brand-new skylights, courtesy of Frances.'' Asked where she was headed, Ms. Cobrusso replied, ''To the opposite end of the state.'' A customer at the convenience store, who would give only his first name, Dan, nodded, saying: ''I was here for two. I'm not staying for a third. I'm going wherever it's not.'' By that definition, he could have headed almost anywhere in the central and southern areas of the state, based on the increasingly westward drift of the path meteorologists expect Hurricane Ivan to take. By Sunday evening, the hurricane was forecast to skirt the western edge of Cuba on Monday afternoon and to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday on the Florida Panhandle near Panama City. The changing forecasts brought some doubt, some relief and some frustration to residents of the Florida Keys, 60 percent of whom had evacuated since Thursday. Some watching the storm's predicted track edge westward have begun clamoring to return to their homes in the Keys, said W.A. Wagner Jr., the senior director of emergency management for Monroe County. But given the power of the storm and the risk that it could still swing east, Mr. Wagner said, he would keep the causeways shut for another day. Standing outside his chapel on Sunday, the Rev. Eugene Frame, the pastor of the Tampa First Church of the Nazarene, said: ''I've had a lot of calls. People are just frantic.'' The unpredictable course of the third, and possibly the strongest, hurricane pointed toward Florida has exacerbated the stress for people who have either evacuated twice in the last month or lived through the frightening howling of the winds. Two of Mr. Frame's parishioners, Brenda Zimmerman and Todd Wendel, stood outside the church after services on Sunday pondering how to reschedule their engagement shower. It was to be held on Tuesday but was canceled. ''When I first heard about Ivan, I freaked out,'' Ms. Zimmerman said. ''And I was disappointed because I knew the shower was gone.'' Now, she said, she is much calmer. ''After the first two have gone over, you're not going to get as upset.'' On the partially deserted island of Key West, many people were wary of the forecasters' suggestions that Hurricane Ivan was now likely to strike a glancing blow, at worst. Not for Hurricanes Charley or Frances did Key West close up as thoroughly as it did this weekend. Except for a few bars, every business downtown was closed. Duvall Street, usually bustling on a beautiful weekend afternoon, was deserted Saturday and Sunday. ''This is the first time in the history of Key West that residents have taken this so seriously,'' Julio Avael, the city manager, said in an interview. ''This time, folks are heeding the warnings.'' Most residents of Key West saw pictures of the devastation Hurricane Ivan wrought on the island of Grenada, and since then their attention has remained fixed on storm updates. All the tourists, the economic lifeblood of Key West, are gone. ''The last one checked out on Thursday,'' said Robert M. Spoto, general manager of La Concha Hotel, in the center of the tourist district. ''We are now the refuge of last resort.'' The on-again, off-again threats that the storm, now the sixth-largest ever spawned in the Atlantic basin, could hit the Gulf Coast produced a patchwork of evacuations and closings. Dozens of elderly residents at an independent living facility in Charlotte County, north of Fort Myers, whiled away the weekend in a Tampa hotel. Public schools announced they would close in at least five counties around Tampa Bay. But government offices would remain open, local officials announced."
"KEN DEANER, a financial consultant in New York City, had his heart set on buying a second home in Miami a few weeks before Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan hit. But now that real estate romance is over. ''Right now I'm not buying in Florida,'' Mr. Deaner said. The hurricanes tracked through Florida and left the home market a muddy mess. Many home shoppers have been scared off and they have plenty of company: most property insurers suspended the writing of new policies when Charley and Frances hit, and as Ivan neared. That has delayed closings, and made potential buyers even more anxious. Slowing sales even further, some mortgage lenders have put pending sales contracts on hold until the houses and condominiums they have agreed to finance can be reappraised to take possible storm damage into account. Real estate agents unrelentingly profess optimism that what was decidedly a sellers' market will return in a few months. After all, they reason, inventories around the state are low. Here in Orlando, for example, there are about 8,000 homes for sale, down 27 percent from a year ago. Yet that isn't enough to calm the storm-shaken nerves of some when it's time to sign on the dotted line. ''Everyone involved with a home sale tends to go into a panic mode when a hurricane comes,'' said Ana Sobrino, a mortgage broker in Miami. There's plenty to worry about. Hundreds of damaged homes are being pulled off the market. ''If it's missing roof shingles, I tell them to put new ones on and list it again for more money while other inventory is still being repaired,'' said Beverly Rothstein, an independent broker in the Palm Beach area. That's good advice, to fix a home and sell before the competition can pretty up again, except that roofers and other repair specialists are swamped. ''We're hearing it will take three to six months to get a roof fixed in some areas,'' said Reeta Casey, a Re/Max agent in Orlando. Meanwhile, the vultures, as Ms. Casey calls them, are flocking. They are the cash-wielding investors on the prowl for damaged property. Preying on the potentially fragile psyche of owners, they're making low-ball offers of cash. ''They phone and say: 'Hi, how are you? Would you like to sell your house today?,' '' said Dr. Christopher Scott, an emergency room physician in Orlando who owns a house for sale in Fort Myers listed at $189,000. ''Then they offer you 60 percent of what it's worth.'' His house didn't suffer much damage from Hurricane Charley, which hit Fort Myers hard, but some nearby homes did. ''I'm not really in a distressed situation with that property, or I'd be tempted to accept an offer like that,'' Dr. Scott said. He says the predatory buyers illustrate the flip side of price gouging. Many such distress shoppers are investors, looking for property to buy and fix quickly, then resell when the market picks up. ''My investors' ears have gone up since the hurricanes -- they want to find deals,'' said Kevin Tomlinson, an agent with Esslinger Wooten Maxwell Realtors in Miami Beach. His clients are so eager to buy damaged condos that last week he drove more than 200 miles north to the Vero Beach area in the search. But all that motoring around didn't yield many potential wind-damaged bargains, he said. ''There are some missing roof shingles and a lot of trees down, but I didn't see anything nearly as bad as in South Florida after Hurricane Andrew in 1992,'' he said. Ms. Casey's Re/Max office in Orlando attempts to screen those who call asking to be taken immediately on tours of hard-hit areas. ''You can usually tell who they are,'' she said. ''They want to see several homes immediately, and they don't seem to care where they are as long as they're bargains.'' That's often a tip-off that the customer will simply jot down addresses of damaged homes the broker shows, find the owners through property records and make offers so low that they aren't fair, she added. Still, with insurers and lenders nervous, there aren't many regular real estate shoppers around to give the distress shoppers much competition. ''We had one contract for an $850,000 home that fell through the day before Charley hit; the buyers decided they weren't moving to Florida after all and went back to New Jersey,'' said Hudson McMurtrie, owner of a 70-agent Re/Max office in Orlando near the Universal Studios theme park. Some buyers may have second thoughts anyway, he said, but having a hurricane bearing down on you right before closing is the worst-case scenario. Even when the hurricanes are past, it is not easy to show houses in the ravaged areas. Brokers may be able to persuade buyers to tour a house, but then it might flunk the sniff test. That's because mold and mildew are rampant because of leaky roofing, windows and doors. ''The smell is a constant reminder to people that water came into this house because of a hurricane,'' said Cindy Rosenbloom, one of Mr. McMurtrie's agents. Another drawback for home sellers: many who boarded up windows to protect them from storms are still afraid to uncover them for fear of yet another hurricane. Trying to cope, Sherry McMurtrie, Mr. McMurtrie's daughter and an agent at his firm, showed a boarded-up house to a potential buyer last week. ''I found myself in the middle of the day with clients in this dark living room and saying, 'Now normally there's a lot of wonderful natural light here,' '' she said. ''Those buyers are still thinking about that house, probably trying to imagine what the living room looks like with the windows unboarded.'' Other shoppers must visualize what many houses look like without stacks of tree limbs and other debris several feet high and wide at the edge of the front yards, a scene common across Central Florida. This felled-tree phenomenon has hit many of the pricey older established neighborhoods hardest because they have -- or had -- the huge mossy oaks and other shade trees that can be such a comfort to homeowners during Florida's blazing hot summers. But now a visit to these areas often reveals trees poking down through a roof here and there, or resting on cars that were left outside in driveways during the storms. Escaping the worst of such scenes are the newer subdivisions, often built on former cow pastures or citrus groves, that are heavily landscaped close to the ground but haven't much of a natural skyline except for a few stubborn and relatively stubby palms. ''First we lose a lot of vegetation and then what's left of it won't go away,'' said David Cramer, another Re/Max broker in Orlando. Municipal trash haulers are too overwhelmed to remove much of the dead brush, and by some estimates the rotting piles may be around for the rest of 2004. Not only does all this detract from the appearance of homes, but buyers may want to avoid the wildlife being attracted to mini-nature preserves heaped at the curb. Rats, snakes and spiders are moving into the refuse. ''Yech,'' said Jody Dempsey, a Re/Max agent in Orlando. ''Many of the critters have been driven out of their usual habitat by the storms. You want to walk way around the stuff when you show a house.'' An estimated 50,000 Australian pine trees were felled by Hurricanes Charley and Frances on Sanibel and Captiva Islands, according to Steve Greenstein, executive director of the Sanibel-Captiva Islands Chamber of Commerce. ''Just the stump of a big pine can fill almost an entire dump truck,'' he said. ''One tree, one truckload, so you can see how much we have to get rid of.'' The mounds of erstwhile greenery are unsightly, though impermanent. Still, they contribute to a national image of Florida property damage that real estate agents insist is portrayed as worse than it really is. ''It seems like television showed the same ripped-up trailer from every possible angle,'' said Michael Saunders, owner of a 150-agent firm in Sarasota that carries her name. She said one potential buyer recently asked, ''Do you sell anything besides mobile homes?'' Actually, Ms. Saunders's staff lists and shows exclusively site-built homes. But even in the case of concrete-block houses, she said, some buyers want post-hurricane re-inspections of homes before they will go through with the purchase. Nonetheless, she said, her firm sold a home on the beach of the Gulf of Mexico priced at just under $6 million a few days after Hurricane Frances passed. The beach is still there and the homes on it have proved they can survive, she said. Maybe, but Mr. Deaner, the financial consultant from New York who is now too wary of the winds to buy a Florida home, said he may shop in Arizona. ''We'll still take vacations to Florida, but not during the June-to-December hurricane season,'' he said. ''We just don't want to be committed there year-round.'' Ms. Dempsey, however, said the hurricane damage and danger are exaggerated in the minds of out-of-state buyers. ''We get plain old thunderstorms sometimes that are as bad as Hurricane Frances,'' she said. That may not be a strong selling pitch. NATIONAL PERSPECTIVES"
"When three sisters in the same state are hit by three hurricanes in five weeks, the fourth sister might understandably worry as another storm moves north from the Caribbean. ''This month my three sisters and I played hurricane phone tag,'' said Sharon Stallwort, a resident of Pensacola who lost a car, sections of roof and a cement basketball court to Hurricane Ivan this week. ''Our other sister Melissa in Virginia is convinced that this next storm is headed for her.'' Their sister Gail Tayne in Miami continues to live without electricity after a tree slammed into her roof during Hurricane Charley five weeks ago. Up in Jacksonville, their sister Andrea Ward is repairing windows blown out of her car and apartment by Hurricane Frances two weeks ago. ''I'd like to go out and buy me a lottery ticket,'' Ms. Stallwort said. ''But the shops is all knocked out and I spend my day waiting in line for water to drink.'' As residents along the East Coast reel from damage delivered by the remnants of Hurricane Ivan, Florida hurricane victims and aid workers say that three hurricanes in rapid succession have left them battered, stunned and exhausted. Adding to the pain, Hurricane Ivan wrecked roads and bridges and broke a sewer system serving a third of the Pensacola area's 300,000 residents. Estimates suggest that it most likely damaged more homes than either of the previous two storms. ''Ivan hit Florida with the intensity of Charley on a Frances scale,'' said Mike Stone, spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management. ''Charley was strong, and Frances wide, but Ivan was both.'' Adding to the woes caused by the hurricane, there have been 72 cases of looting and 18 arrests in Escambia County, home to Pensacola, in addition to reports of gas siphoning and pitched battles over supplies. A fight over ice and water in Pensacola on Friday night in a Big Lots parking lot involved more than 100 people and required 20 sheriff's deputies and a dozen members of a SWAT team to break up, said Eugene Jackson, a deputy in the Escambia Sheriff's Department. ''The selfishness of a food riot is shameful,'' Deputy Jackson said. ''There were busted noses, bleeding cuts and a fair share of bruises by the end of it.'' Charlie Gaynor, a private in the National Guard who is distributing ice in Pensacola, said the long hours distracted him from thinking about how his uncle's home in Punta Gorda was washed away by Hurricane Charley. ''Seems like every other week we get activated for a hurricane,'' Mr. Gaynor said. ''It's getting to be a lot like that film 'Groundhog Day.''' For James Hookins of the Salvation Army unit in Port Richey, north of Tampa Bay, driving his white soup-kitchen truck to serve victims of all three hurricanes has been an education on many levels. ''When soup trucks gather together from as far as Chicago, we sometimes have time to trade tips,'' Mr. Hookins said. ''Last night this guy showed me a great idea for using wire shelves above the serving window.'' The greatest innovation has been bolting a commercial can opener to the inside of the truck. ''Opening 100 No. 10 cans with a hand opener just about broke my arm during Charley,'' Mr. Hookins said. ''It may seem like a small thing to you, but a good opener is a lifesaver.'' Mr. Hookins has fed thousands of victims over the last five weeks on a menu of beef barbecue, chicken dumplings, stew, hot dogs, sloppy Joes and spaghetti. ''When we have three trucks out in the same spot, the long lines always run to the one serving spaghetti,'' Mr. Hookins said. ''It's kind of frustrating because boiling all that water makes it hard work.'' Another lesson he said he learned was to avoid working with new Salvation Army recruits. ''You just can't send green people out into the middle of a disaster,'' Mr. Hookins said. ''They don't even know how to turn on a generator.'' Some storm victims reflected on recent offers of support they offered to friends and relatives affected by hurricanes in other parts of the state. ''Just a few weeks ago I consoled my friend Denise about the damage Charley caused her house in Miami,'' said Tiffany Perry, a resident of Pensacola who described how the hurricane had destroyed her horse barn and sent trees through the living room and bedroom ceilings. ''Life is just so strange. So strange.'' -------------------- Storm Moves Through Northeast WHEELING, W.Va., Sept. 18 (AP) -- As the broad area of rain that remained from Hurricane Ivan streamed off through New England, the National Weather Service predicted the Ohio River would crest Sunday at 46 feet, about 10 feet above flood stage and close to its record. On Saturday, President Bush declared disaster areas in Georgia and North Carolina, where the storm and its remnants caused heavy flooding in some areas and at least 12 of the 45 deaths in the United States. Utility companies said more than 1.3 million homes and businesses still had no power on Saturday from Florida to Pennsylvania."
"LONG before Hurricane Ivan began bearing down on the Gulf Coast last week, a special breed of money managers was carefully tracking its development. The managers monitored its intensity, searching for any sign that it might veer toward Florida's major coastal cities. They consulted forecasts from the National Hurricane Center in Miami and the Met Office in Britain. They scanned water temperature readings from ocean buoys and ran sophisticated computer models to try to predict the storm's likely course and to estimate the damage. Then they went hunting for cats. No, not the furry variety. The interest-bearing kind. Cat bonds, short for catastrophe bonds, are little-known securities through which investors bet on hurricanes, earthquakes and even terrorist attacks. Insurance companies issue them to help pay excess claims from such events. Most of the bonds are intended to protect insurers from disasters that happen once or maybe twice in a century, the sort they might otherwise have trouble covering. Cat bonds pay unusually high interest rates -- between 5 and 15 percent annually, depending on the bond -- which is part of what makes them attractive to hedge funds and other institutional investors. But they are also somewhat riskier than other bonds: if the insured losses from a catastrophe exceed a certain threshold, the bondholders could lose their investments. When cat bonds were developed after Hurricane Andrew devastated the insurance industry in 1992, some people predicted that they would revolutionize the way insurance companies handled risk, ultimately eliminating the need for reinsurance. That has not happened. Most insurance companies still lay off risk by buying traditional reinsurance, which is cheaper and can be arranged on shorter notice than a bond issue. But cat bonds continue to be issued. When it comes to hurricanes, the trading of these bonds, and the computer models that investors watch, can provide insights into the kind of damage a storm might cause. That information is crucial for the insurance industry and its investors -- and, ultimately, it could help people in a hurricane's path, as well as emergency agencies, to be better prepared. Last year, $1.73 billion in new cat bonds were issued in eight transactions, according to Guy Carpenter & Company, a tracking firm, and its affiliate, MMC Securities. At the end of 2003, about $4 billion in cat bond debt was outstanding worldwide, about $1.3 billion of it relating to North Atlantic hurricane risk. The bonds are held by 100 to 200 investors, all large institutions or hedge funds with a high tolerance for risk. ''There are no widows and orphans investing in these bonds,'' said Christopher McGhee, head of investment banking for MMC Securities, which helps companies issue cat bonds. The bonds trade over the counter and through private transactions. For those who follow cat bonds, these have been hectic weeks. For the first time since 1964, Florida has been hit by three hurricanes in a year -- and the season is not yet over. ''It's been a rough month; let's put it that way,'' said James Doona, a director in the insurance capital markets area at Standard & Poor's. Mr. Doona and his colleagues decide whether to downgrade cat bonds -- most of which are issued with BB, or marginal, ratings -- if it appears that a storm may trip their triggers and wipe out bondholders. Despite some nervous moments, S.&P. has not issued any downgrades. The triggers are not easy to trip; according to insurance trackers, most of the bonds have an expected loss of less than 0.8 percent a year. It would take something like a Category 5 hurricane scoring a direct hit against Miami or Tampa, an event that might cause more than $15 billion in insured losses, to force bondholders to surrender their principal. Hurricane Charley, which skirted Orlando, looked as if it might cause this sort of damage, but initial insurance claims now put insured losses from that storm at $6.8 billion. Estimates of the damage caused by Hurricane Frances range from $3 billion to $10 billion, according to various catastrophe-modeling firms that work with the industry. Most of the bonds have four-year maturities and have triggers tied to one event. A few are issued for one year, and some of these have triggers that cover multiple events -- meaning that they could be set off by several smaller hurricanes, rather than one big storm. Still, even these, while not exactly Treasury notes, have been relatively safe bets for investors. For instance, the insurer USAA bought reinsurance from an offshore entity called Residential Re that issued $160 million in three-year hurricane and earthquake notes last year. The notes have a trigger that is tripped if the carrier sustains more than $653 million in claims -- beyond its other existing reinsurance -- from any number of events. So far, USAA estimates that it has sustained at most $260 million in insured losses from Hurricanes Frances and Charley -- meaning that it could endure much more damage from Ivan and other storms before bondholders have to worry. ''To my knowledge, there has never been a payment on a cat bond to date,'' said Howard Kunreuther, co-director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''It's not as if a lot of people have lost money on these things.'' Investors are aware of that, which is why hurricane bonds trade mostly at par, or face value, if they trade at all. (Investors like to hold on to them to earn those outsize interest payments.) But when major storms approach the East Coast, nervous investors may start unloading cat bonds for less, and hedge funds often begin trolling for bargains. Hedge fund managers reported bonds trading lower as Hurricanes Charley and Frances neared landfall. (Prices were down about 10 percent for Charley and 20 percent for Frances.) As Ivan approached, some hedge fund managers were eager for more trades. ''We would have thought the activity would have been greater early in the week as Ivan approached,'' said Greg Hagood, co-founder of Nephila Capital, a hedge fund in Bermuda that specializes in cat bonds. By the time Ivan made landfall, however, little trading was taking place. ''The general sense is that if there were nervous sellers, they sold in Frances and Charley already,'' said Mr. McGhee of MMC Securities. Another factor was that only a few hurricane bonds are linked to property outside of Florida. When Ivan turned west, toward Alabama, bondholders breathed easier. Though Ivan would cause much damage in the Florida Panhandle, the property values there are lower than in southern Florida. But how do investors know if buying hurricane bonds is really a good risk? The answer lies in the catastrophe-modeling software developed for insurers and now used by cat bond investors. These models use meteorology, engineering and underwriting data to create real-time color maps of estimated damage. Most include information from every recorded tropical storm back to the late 1890's, detailed information on building construction and the effects of various wind speeds on different kinds of structures. They also include information on how property is insured -- applying, for instance, deductibles and policy limits. ''We can go right down to the level of a city block on the coast in modeling the risk,'' said Robert Muir-Wood, head of research at RMS, a catastrophe-modeling company in Newark, Calif. Emergency agencies have begun to use the same modeling simulations to plan for possible hurricane damage. And the catastrophe-modeling firms often release alerts on damage estimates. DESPITE their sophistication, the models are not perfect -- particularly in forecasting how storms will behave as they come onshore. ''No one would have forecast Charley would be at Category 4 at landfall when it was only Category 2 a few hours before,'' Mr. Muir-Wood said. The catastrophe-modeling companies now send teams of wind engineers to survey the damage immediately after hurricanes pass, and use the information they gather to improve their software. ''There is no question that this marketplace could not exist if we did not have sophisticated natural-disaster models,'' Mr. McGhee of MMC Securities said. ''And the models are just getting better all the time.'' Of course, the hedge fund managers who use these models had better hope that they don't become too good. If everyone knows exactly what a hurricane is going to do, there will be no reason to trade. NEWS AND ANALYSIS Correction: October 3, 2004, Sunday An article on Sept. 19 about catastrophe bonds, used by insurers to cover disaster risks like those from hurricanes, referred incorrectly to Guy Carpenter & Company, a source of data about the value of those issued last year. The company is a reinsurance broker, not a tracking firm."
"The remnants of Hurricane Ivan sloshed into New York City and environs yesterday, shutting down large patches of the city's subway system, causing New Jersey to declare a state of emergency in four counties and threatening to flood rivers as far north as Sullivan County, N.Y. Hundreds of weekend riders were inconvenienced as service on several Manhattan subway lines was suspended for a few hours yesterday morning. The 1, 2 and 3 lines were shut down from Times Square to 96th Street because of flooding from 9:40 a.m. to about noon, said Paul J. Fleuranges, a New York City Transit spokesman. The 4, 5 and 6 lines from Grand Central Terminal to 125th Street were also closed from roughly 9 a.m. to noon, Mr. Fleuranges said. Mr. Fleuranges said that the F train from Jay Street in Brooklyn to 34th Street was temporarily shut down because of burning insulation on some track equipment at the West Fourth Street station. One frustrated commuter, having suffered through suspension of the F train, bellowed in the subway car, ''This service stinks!'' When the F was then suddenly shifted to the tracks of the A train, he buried his head in his hands and groaned. By 10 a.m. yesterday, 2.25 inches of rain had fallen in New York City, said Geoff Cornish, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. The heaviest rainfall was between 8 and 9 a.m., he said, when 1.15 inches was recorded in Central Park. The downpour was caused by the tail end of Ivan's warm moist air pushing northeast from the Southern states and colliding with a cold front that was already hovering in the region, Mr. Cornish said. He said that the cold front would most likely bring chilly winds today that could gust up to 20 or 30 miles per hour in New York. ''It will really feel like autumn,'' he said. One of the hardest hit areas in the region was Sullivan County, about 90 miles north of New York City, which declared a state of emergency yesterday morning. One town in the county, Long Eddy, had 5.34 inches of rain by 8:20 a.m., Mr. Cornish said. Daniel Hogue, the Sullivan County sheriff, said he had closed all roads in the county except to emergency vehicles. ''We don't want any joy riders out there,'' he said. Sheriff Hogue said that the authorities had evacuated hundreds of people from flooded areas in the towns of Highland, Callicoon and Lumberland. Some evacuations also took place in the townships of Roscoe and Livingston Manor, Sheriff Hogue said. County officials were concerned that the Delaware River might overflow its banks. Sheriff Hogue said it was likely that, by this morning, the river could rise as much as 10 feet over flood stage. In New Jersey, Gov. James E. McGreevy declared a state of emergency in Warren, Hunterdon, Sussex and Mercer Counties, The Associated Press reported. Officials in Warren Country were trying to evacuate about 2,000 residents in several communities along the Delaware River. Joe Orlando, a spokesman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, said two highway ramps in or near Newark -- 14A and 15E -- were temporarily shut down by flooding. In Connecticut, where nearly three inches of rain fell in parts of the state, a boater died after his 31-foot trimarin capsized in Long Island Sound near Niantic Bay in six-foot seas and winds of 50 knots, The A.P. reported. In Manhattan, at the West Fourth Street subway station, Kate Greenthal and Leah Brunski, both 23, were desperately trying to get to the Bronx for the big game between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. They had started out on the 4 train on the East Side, but when they found that it was shut down they walked west to take the B or D lines. ''When we got here, it was no dice again,'' Ms. Greenthal said. In the Bronx, the rain caused a brick retaining wall about 30 feet high by 100 feet long to collapse, sending tons of soil and asphalt slamming into the rear of two attached six-story apartment buildings at 2770 and 2780 Kingsbridge Terrace, according to a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, Jennifer Givner. No one was injured at the buildings, though all of the apartments were evacuated, she said."
