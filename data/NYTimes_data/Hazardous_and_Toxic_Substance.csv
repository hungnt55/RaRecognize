"The air in the New York region is not what it used to be, and for the most part that's a good thing. Over the 30 years since the passage of the federal Clean Air Act, pollutants like lead, carbon monoxide and especially the gritty black soot that was long one of the region's most hallowed, if hated, symbols, have all sharply declined. The number of days each summer with the most severe ozone smog is typically no more than a third of what it was in the early 1980's. At the same time, it became a lot easier to shift the blame elsewhere for the problems that did remain. The industrial Midwest, with its coal-burning factories and power plants, all wafting their toxic fumes east on the prevailing upper air currents, became a handy shorthand for the idea that poor little New York was the victim of someone else's excess. But many scientists and air quality experts say that more and more, the old patterns and assumptions and lines of responsibility about air quality no longer tell the whole story. Some believe that the best years of improvement may be over. Most agree that at the very least, the picture will grow increasingly complicated, as issues ranging from power plant construction to climate change to new ways and ideas for measuring pollution all unfold in the years and decades to come. The air that local residents are breathing this spring, the experts say, is already being considered as a kind of case study for the new air-quality equation. For example, in early May -- much earlier in the year than normal -- a sudden surge of hot, humid weather helped create ground-level ozone smog across the region, just as tree pollen was setting records and causing untold headaches for hay fever sufferers. Unrelated events? The new air science says maybe not. The pollen resulted from a cool early spring followed by a blast of premature summer; the trees reacted to the heat wave with a reflexive spasm of procreation. But new research has also shown that pollen production may be linked in a perverse way to climate change because higher levels of carbon dioxide -- a primary greenhouse gas blamed for planetary warming -- encourage trees to produce more pollen. If the meteorological mood swings of April and May were in fact a sign of long-term climate disruption, and not ordinary variability -- still a debatable point among scientists -- then suddenly, nothing about the air looks quite the same. The pollen count itself, once a natural, if annoying, rite of spring, has become tied to human dependence on fossil fuels. As if that were not enough, recent research has also found that pollen can bind itself to diesel exhaust particles, creating a sort of bio-industrial cocktail. Health consequences of the pollen-diesel combination, if any, remain uncertain, scientists say. ''What we're seeing is a confluence of issues,'' said Dr. Paul R. Epstein, the associate director for health and global environment at Harvard Medical School. Worries about air quality were only part of the agenda for President Bush as he took to the road last week to sell his energy plan to the nation. But many environmentalists say that because the president's energy plan is so weighted toward new production of electricity and petroleum, environmental consequences have been drawn into the spotlight as well, creating the opportunity for a broad public debate that did not exist before. Meanwhile, some other, older ideas about the environment and air quality are being blown apart entirely. Much new air pollution research is based on the idea that there is no such thing as a regional air supply as it has been traditionally defined, but rather a series of microclimates, differing neighborhood by neighborhood and street by street. Each individual, some research suggests, carries around a personalized cloud of contaminants depending on his or her environment, lifestyle and consumer-products choices -- dubbed the Pig Pen effect, in honor of the famously unbathed character from the ''Peanuts'' comic strip. The new focus is on what people actually breathe -- walking around, working, exercising, living their lives -- rather than on what is measured on high-rise rooftops, where most sensors in New York City have usually been placed, even though only pigeons live there. Two years ago, for example, scientists from Columbia University and Harvard took 40 student volunteers from A. Philip Randolph High School in Harlem and fitted them with special air-sensor backpacks. The students were asked to wear the six-pound devices, or keep them nearby, even when they were asleep, for 48 hours, wherever they went and whatever they did. The results are still being assessed, said Steven N. Chillrud, an associate research scientist at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who led the fieldwork portion of the study, but the early and unquestioned conclusion is that even from one block to the next, the air is different depending on where you breathe it. ''Central monitoring doesn't pick up the full range of exposures for many compounds, and personal exposures are higher still,'' said Dr. John D. Spengler, a professor of environmental health and human habitation at the Harvard School of Public Health, which is analyzing part of the backpack results. ''It's these interactions that we're just beginning to appreciate.'' Other investigators are challenging assumptions about where pollution in New York comes from. The conventional explanation of lead in the atmosphere, for example, held that it came mainly from leaded gasoline. In studies around the country, the historical curve was strikingly similar. Leaded gas reached its peak use in the late 1960's and early 1970's, and lead in the air began declining after that period as cars switched over to unleaded gas. But a recent research project that used core samples of mud taken from the Lake in Central Park showed a different pattern altogether. The study, conducted by researchers from Columbia, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, concluded that garbage incineration in the city had been a major contributor to the lead problem. The core samples showed high lead levels in New York's air dating all the way back to the 1930's. When the city halted new incinerator construction in 1964, and later federal air pollution laws pushed most existing incinerators to close, the city's lead levels began to decline. In other words, forget the upper air patterns from Ohio or the traffic jams on the New Jersey Turnpike -- the city had at least partly made its own mess. The concept of local neighborhood pollution is also emerging as a major political battlefield as residents around the region begin asking questions, and filing lawsuits, challenging plans for new power plants in their communities. And researchers are scratching their heads over many of the same questions as the residents. How do pollutants from many different sources, especially those clustered in a single community, interact in the air and in the human body? If there are three or four factories or power plants in a neighborhood, is it possible that each one individually may be in perfect compliance on air emissions, but that collectively, they are not? How do you measure the urban world's total impact on one person? And how, especially, do you write policy rules to protect the public health when these questions begin to be answered? ''A place-based approach to air quality regulation, that's the next horizon,'' said Jason Grumet, the executive director of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an interstate association of the air quality control divisions of the six New England states and New York and New Jersey. Ultimately, many scientists and public health experts say, the real risk to the New York region is that it will essentially outgrow its existing air quality system. Ray Werner, the chief of the local air programs branch at the federal Environmental Protection Agency, calls this problem ''lines of tension.'' Like a giant ratchet, tighter air quality rules are grinding up against the reality of a region that has boomed economically and grown in population. The impact of cleaner gasoline, Mr. Werner said, has been offset by more vehicles on the roads, including more sport utility vehicles and light trucks, which pollute the air more than ordinary cars. Cleaner technologies for making electricity using natural gas are countered by the need to build more power plants. The concept of the tension lines repeats itself again and again. Conservation groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council have contended that if new, cleaner electrical power plants replace older oil-burning ones, they could mean cleaner air for the region. But state officials and administrators of the state power grid, who are responsible for keeping the lights on, have taken steps to allow small private diesel generators -- dirtier electricity sources than anything now operating in the region -- to be switched on at moments of electricity shortage beginning this summer. ''Right now we're the marble in the middle of the seesaw,'' said Peter Lehner, the chief of the environmental protection bureau at the New York State attorney general's office. ''Our air quality could go one way or it could go the other. The answer depends on how we respond.''"
"On a gentle, lumpy hill that runs down to the Hudson River, a landscaper scatters wildflower seeds. Just a few yards away, residents stroll along a pier where new riverfront condominiums sell for $700,000. To the south, the sky rings with the crash of piles being driven into open land, ahead of the hotels, the shops, and apartments now on the drawing board. This is the Promenade in Edgewater, and behind the tidy scene, with its wide-angle views of the Hudson and the towers of Manhattan, is one of the most contaminated stretches of land in the northeastern United States. Here, a developer says he will rescue lost and ruined land by building a tiny, upscale village on a giant concrete platform, 10 feet above tainted ground. The builder, Gene Heller, says he is taking advantage of a new spirit in New Jersey and more flexible approaches championed by Christie Whitman, the state's former governor and now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. ''At the end of the day, the property will be far cleaner than it ever was,'' Mr. Heller said. Yet state and federal regulators say they are being outrun by Mr. Heller, despite a harrowing spectrum of pollution on his land. Just below the skin of that newly-seeded hill, for instance, is a slumping gypsum landfill that officials say is producing a toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide. The condominiums on the pier were placed there against the wishes of state officials, who pleaded with the developer to wait for a clean-up of deadly contaminants that are leeching into the river sediment around the wharf. And beyond the pile-driving machinery is a wide swath of ground laced with heavy metals and most prominently arsenic, a lethal poison that is deemed unsafe above 20 parts per million in soil. Portions of the ground at the site, tests show, are 7 percent arsenic -- or 7 parts per hundred, 70,000 parts per million. Now Mr. Heller is proceeding on his $100 million complex without final environmental clearance and with no plans in place to stop the plume of arsenic and coal tar that runs through two pieces of property, including his, and down to the Hudson. The runoff is settling in the sediment and killing marine life as far as 750 feet into the river, a study done for the E.P.A. found. Twice this year, regulators have pressured Mr. Heller to shut down the project, most recently because construction workers were digging in raw, contaminated soil with virtually no protection. Many of the workers said they became ill. This week, the pile-driving operation was suspended by Mr. Heller's contractor when monitors showed that high levels of carbon monoxide were being released from the ground. In January, federal officials moved to list the property adjacent to Mr. Heller's on the national Superfund list for environmental clean-ups. A portion of Mr. Heller's property, they say, also qualifies for the list. Mr. Heller says the regulators have been dithering about the pollution for years, and that he is actually doing something constructive. ''We're fixing it,'' he says. ''Isn't that good?'' If the difficulties at the Promenade do not provide a simple yes or no answer to Mr. Heller's question, that is because the site is a vivid example of the high-stakes arm-wrestling that goes on between real estate developers and environmental regulators when a piece of drastically polluted land is simultaneously developed and cleaned. The pollution there -- and indeed, along much of the Hudson River south of the George Washington Bridge -- is the residue of a century of heavy industry. After the last chemical business shut down in 1981, the site was unused for 20 years. When residential real estate prices soared during the 1990's, the empty land, within a half mile by water of Manhattan, became known as the Gold Coast. Three years ago, Mrs. Whitman, then governor, came to this tiny borough and signed a bill making it simpler and less risky for developers to reclaim land just like Mr. Heller's. Regulators say such places can be made safe for people to live on, but only with great care. ''Our concern is that the development has been proceeding at a much faster pace than we can keep up with,'' said Richard Ho, an official with the E.P.A. Robert Hayton, who is overseeing the site for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said: 'The developers have a schedule, and they need to keep that schedule. That's the way it has been for the last three years. They just don't have a clue when it comes to the environment. They ignore it.'' Far from ignoring the problems, says Mr. Heller, he has spent a sum he estimates variously at $3 million, $4 million and $5 million to clean them up. Mr. Hayton says the state has received documentation from Mr. Heller of slightly less than $1 million in remediation costs. To make the land habitable, Mr. Heller plans to bury the existing soil beneath an 18-inch ''cap'' of sand and brick. On top of that will be a garage. And one story above the garage will be a 10-acre concrete platform, where he will do landscaping, build streets, and then add homes, stores, and two hotels. ''We will have this massive new earth -- up in the air, an average of 10 feet high,'' said Mr. Heller. He expects to be finished late next year. Mr. Hayton said that Mr. Heller's development approach ''will be protective of human health,'' meeting the state's legal standard for residential construction. Nevertheless, state officials have not given final approval for the project because of concerns about the uncontrolled release of gases from the ground, which could be dangerous to people, and because of contaminants in the ground, which are damaging the environment. Federal officials say the adjacent Superfund site, which is fenced off, poses no ''immediate public health threats.'' Because a day care center is next door, they are conducting air sampling and soil tests. The developer has generally complied with state requests, according to Mr. Hayton. For example, he said, when the first apartments on the site were offered for sale, the prospectus did not disclose the nearby pollution problems. But after the D.E.P. contacted Mr. Heller's lawyers, the information was added. The state will require disclosure of the pollution problems to all prospective buyers. Of the remaining contamination, Mr. Hayton said, perhaps the most pressing is the arsenic and coal tar. Mr. Heller agreed that he had some work to do, but pointedly avoided using the word arsenic. He said, ''We have one more item to complete -- the taking out of some minerals in one area that are beyond the standards of D.E.P.'' Initially, Mr. Heller denied knowing specifically which ''minerals'' are in the ground. Later, he acknowledged that he was referring to the arsenic on the southern portion of his land, and agreed that it had been the subject of a running dispute with the state environmental agency. The contamination is on the land abutting the Superfund site. The soil and groundwater concentrations of arsenic and coal tar are so high that at least the southern portion of Mr. Heller's property would be eligible for listing as a national Superfund site if the state requested it, according to John B. Prince, a chief in the E.P.A.'s Superfund section. State officials say they have not proposed the Heller property for the Superfund list, in part because they believe they have enough legal leverage to press Mr. Heller to clean it. Until last week, Mr. Heller refused to remove the arsenic, which contaminates as much as 10,000 cubic yards of soil, according to Mr. Hayton of the New Jersey D.E.P. The developer said he would pave over the area and shift his buildings away, but state officials insisted that the contaminated soil be hauled to a hazardous waste facility. ''We capitulated,'' Mr. Heller said. The most serious immediate consequence of the arsenic and coal tar, say officials, is that they continue to seep into the river and have settled deep into sediments as far as 750 feet east of the shoreline and at least 400 feet north and south. The property is roughly halfway between the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel, and directly across the Hudson from 98th Street on the West Side of Manhattan. Last year, river sediment from the area was tested by the E.P.A. to see if the contaminants were harming marine life. Minnows and tiny clams were placed in tanks with sediment samples and clean salt water. The researchers found that the pollution -- which included not only the arsenic, but also high levels of chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, zinc, coal tar, and numerous organic compounds -- was having a significant impact on the marine communities in the entire area, with the possibility that the contamination would ''biomagnify,'' or move into the human food chain. In the most deadly sediment, all the creatures were dead within 14 days. That sample was collected from the riverbank directly in front of Mr. Heller's property. Even before those tests, concerns about the sediment in the tidal mud flats led state officials in 1999 to ask that Mr. Heller and his company, Edgewater Enterprises L.L.C., hold off the first phase of his development, a group of prefabricated apartments installed on a pier. ''The department does strongly believe that it would be in the best interest of the public and Edgewater Enterprises that construction be delayed'' while more tests were done, wrote Susan Boyle, an assistant commissioner with the D.E.P. Despite the concerns, state officials did not have the authority to order Mr. Heller to stop that particular work, Ms. Boyle said in an interview. Mr. Heller said that the federal government had been supervising the adjacent site since 1984, and that he doubted that either the state or the federal environmental agencies would ever do anything about the sediments. There was, he said, no reason for him to wait. ''We said, absolutely not. It's our property,'' he said. ''I'm not concerned, because I don't think they're ever going to do'' any clean-up. Officials at both agencies said that after the public had a chance to comment on proposals for cleaning the Superfund site, the agency would decide on how to attack the contamination. ''Fine,'' Mr. Heller said. ''They can take care of it. Whatever they decide.'' Mr. Heller signed an administrative order of consent in which he agreed to clean his property to state standards, and he acknowledges that he has not yet been issued the final clearances for his construction. Still, he said, he expects no problems, either from the state or from his own financial backers. ''As long as we follow the plans the state people want us to follow, the money people are satisfied,'' Mr. Heller said. ''We did everything that every agency under the world requested us to do.'' Earlier this year, however, state officials say that he began work without notifying them, as required under his agreement. The state ordered him to stop, so regulators could be sure that the piles were not driving surface contamination deeper into the groundwater. ''We found that it would not make a difference, since the water was contaminated from the surface all the way to the bedrock,'' said Mr. Hayton of the D.E.P. Mr. Heller denies starting work without permission, and insisted that Mr. Hayton simply had not been paying attention. While the work was shut down, a number of elected officials made calls to the state agency, pressing Mr. Heller's case, according to Ms. Boyle. She would not identify them. ''I can assure you that nothing about this remediation has been changed because of any telephone call,'' she said, adding, ''It has been a very difficult site.'' When work resumed after the first shut down, construction workers said they were suffering frequent nosebleeds, headaches, and rasping throats. They were not provided with protective gear for handling hazardous materials, or decontamination areas, according to Michael Carroll, a lawyer with the firm of O'Dwyer & Bernstien, who is representing the dockworkers. ''I passed a crane through a puddle and the water splashed on my leg,'' said Lou Carletti, a foreman with Local 1456 of the Dockbuilders of New York and New Jersey. He said that his skin became puffy and red. None of the gas monitors that were supposed to signal the presence of dangerous fumes were in working order, said John Graham, a health and safety officer with the New York District Council of Carpenters, which is the umbrella organization for the dock builders union. As of this week, said Mr. Graham, the dock builders will not be breathing any fumes from the site. Instead, they will be wearing masks and drawing fresh air from tanks. On a morning in April, a dock builder, Karl Dahl, cut a beam with an acetylene torch. A stroke of the blue flame swept the bare ground. ''The dirt caught fire,'' Mr. Dahl recalled. At the request of the union, inspectors from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration visited the site in May and asked Mr. Heller to close it. All construction stopped for six weeks, and before it resumed, the workers were sent to a 40-hour training program on handling hazardous materials. The soil was covered with plastic tarps and gravel. The dockworkers on the original crew were not impressed. They did not return. ''I will never go back there,'' said Mr. Dahl. A spokesman for OSHA said an active investigation was under way. Mr. Heller was particularly angered that the workers had called in OSHA, and said that his project was a great step forward for the Hudson River waterfront, the county and the state. ''We did not do anything wrong,'' he said ''A lot of good things are happening on the Gold Coast of New Jersey.''"
"The Bush administration is facing a critical public health and environmental choice about the future of the Hudson River. It must decide whether to embrace the proposal made by the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2000 -- after 11 years of study -- to get polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, out of the river by dredging and removing contaminated sediments from the upper Hudson. From the 1940's through the 1970's, General Electric discharged more than one million pounds of PCB's into the Hudson from two now-abandoned plants. PCB's have been banned in this country since 1979; the E.P.A. classifies them as carcinogens in animals and potentially in people. They persist in the environment and accumulate in the food chain, so that eating fish caught in the Hudson may cause harm. As a result, 200 miles of the Hudson River have been declared a federal Superfund hazardous waste site. Fish consumption bans are in place in a 40-mile stretch of the upper Hudson from Hudson Falls to Troy. The E.P.A. has found that a cleanup would greatly reduce the health risks of consuming upper Hudson River fish. Under the Superfund law, G.E. could bear the financial responsibility for this cleanup, which may cost nearly $500 million. The E.P.A.'s decision-making has reflected both the magnitude of the public health and environmental issues and the potential expense. Before proposing limited dredging of toxic hot spots, the agency undertook years of study, publishing several detailed reports assessing the behavior of pollutants in the river and their effects on people and wildlife. There were five independent peer reviews of the research. The E.P.A.'s scientists found that PCB's in the river would not change chemical composition and become benign, nor would they be covered up by river sediments. The sediments are constantly shifting and exposing new areas of contaminated river bottom, and capping toxic hot spots is not feasible given the river's turbulence. Although fish tissue contamination has declined since PCB's were banned in the late 1970's, and as a result of G.E.'s efforts to limit PCB leakage from its former factories, the government's data show that contamination in the fish cannot reach safe levels for generations without removal of PCB's from the river bottom. Although G.E. argues that dredging will do harm, modern dredging technologies can capture pollutants from contaminated sediments and avoid disrupting the ecology of the river. The opponents of dredging also say questions about dredging's effects have not been thoroughly answered. But the environmental laws do not require absolute certainty before action to address a clear problem. The Hudson cleanup is not one that will happen overnight; it will require time and perhaps even revision along the way. Gov. George Pataki's office has supported the plan proposed by the Clinton administration. So much time has been devoted to studying this issue that the Bush administration should move ahead with a responsible cleanup. America's modern environmental movement has demonstrated over the last 30 years that public health and environmental protections can be achieved without weakening the economy. This was true in the cleanup of polluted waterfronts across the country, from Baltimore's Inner Harbor to Chicago's lakefront. The same will be true of the Hudson. The cleaner the Hudson, the greater the possibility that tourism, recreation and appropriate real estate development along its reaches will thrive. Op-Ed Contributor Gary S. Guzy served as general counsel of the Environmental Protection Agency under Bill Clinton."
"WHAT do your car's high-intensity headlamps, antilock brake system, navigation screen and trunk- or hood-mounted light switches have in common? All may contain mercury, a highly toxic element. The Clean Car Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups, is trying to persuade automakers not just to stop using mercury, but to take responsibility for what is in millions of vehicles on the road. The industry has agreed to phase out most mercury switches by the end of the 2001 model year, but is balking at the monumental effort required to remove existing switches. Charles Griffith, auto project director at the Ecology Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the groups in the coalition, said it was not necessarily calling on automakers to recall cars with the switches, but wanted them to agree to remove the devices voluntarily when the vehicles are brought in for service or are recalled for other reasons. Mercury accumulates in water and in the tissues of humans, fish and animals, and was declared a hazardous air pollutant by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1971. Mercury is slowly being phased out of many uses, including thermometers, but it is still used in many industrial processes and is present in fluorescent lights, thermostats, appliances and toys like maze puzzles. Michael Bender, executive director of the Mercury Policy Project, a group in Montpelier, Vt., that seeks the elimination of mercury, said the auto industry installed 10 tons of the element in car switches in 1995. That amount has been sharply reduced, though precise figures are not available. Most European and Japanese automakers stopped installing mercury convenience-light switches in the mid-1990's; those switches are now used in only a few Ford and General Motors vehicles. But even as the switches are being phased out, domestic and foreign companies are equipping cars with headlamps, brake components and navigation systems that contain mercury. The auto industry is not the leading source of mercury, Mr. Bender said, ''but it's definitely a significant source.'' He points to coal-fired power plants and waste incinerators as the prime sources of airborne mercury in the United States. Mr. Griffith says the mercury in auto switches is released into the atmosphere when steel recovered from scrapped automobiles is melted down in arc furnaces. Dr. Robert J. Kainz, a senior manager for pollution prevention at DaimlerChrysler, said that only two of the company's products, the Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler, still had mercury antilock-brake switches. ''There are better ways of handling this problem than going after the carmakers,'' Dr. Kainz said. ''Eighty-seven percent of the mercury going out into the atmosphere is coming from utility boilers, waste combustors, coal-fired power plants, cement plants and medical incinerators.'' Mr. Kainz also said DaimlerChrysler's records did not consistently identify which cars or trucks actually had mercury switches, making any systematic recall and removal difficult. Five states have laws that either put restrictions on the use, sale or disposal of mercury, or that require product labels. Similar bills are pending in 15 state legislatures. In New York, the Comprehensive Management of Waste Mercury Act, which has 40 co-sponsors and is before the Assembly's Rules Committee, puts the onus on manufacturers to remove mercury switches. Bills pending in California and Oregon would require auto dismantlers to remove mercury switches before cars could be crushed. The auto industry has lobbied against producer-responsibility laws, arguing that it is phasing out mercury on its own. Gregory Dana, vice president for environmental affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler began removing mercury from products in 1995, under an agreement with Michigan. Switches in existing cars should be removed when the car is scrapped, he said, adding: ''The recyclers are already taking out the gasoline, oil and air-conditioner refrigerant. It's a simple add-on for them to rip out the mercury switches.'' But the Automotive Recyclers Association and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries say they have little financial incentive to take on the task, since each switch includes only a gram of mercury, and the element is trading for less than $2 a pound. William P. Steinkuller, executive vice president of the auto recycling group, said: ''The auto manufacturers engineered the vehicles to include mercury switches, produced the product and profited from it. It defies logic that they now want to deny any responsibility and put the onus on dismantlers.''"
"There were bananas whose curvature could not be excessive, and rhubarb whose stalks must be straight, and they all belonged in the category of myths about the intrusiveness of European Union directives to its member states. But there is one order about to be imposed that sounds just as improbable -- bizarre, even -- and yet, it seems, is true: under a rule to curb hazardous substances in electrical products, Europe is about to restrict the centuries-old business of building pipe organs for churches, concert halls and other institutions. The reason? Organ pipes contain large amounts of lead, and the wind that blows through them is generated by electricity (rather than the older method of people pumping bellows behind the organ). The new directive, to come into force in July, limits the proportion of hazardous substances like lead, mercury or cadmium to 0.1 percent of a finished product that works on electricity. ''We are caught in an absurd anomaly,'' said Doug Levey, a spokesman for the Institute of British Organ Building, which says it represents most of the country's 400 organ builders in about 65 companies. The directive, approved by European governments four years ago, was intended to address problems caused by the disposal of products like cellphones or computer circuit boards. Dumped in landfills, the argument goes, discarded items of consumer electronics pollute groundwater as hazardous substances are leached from them. But no one, it seems, had thought of the organ builders, whose products make unlikely candidates for landfills. Disused organ pipes, some of them containing 50 percent lead or lead-tin alloy, are usually melted down for reuse, Mr. Levey said. New pipe organs, he said, can cost from $85,000 to $850,000 and upward. A manually powered organ, Mr. Levey pointed out, would not be covered by the directive, no matter how much lead was used. However, he said, ''if in the name of progress you use an electronic fan to provide the wind, the same organ with the same amount of lead falls within the restrictions.'' The organ builders have accused the British authorities of dragging their heels in their response to the directive. The Department of Trade and Industry, the government office responsible for the issue, insists it is the organ builders themselves who ''must apply for an exemption directly'' to the European Union, said a spokeswoman for the department, who insisted on anonymity in accordance with government rules for departmental spokespeople. The European Commission issued a statement saying, ''British organ builders need not fear for the future of their art and craft.'' ''The European Commission has no wish to jeopardize this ancient tradition,'' the statement said. ''Our only aim is to ensure that the intended health and safety aims of forthcoming legislation are achieved as decided by European governments and the European Parliament.'' ''Existing church organs are not affected,'' the statement continued, referring to what Mr. Levey estimated were more than 20,000 pipe organs in churches and concert halls across Britain. ''Organists can continue to play pipe organs, people can enjoy their beautiful music, and the industry can even continue to repair them with lead without any restrictions.'' The statement noted that organ makers could apply for an exemption but that so far none had. Barbara Helfferich, the environment spokeswoman for the European Commission in Brussels, said in a telephone interview that only British organ builders, who produce around 40 pipe organs a year, had complained, and even they had not applied for an exemption. The directive, she said, was intended to curb the use of hazardous substances to protect workers in manufacturing plants and the environment, including at disposal sites. Exemptions, she said, were intended to give makers time to find alternative substances. Organ builders argue that lead is essential to create the instrument's distinctive sound. ''People used to think we couldn't live without asbestos to make ships float and to build buildings,'' she said. ''Then we discovered that's highly toxic. So it's banned, and we still have buildings and we still have ships.'' Bernard Dargassies, head of the French organ builder Manufacture Vosgiennes des Grandes Orgues, said it seemed as if ''all of a sudden we have discovered that lead is dangerous, like the atomic bomb.'' ''It's ridiculous,'' he said of the directive. ''They can't prevent us from making organ pipes. This law will decimate organ builders.'' In a telephone interview, he indicated that he had not sought an exemption, but would if necessary. ''If we have to act in this way, we will,'' he said. ''We are living in a world where we can't do anything. It is dictatorship.''"
"HOW would you like to have lawfully sold your Tyco stock months before the corporate scandal hit the front pages? That's precisely what the Calvert Group did when a disturbing trend in Tyco's annual toxic emission disclosures led to questions about how well Tyco was managing the rest of its operations. Now, President Bush and the Environmental Protection Agency want to weaken the largely successful Toxics Release Inventory program, which requires companies to tell the public how they dispose of or release nearly 650 chemicals that may harm human health and the environment. The disclosure program makes data available for anyone -- journalists, policymakers, investors or parents -- to learn exactly which chemicals are being released from corporate smokestacks and discharge pipes. Congress developed this critical program in 1986, in response to the catastrophic deaths of thousands of people after a spill of toxic chemicals at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India. It has worked well since its inception, but the Environmental Protection Agency is now proposing three detrimental changes that could go into effect within the next year. The first would relax the current annual reporting requirement and let companies make reports every other year instead; the second would allow polluters to release 10 times more toxic chemicals -- up to 5,000 pounds annually -- without disclosing the volume released or where the pollutants went; and the third would permit companies to conceal releases of up to 500 pounds annually of particularly dangerous toxic materials, like PCB's, lead and mercury, which can accumulate in people's bodies. All three changes effectively increase the amount of pollution that companies can emit without telling anyone. Investors should be particularly concerned about the effects of the agency's proposal. Sound investment requires sound information. We have long honored the disinfectant power of sunshine in our securities laws, dating back to the reforms after the stock market crash of 1929, as well as the reforms that followed the more recent governance scandals. The Toxics Release Inventory provides an additional mechanism by which investors can tell the difference between well and poorly managed companies before the consequences show up in portfolios. A bipartisan group of 12 state attorneys general have joined in opposition to the agency's proposal, arguing that it would impede governments, first responders and citizens from protecting people from the harm caused by toxic chemicals. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, first responders used Toxics Release Inventory data to identify factories and industrial sites where toxic chemical releases would have been possible. A Texas community used such data to inform the public when companies were polluting the rich shrimp and oyster breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico. Many companies intend to continue annual reporting, regardless of the E.P.A.'s proposed rule change. For example, Edwin L. Mongan III, DuPont's director of energy and environment, says that his company will probably continue to collect and release information about toxic materials annually, noting, ''It's just a good business practice to track your hazardous materials.'' According to Mr. Mongan, DuPont uses this information internally and is ''committed to being transparent about its environmental performance.'' The E.P.A.'s weakening of the Toxics Release Inventory program does not require Congressional approval, only notification. This is just one more example of the Bush Administration's efforts to quietly undermine our nation's environmental protections. Washington should be working to expand corporate disclosure and accountability, rather than moving to allow polluters to conceal their toxic releases.

"For more than 40 years, Hexagon Laboratories made pharmaceuticals on a quiet stretch of Peartree Avenue not far from Co-op City in the Bronx. When the company abandoned the site in 1989, it left behind thousands of gallons of toxic waste. After years of community agitation and the discovery that the lot was littered with carcinogens, explosives and poisons like cyanide, the state attorney general's office announced last week that it had reached a settlement with companies involved in Hexagon's business or its chemical operations at the site: they will pay about two-thirds of the $9 million cleanup cost. ''Even urban toxic waste sites are usually less contaminated than this site, where numerous hazardous chemicals were spilled during chemical manufacturing processes,'' said Eugene J. Leff, an assistant attorney general with the Environmental Protection Bureau. Unknown to its neighbors, Mr. Leff said, Hexagon failed to properly dispose of more than 600 drums and 27 tanks of potentially lethal chemicals after it declared bankruptcy in 1989. Some of the underground tanks deteriorated, allowing poisons to leach into the groundwater. The authorities investigated the lot, in Eastchester, only after people in homes and businesses near the former pharmaceutical plant complained for months about acrid odors and dead birds, and about the chemicals that came up when they flushed their toilets. The state eventually certified that the site was a significant health risk requiring emergency cleanup. ''We said, 'We have a problem here,' but no one did anything,'' said the Rev. Richard F. Gorman, chairman of Community Board 12, who is among the residents who have pressed for more than two decades to get the site cleaned. ''I doubt very much this would have been allowed to go on in Manhattan, but you are dealing with a community of color in an outer borough.'' During the past 16 years, the New York City Police Department's bomb squad and state and federal toxic waste specialists have removed an array of perilous materials, including cyanide, benzene, compressed gas cylinders, explosives, mercury, asbestos and PCB's. But concerns remain about the extent of the contamination and its potential to cause cancer in the neighborhood, which has streets with rows of auto body shops and other blocks with $400,000 houses. For years, a dairy operated across the street from the toxic lot. ''You will not know the true impact of that soil contamination for years to come,'' said Carmen Rosa, who lives near the site and is district manager of Community Board 12. Also unclear is the extent to which chemicals have polluted an underground stream that feeds the Hutchinson River, which is about 1,000 feet from the Peartree Avenue lot. Officials said the contaminants have not reached the river. When Attorney General Eliot Spitzer brought a lawsuit in 2001 against Boehringer Ingelheim, the German chemical corporation that used to own Hexagon Laboratories, he said, ''The owners of this site showed no regard for those living nearby and have taken no responsibility for the problems they have created.'' The $6.2 million settlement involves 31 chemical companies, but not Hexagon's last owner, Louis P. Wiener, who was not a party to the agreement because Hexagon left no assets. Mr. Wiener and his lawyer, Richard F. Ricci, declined to comment. Mr. Leff said the chemical companies were reluctant to pay anything, even though they were legally liable for the chemicals they had shipped to Hexagon to be processed. ''The companies were determined to fight tooth and nail,'' he said. The companies did not admit any liability in settling with the state. The remaining cost of the $9 million cleanup bill will be paid from the state Superfund program. The state plans to treat the groundwater by injecting a combination of hydrogen peroxide and iron salts into the lot's bedrock, a process that will turn the contaminants into less harmful compounds. Concerns about chemical leaks at the lot have existed for decades. Hexagon was fined repeatedly for chemical spills and was ordered to install water-monitoring wells, although it is not clear if the company ever did so. The cleanup at the site, which was eventually taken over by the city, did not begin until the early 1990's, first by the Police Department in 1990 and then by the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1992. The State Department of Environmental Conservation placed the lot on the state Superfund site list as a threat to public health in 1993, but did not start its own cleanup until 1997. During the E.P.A. cleanup, three workers were hospitalized after being overcome by fumes. The last of the contaminated soil was removed last December. The presence of toxic materials did not deter a group of homeless people and drug users from finding shelter in the abandoned buildings on the Hexagon site. To keep warm, they often lighted fires, causing neighbors to fear that whatever chemicals remained would ignite and send a toxic cloud to Co-op City. The Fire Department developed an evacuation plan for Co-op City in the event of a chemical fire on the lot. Even though the settlement and the removal of chemicals from the groundwater will close a chapter on the Hexagon site, neighbors say they deserve more from the chemical companies involved. ''I think they owe this community an apology,'' Ms. Rosa said. ''But for the grace of God, we've been fortunate no one has died or been injured.''"
"LAST week, Maine became the first state to require manufacturers of computer monitors and televisions to pay for their recycling and disposal. Washington, with a pending bill, may be next. That's progress, right? Computer recycling sounds like an unmitigated good: it keeps hazardous components out of incinerators and landfills, which researchers at Carnegie Mellon University estimate already hold more than 60 million computers. And by reusing glass, plastic, aluminum and heavy metals (like lead, copper and mercury), recycling averts the energy use and pollution linked with mining and drilling for new materials. But because recycling in the United States is expensive, hazardous and encumbered with environmental and safety regulations, many companies that collect e-waste simply ship it to underdeveloped nations. According to the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and the Basel Action Network, up to 80 percent of the material dropped off by well-meaning Americans at community recycling events ends up bundled for export. Most of the stuff that goes overseas can't or won't be fixed and sold. Computer dealers in Lagos, Nigeria, for example, complain that up to 75 percent of the 400,000 units they receive each month from recyclers are junk. A 2002 documentary showed Chinese workers, including children, using hammers and chisels to pry copper and aluminum from computers, burning PVC-coated wires to get at copper and swirling acids in buckets to extract gold. After stripping what they can, workers dump the computer carcasses and waste sludge in nearby fields or streams. Soil and water tests in the e-waste processing town of Guiyu, China, for instance, revealed levels of chromium, tin and barium hundreds of times higher than allowable in the United States. It's easy to find American companies that call themselves computer recyclers, but it's hard to trace what they actually do. The government doesn't regulate these businesses, and the Environmental Protection Agency has no certification process for recyclers. There are dozens of e-waste bills being considered across the country, including one in New York City. Five states and 15 counties ban computer and television monitors from landfills. California, Maine, Maryland and Massachusetts have e-waste recycling programs in place, all financed by different mechanisms. Even the electronics industry doesn't like this patchwork approach, but so far, no one has come up with anything better. Four e-waste bills are floating around the House and Senate: the biggest difference between them is whether consumers or manufacturers would pay for the programs. A strong argument holds that when producers must manage their own discards, they have a strong incentive to design equipment that's nontoxic and easy to recycle. The sooner Congress gets it together, the better. Electronic waste is now considered the fastest-growing segment of the municipal waste stream in the United States. The National Safety Council estimated in 2004 that by 2009, 250 million computers will have become obsolete. As awareness of the hazards of e-waste rises, more states will ban it from landfills. But keeping toxic trash from our dumps won't mean a thing if we don't forbid the export of hazardous material to countries without enforceable environmental regulations. To halt this environmental injustice, in which we're all complicit, the federal government needs to restrict the use of hazardous materials in computers, require manufacturers to put in place recycling programs (it will be a lot cheaper and safer to recycle this stuff once the toxics are out) and ban hazardous waste exports. That may sound like a tall order, but that's no reason not to proceed: the European Union has already passed every one of these laws. Op-Ed Contributor Elizabeth Royte is the author, most recently, of ''Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash.''"
"At least 225 industrial plants in this country have switched to using less dangerous chemicals since the 2001 terrorist attacks, lowering the risk that people nearby would be injured or killed by toxic plumes, a new study has found. While these plants represent only a tiny fraction of the estimated 14,000 nationwide that store or use large quantities of extremely hazardous substances, environmentalists nonetheless cite their efforts as proof that companies and utilities can and should make the switch ''It demonstrates what is possible with a concerted national effort,'' said Paul Orum, the author of the report, ''Preventing Toxic Terrorism,'' which is being published Tuesday by the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy group. The plants have often undertaken the changes with little public attention, as happened at Blue Water Pool Chemical. The company, near the airport in Scottsdale, Ariz., no longer uses chlorine gas, which is extremely hazardous, reducing the risk to an estimated 8,300 people. ''I just always had in the back of my mind, what would happen if you had a leak?'' said Buddy Andrews, owner of the company. ''I just did not want to live with it.'' Congress is debating legislation that may accelerate this process, although there is disagreement over how much pressure should be imposed on plant owners. A bill introduced by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, would give plant owners the option of replacing chemicals as a way to improve security, while a separate bill introduced by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, would require certain plants to use safer technology if it was considered practical. The biggest safety improvements have occurred at sewage and water treatment plants. Nationwide, 207 of them have switched to less hazardous processes, most often by replacing chlorine gas with liquid chlorine bleach or ultraviolet light as the primary treatment process. Chlorine gas is much more dangerous because if a storage tank, often a rail car, is pierced or blown up, the gas could form a cloud that could kill thousands of people. One of the plants that stopped using it, Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant in the District of Columbia, included 1.7 million people in its hazard zone. An additional 29 manufacturing or electrical power plants also switched chemicals, including Cargill Inc. factories in Memphis and in Eddyville, Iowa, which had used anhydrous sulfur dioxide to soften corn for corn syrup and animal feed. The chemical, which is extremely hazardous, has been replaced by sodium bisulfite, which is a solid and therefore considered much less of a threat. The study was conducted by contacting 1,800 chemical plants, factories, water utilities and other facilities that had dropped off an Environmental Protection Agency list of industrial facilities that handle significant quantities of extremely hazardous substances. A total of 284 plants either replied to a questionnaire or a follow-up interview about why they were no longer on the list; of those, 225 had made the switch after the terrorist attacks. Of the plants, 217 said concern over an accidental chemical release had motivated the switch. One hundred and seventeen cited concern over terrorism or a desire to improve security. The cost of changing varied widely, from less than $100,000 to more than $20 million. Several plant managers said in interviews on Monday that the new approaches had also resulted in higher operating costs. The total population put at risk by all 284 plants, according to E.P.A. data, was about 38 million, the report said. That number overstates the extent of the actual risk, because it assumes that a major accident would discharge the toxic chemical in a circle around the plant, when in reality chemical leaks generally form much narrower plumes driven by wind and other factors, said Richard A. Falkenrath, a former deputy homeland security adviser at the White House."
"Handsome new town houses selling for more than $2 million hug the waterfront here, and more are on the way. On a curve in the river that offers spectacular views of Manhattan and New York Harbor, earthmovers are at work on a public park. But in the view of some environmentalists, the development on this immensely valuable sliver of shoreline is an experiment of sorts because of what lies underneath it: dirt spotted with hexavalent chromium, a manufacturing component that has been identified as a cause of lung cancer, liver and kidney damage and mutations to human DNA. Hudson County is the nation's chromium-waste center, with almost 200 sites where it was dumped decades ago. Of all those sites, this slice of Weehawken is the first to be reclaimed for residential development, and the reborn riverfront here -- representing an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars -- depends on the remedy that the state has chosen for sites polluted by chromium. The worst spots of contamination have been removed, and most of the 96-acre property has been covered with synthetic sheeting and at least 18 inches of clean soil, called a cap. The mayor said that in the park, the soil cap would be six to eight feet deep in places. The state and local authorities have approved everything the developer, Roseland Properties, has done, and they say the cleanup has far exceeded their standards. But the state's policies are not settled at the moment. Rather, they are caught up in a politically charged discussion about how the state has handled the rush to turn urban wastelands into sought-after real estate. In 2004, the state Department of Environmental Protection issued a moratorium on final approvals of chromium cleanups, and promised stricter standards and less reliance on capping. The new rules have not yet been issued. In the meantime, the agency allowed the waterfront project to proceed even though various environmental groups and some scientists in the state agency contend that in residential areas, a cap can never be protective enough. ''We want an outside audit and review of the entire hazardous site remediation program, with this fiasco in Weehawken being Exhibit A,'' said Joe Morris, of the Interfaith Community Organization, which won a landmark court decision last year ordering the excavation of waste where a cap failed at a former chromium dump site in Jersey City. A federal appeals court, upholding the order last year, scorched the Department of Environmental Protection, citing ''a substantial breakdown in the agency process that has resulted in 20 years of permanent cleanup inaction.'' The state's environmental commissioner, Lisa P. Jackson, said that Mr. Morris's ''idea that this is Exhibit A is more than puzzling to me.'' Ms. Jackson said that the agency would soon revamp its handling of toxic sites, and that the Weehawken development complied with all current regulations. The disclosure of the Hudson chromium sites in the 1980's generated national attention, fed by gruesome recollections of workers at processing plants whose skin and nasal septums had been eaten away by the poison. To be sure, the one in Weehawken was hardly the worst of the Hudson sites. Some of the fill used decades ago to build up the riverfront was contaminated, but chromium was never processed there. Still, Michael S. Friedman, the environmental consultant who manages the project for Roseland, said: ''Everything we do is under a microscope. This is a high-powered lens.'' Mayor Richard F. Turner said that Weehawken ''has brought in outside experts, outside consultants -- we don't even rely on D.E.P. consultants.'' Michael Campion, the township's environmental consultant, said, ''When I look at the numbers in Weehawken, and it's been tested like crazy, a cap is a reasonable remedy.'' He recommended approving Roseland's plan, but he acknowledged in his review that nearly all caps eventually suffer erosion. Caps are often used on closed landfills, but much less frequently, and only recently on sites where people will live and buildings and traffic will bear down on the soil. The chromium issue caused unusually public recriminations within the environmental agency. After a group convened to reconsider the cleanup standards recommended leaving them unchanged, one member, Zoe Kelman, a chemical engineer, wrote a 50-page dissent. Several other agency scientists, speaking on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution, said that the Department of Environmental Protection had bent to political pressure to speed cleanups. Ms. Kelman accused the agency of disregarding tests at one capped site, in Kearny, that found hexavalent chromium levels thousands of times higher than the agency plan had expected. She also noted that while New Jersey sets the allowable level of hexavalent chromium in soil at 240 parts per million, Maryland's standard is 30 parts per million, and Oregon's is 23. ''I always feel the public believes we err on the side of protection, and it's obvious now that we don't,'' Ms. Kelman said. The agency's critics were supported by a soil scientist at Cornell University, Murray McBride, who submitted an opinion in June 2005 that the current reliance on capping ''seems to me to be a stopgap, short-term approach'' that fails to account for the way chromium moves in the soil and may migrate to basements and other exposed areas. In Weehawken, questions remain about the last known remaining concentration of chromium waste, a one-acre lot near the town houses where some of the more contaminated dirt was dumped, covered with sheeting and then paved for parking. Mr. Morris and Jeff Tittel, the director of the state chapter of the Sierra Club, met with Commissioner Jackson this summer to argue that the mound under the parking lot should be classified as a hazardous waste dump and removed or encapsulated. They said the commissioner resisted, although Ms. Jackson said in an interview that she had never ruled out revisiting the site. Mr. Tittel has a larger quarrel with the state's redevelopment policies, which were loosened in the 1990's -- and which he said ''changed from cleaning up sites to making them land banks for development.'' ''We have finally created social equity in New Jersey,'' Mr. Tittel said, ''because we have people in $3 million condos living on top of toxic sites, not just working and poor people.'' Property values have soared since the last of the 42 town houses was built in 2004. A house that sold less than two years ago for $1.5 million was put up for sale in September for $2.7 million, while several others are on the market for $2.4 million to $4 million. Among the residents is a principal of Roseland, Marshall Tycher. In the old Weehawken, on the cliffs above the waterfront, a vocal minority opposed to the Roseland development is worried about the park. ''I don't know why people down there aren't screaming their heads off,'' said Mary Ciuffitelli, a 26-year resident of the town. ''I grew up in New Jersey, so I want to know what's under my feet.'' Correction: October 26, 2006, Thursday An article on Oct. 2 about a new housing development in Weehawken, N.J., erroneously attributed a distinction to it. It is not in fact the first chromium-contaminated site in New Jersey to be reclaimed for residential development; several sites in Jersey City and Bayonne were cleaned up, and housing built on them, in the 1980's and 1990's."
"It was his infant son's cries, gasping and insistent, that first woke Salif Oudrawogol one night last month. The smell hit him moments later, wafting into the family's hut, a noxious mélange reminiscent of rotten eggs, garlic and petroleum. Mr. Oudrawogol went outside to investigate. Beside the family's compound, near his manioc and corn fields, he saw a stinking slick of black sludge. ''The smell was so bad we were afraid,'' Mr. Oudrawogol said. ''It burned our noses and eyes.'' Over the next few days, the skin of his 6-month-old son, Salam, bloomed with blisters, which burst into weeping sores all over his body. The whole family suffered headaches, nosebleeds and stomach aches. How that slick, a highly toxic cocktail of petrochemical waste and caustic soda, ended up in Mr. Oudrawogol's backyard in a suburb north of Abidjan is a dark tale of globalization. It came from a Greek-owned tanker flying a Panamanian flag and leased by the London branch of a Swiss trading corporation whose fiscal headquarters are in the Netherlands. Safe disposal in Europe would have cost about $300,000, or even twice that, counting the cost of delays. But because of decisions and actions made not only here but also in Europe, it was dumped on the doorstep of some of the world's poorest people. So far eight people have died, dozens have been hospitalized and 85,000 have sought medical attention, paralyzing the fragile health care system in a country divided and impoverished by civil war, and the crisis has forced a government shakeup. ''In 30 years of doing this kind of work I have never seen anything like this,'' said Jean-Loup Quéru, an engineer with a French cleanup company brought in by the Ivorian government to remove the waste. ''This kind of industrial waste, dumped in this urban setting, in the middle of the city, never.'' The tale of the sludge can be traced to July 2, when a rust-streaked tanker, the Probo Koala, arrived in Amsterdam after a lengthy stay in the Mediterranean. Leased by Trafigura, a global oil and metals trading company, it was pausing on its way to Estonia to unload what the company said was 250 tons of ''marslops'' or ''regular slops.'' That is the wash water from cleaning a ship's holds, which would normally be laced with oil, gasoline, caustic soda or other chemicals. Amsterdam Port Services, a waste processing company, took the job, for about $15,000. But as workers unloaded the waste, they found problems, the company said. For one, the volume was much higher, more like 400 tons. For another, the seeping fumes of the waste sickened some of the Dutch workers. ''It was pitch black and had a heavy stench,'' said Luut Planting, a spokesman for Amsterdam Port Services. ''No one had ever seen similar waste.'' The company stopped unloading the sludge, ordered analyses and then informed the Amsterdam city authorities of the presence of hazardous waste, Mr. Planting said. The material and test results are currently under seal in the office of the Dutch public prosecutor, which has opened a criminal investigation. A statement posted on Trafigura's Web site says that tests performed on material discharged by the Probo Koala in Abidjan by a laboratory in Rotterdam showed that the material was not toxic. ''Contrary to speculation in the media and the activist communities about residue washings in a recent shipment to Côte d'Ivoire, tests conducted by the company and others show the washings themselves to have little or no toxicity,'' the statement says. As to the deaths and illness, the statement says, ''It is still unclear exactly what caused the tragedy.'' But the Rotterdam laboratory, Saybolt, has told Dutch news media the samples were not sealed, not properly marked and not wholly reliable. Lucas Reijnders, a chemist and professor of environmental science at the University of Amsterdam, said he had seen the results of an analysis done in Ivory Coast by a lab there, Ciapol, on samples taken from the Probo Koala before the dumping. The analysis showed extremely high levels of caustic soda; mercaptans, a kind of sulfur compound; and hydrogen sulfide, he said. The last, he said, is a volatile compound that ''smells of rotten eggs, but at high concentrations you can no longer smell it because it paralyzes your nervous system.'' ''It's very lethal and acts very rapidly,'' he added. The mix, he said, was suggestive of oil refining. Exactly where the waste originated remains unclear. A spokesman for Trafigura, Jan Maat, said the Probo Koala had served in the Mediterranean ''as a floating storage tank'' and had taken on loads from several different ships, but he declined to give details. Reports in the Dutch press said the Probo Koala had been secretly used as a floating refinery during the summer, when selling gasoline had become unusually profitable. Mr. Maat denied that. ''This is absolutely untrue,'' he said. After analyzing the waste, Amsterdam Port Services told Trafigura's London office that the price to treat and dispose of it would now be much more expensive, close to $300,000. Trafigura, which in 2005 had revenue of $28 billion dollars, balked at the cost. ''It was so much higher than the first price,'' said Mr. Maat. It would also have meant staying an extra day, costing $45,000 in port fees and a penalty of some $300,000 for arriving late in Estonia, he said. A brief standoff ensued, but the Probo Koala was able to leave Amsterdam two days later after taking back all of its waste with the permission of the Dutch authorities. ''We have never handed back or refused waste before,'' said Mr. Planting. ''But the crux was that Trafigura refused to pay. If they had, the material would have been treated and there would have been no problem.'' From Amsterdam, the Probo Koala sailed to Estonia and took on Russian oil products. After delivering them to Nigeria, it continued to Abidjan, where it arrived on Aug. 19. Mr. Maat said Trafigura's London office had advised the Ivory Coast port authorities and the Transportation Ministry that it was delivering chemical waste requiring special treatment and close supervision, and hired a local company, Tommy. ''We were informed that four companies there could handle it,'' said Mr. Maat. ''One of them was Tommy. Clearly this has not been a fortunate choice.'' He also said, ''We do not acknowledge responsibility for the dumping of the waste without treating it.'' French, Dutch and British toxic-waste experts and oil traders said it can be easily ascertained that Ivory Coast has no facilities capable of handling high-level toxic waste. Tommy hired more than a dozen tanker trucks, into which it pumped the sludge. The trucks fanned out, at night, to at least 18 sites across the city, according to witnesses in several neighborhoods where the material was dumped, as well as the French cleanup crew. Several tankerloads went to the Abidjan landfill, in a community called Akouedo. Residents there are accustomed to foul odors, but knew something was particularly bad about the new material. They chased and surrounded one of the tanker trucks, forcing the driver to flee on foot, witnesses said. In other places, some trucks were simply abandoned by drivers fearful of being attacked as word of the illegal dumping crept out and public anger rose. Efforts to reach Tommy by telephone were unsuccessful, and at least one of its executives has been jailed in Ivory Coast. Last week Jean-Baptiste Giassey, a 13-year-old schoolboy, rooted through garbage piled at Akouedo, near a team of workers from Tredi, the French environmental cleanup company that is gathering up the polluted trash, which is expected to be sent to France for proper disposal. Stinking mud oozed from the trash under his flimsy sandals, coating his feet and legs. He was looking for scraps of aluminum, which he would sell to traders for less than 25 cents a pound. He said he had been spending five or six hours a day at the dump, trying to earn enough money for new clothes. ''I don't know that it is dangerous,'' he said. ''I come here every day.'' At first the Ivorian government did not acknowledge that something was amiss, even though the rank smell was spreading through the streets of Abidjan. Officials say they suspect they will find more dump sites than the 18 identified so far. The spreading illnesses sparked violent demonstrations from a population convinced that government corruption was to blame for the dumping, and ultimately the furor forced the prime minister and his government to resign in September, though much of the government was reinstated later. Six Ivorians, one Nigerian and two European officials from Trafigura have been jailed so far in Ivory Coast. The risk of sickness from the waste has abated with evaporation, experts said. But there may be long-term effects of exposure. In Dgibi, a village on the northern outskirts of Abidjan where some of the waste landed, an impromptu clinic set up to examine people exposed to the waste has been seeing 200 patients a day. Most complain of nausea, headaches, skin sores and nosebleeds, said Stanislaus Dessi, a doctor at the clinic who works for the Ministry of Health. ''People are scared and confused,'' Dr. Dessi said. ''We try to calm them and give them medicine to treat whatever symptoms they have.'' The Probo Koala, back in Estonia, has been detained by the government there at the request of Ivory Coast. Greenpeace has filed criminal complaints in Amsterdam against Trafigura, Amsterdam Port Services and the Dutch environmental authorities. The Dutch government said it could not comment while criminal investigations were under way. There are no fewer than five investigations going on in Ivory Coast. The city of Amsterdam and the Dutch Parliament have begun their own inquiries. ''The whole procedure was illegal, first allowing the waste in, then pumping it back on board and letting the ship leave without any licenses,'' said Eco Matser, a chemist and expert in toxic waste at Greenpeace. Africa has long been a dumping ground for all sorts of things the developed world has no use for. ''This is the underbelly of globalization,'' said Jim Puckett, an activist at the Basel Action Network, an environmental group that fights toxic waste dumping. ''Environmental regulations in the north have made disposing of waste expensive, so corporations look south.''"
"If you stand outside the Holt family home late at night, after everyone has gone to sleep, with the sound of a soft wind drifting through the trees and the damp sweet smell of abundant grass heavy in the humid air, you can easily imagine what this area was like in the days of slavery. And then the quiet is broken by the sudden eruption of dogs barking and howling on nearby property, and you're reminded that the tiny population of blacks in Dickson County, even after all these years, is still frequently treated -- literally -- like garbage. The property adjacent to the Holt family home is a government-owned landfill. The howling dogs are housed in a pound right next to the landfill. The noise is a nuisance, but it's the least of the family's problems. Toxic chemicals from the landfill have polluted the pristine water that was once drawn from the Holt family well. Unaware that the water was contaminated, the family drank it for years. Now the Holts are convinced that the poisons that seeped for so long from the landfill into the groundwater are responsible for the potentially deadly diseases that have struck several members of the family. The Holts were not just unaware that their water was contaminated; they had been assured by federal environmental officials way back in 1991 that the water had been tested and was safe to drink. ''They told us,'' said Sheila Holt-Orsted, who grew up on the property, ''that the water wouldn't hurt us, and that we shouldn't worry about it.'' In fact, government records show that dangerous levels of trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected carcinogen, had been found in the water as early as 1988. The family drank the poisoned water for more than a dozen years after that. During that time, the government warned white families that the water had been contaminated and provided them with an alternate source of drinking water. The Holts, who are black, were left oblivious to the danger. Welcome to the world of environmental racism, a subject that doesn't get nearly enough attention. The Holts' property is on Eno Road, a quiet rustic area with an interesting history. Hundreds of acres of land along the road were acquired by blacks in the post-slavery period. Only recently freed, they were proud of being landowners. The Holts have lived in the community for many decades. Blacks make up just 4.5 percent of the Dickson County population, and they have always been clustered in the vicinity of Eno Road. This has been a great convenience for the whites, who have run the local governments. For six decades, the Eno Road community has been designated as the place for whites to dump their garbage. ''The city and county fathers singled out this small, rural and mostly black Eno Road community to locate their garbage dumps, landfills, transfer stations, toxic waste sites -- you name it,'' said Dr. Robert Bullard, director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University. ''These waste sites are all located on Eno Road.'' When I asked the mayor of Dickson County, Robert Stone, why that particular community had been chosen to absorb so much of the county's garbage, he said he couldn't respond because the Holts had filed a lawsuit against the county. He referred me to a lawyer, Eric Thornton, who asked why anyone would think it was peculiar to dump the garbage there. ''It has to be at some location,'' he said. He denied that race had anything to do with the selection process, noting that there were also whites who lived nearby. The ingestion of TCE, commonly used as a metal degreaser, has been associated with a variety of cancers, heart disease, impairment of the nervous system, stroke, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes and other extremely serious disorders. At various times, the concentration of TCE in the well water of the Holt family was 24 and 29 times as high as the maximum level of five parts per billion set by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Sheila Holt-Orsted has undergone six surgeries and chemotherapy for breast cancer. Her father was stricken with prostate cancer. During a conversation in her front yard, less than 50 feet from the landfill, she told me: ''My aunt, who lives next door, she had cancer. And then there was another neighbor who had cancer. I said, you know, 'Something is not right here.' '' Op-Ed Columnist"
"A bankrupt copper giant facing billions of dollars in pollution claims across the nation pretended for years to recycle metals while illegally burning hazardous waste in a notorious El Paso smelter, according to a newly released Environmental Protection Agency document. The agency, in a 1998 internal memorandum, said the company, Asarco, and its Corpus Christi subsidiary, Encycle, had a permit to extract metals from hazardous waste products but used that as a cover to burn the waste until the late 1990's, saving the high costs of proper disposal. Among the more than 5,000 tons the company was accused of misrepresenting as containing metals for reclamation were more than 300 tons of nonmetallic residues from the former Army chemical warfare depot at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal outside Denver. (It is not clear what the arsenal's material contained.) ''This activity, plain and simple, was illegal treatment and disposal of hazardous waste,'' the environmental agency said in the memorandum, long held confidential but recently obtained by two El Paso environmental groups opposed to the smelter. ''Encycle's own business records provide compelling evidence of sham recycling.'' There was no response to messages left for an Asarco spokeswoman at corporate offices in Tucson and for the El Paso plant manager. But a company history states, ''Asarco is committed to responsible management of our natural resources.'' Asarco was founded as the American Smelting and Refining Company in 1899 and was bought by Mexican interests in 1999. It has long faced complaints of contaminating broad swaths of downtown El Paso and borderland areas of Mexico with lead and other dangerous metals, and it has been the target of federal, state and local complaints involving at least 94 sites in 21 states. But although the environmental agency reached a landmark national $20 million cleanup and penalty settlement with Asarco in 1999, the details of the violations had never been disclosed. The El Paso plant was shut down in 1999, but the company is now seeking permission to reopen it. The long-confidential records were obtained from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality through public information requests by the two citizens groups, the Get the Lead Out Coalition and the Sunland Park Grassroots Environmental Group, which provided copies to The New York Times. ''They were supposed to recycle reusable residues,'' said Heather McMurray, a teacher who requested the records. ''They just burned them.'' Ms. McMurray said the disclosure came as news to her and other activists who had been opposing Asarco for years with claims that pollutants released by the plant caused untold sickness. ''How could this not have been made public before?'' said State Senator Eliot Shapleigh, Democrat of El Paso, who has long campaigned against the company and tracks developments on his Web site. ''I was not aware of it.'' Mr. Shapleigh added: ''In the American West, the modern trail of tears is the lead and arsenic left behind from Asarco.'' Michael D. Goodstein, who as a Justice Department environmental lawyer helped negotiate the 1999 settlement with Asarco, said the E.P.A. memorandum detailing Asarco's violations was for internal use and was not meant to become public. ''This was the E.P.A. position, and it was addressed in the enforcement actions and the settlement approved by the judge,'' Mr. Goodstein, who is out of the government, said in an interview. Although the 122-page settlement does not spell out misdeeds, it commits Asarco to lengthy remedies, including the proper recycling of hazardous waste. Terry Clawson, a spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, also said, ''You can't say this was unknown.'' Mr. Clawson pointed to an E.P.A. news release in 1999 that announced the settlement of federal and state claims against Asarco. But the release, while citing the company for ''failing to properly manage hazardous waste and otherwise engaging in unlawful recycling practices'' and accepting ''shipments of unmanifested hazardous waste,'' does not say specifically that the company burned the waste under a subterfuge. Although the company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it is also awaiting action from the Texas commission on an application to renew smelting in El Paso, and it still faces a mountain of litigation and enforcement actions. As recently as August, the Justice Department filed a claim under the bankruptcy proceedings to assure Asarco's compliance with terms of the agreed-upon cleanup at Encycle. At the same time, Mr. Shapleigh said a tabulation showed that legal claims filed against Asarco amounted to more than $21 billion."
"First came news of a day-care center in South Jersey in a former thermometer factory. Then came criticism that unlicensed consultants had been hired by developers and polluters to determine how to clean up contaminated waste sites. And environmentalists expressed concern that the State Department of Environmental Protection did not know which contaminated sites needed cleaning the most, even though it was required by law to do so. In the face of these disclosures and criticisms, New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection, Lisa P. Jackson, told legislators on Monday of her plans to overhaul the department's $60 million cleanup program, which is responsible for monitoring more than 16,000 contaminated sites. Ms. Jackson said the plan -- which met with tempered praise from watchdog groups and former officials -- included prioritizing the sites requiring cleanup, creating a licensing board for environmental consultants, and adopting programs similar to those in Massachusetts that provide incentives for cleaning up sites within a year. ''I firmly believe that additional changes in how the D.E.P. manages and cleans up contaminated sites are definitely needed,'' Ms. Jackson said at the hearing, held by the State Senate Environmental Committee. Ms. Jackson was invited to testify as the panel began considering a bill that would require the Department of Health and Senior Services to set indoor air-quality standards for day-care centers or buildings used for educational purposes. That measure and several others were introduced after the discovery in April that a day-care center in Gloucester County, Kiddie Kollege, was operating at a former thermometer factory. Elevated levels of mercury were found in a third of the center's children and staff. ''Kiddie Kollege was a failure of government on every level,'' State Senator Henry P. McNamara, a Republican from Wyckoff, said. The state attorney general is currently investigating how a day-care center was allowed to open at the site, and the case has lead to a spate of lawsuits. Irene Kropp, the assistant commissioner of the environmental agency in charge of site remediation, said the agency would establish priorities by the spring, and, Ms. Jackson said the licensing of consultants could take from 18 months to two years. Senator Bob Smith, a Democrat of Piscataway who is chairman of the committee, said he was interested in learning more about the Massachusetts program, which includes a mandatory audit of cleanup sites and continuing education for environmental consultants. New Jersey's reliance on unlicensed consultants has drawn criticism from environmentalists. ''With the system we have now, polluters pick and pay for consultants,'' Jeff Tittel, director of the state chapter of the Sierra Club, said in an interview. ''If I'm a polluter and you're a consultant, you get a bigger bonus if you make sure my liability is less or my cleanup is cheaper or doesn't happen.'' And Marwan Sadat, chairman of Sadat Associates Inc., an environmental engineering firm in Trenton, said in an interview, ''If you go before the D.E.P. and make a whole report on a cleanup, you don't have to have any qualifications.'' Mr. Sadat, who was director of the environmental agency's division of waste management from 1981 to 1986, added: ''There are no regulations for licensing, for qualifications. None, zip, zero.'' For his part, Mr. Tittel said that those responsible for pollution ought to be required to set up escrow accounts that would pay for consultants hired by the department. ''People who are working for polluters are not working for the public,'' he said. New Jersey, with a long history of heavy industry and as a result the home of more federal Superfund sites than any other state in the country, has struggled to clean up the pollution left behind. In 1980, Jim Florio, the future governor who was then a congressman, was a sponsor of the federal Superfund law, a ranking of the nation's worst environmental disasters. In addition, the state's brownfield program, created in 1998 to oversee the cleanup and redevelopment of polluted industrial sites, has served as a model for Connecticut and other states. But over the years, New Jersey policies have also mirrored a national trend away from completely removing contaminants from sites and toward the practice of putting impermeable caps over polluted areas, a trend that has made redevelopment easier and less costly and, as a result, more palatable to the business community. During the administration of Gov. Christie Whitman, the staff of the environmental agency was cut 20 percent, and hours were reduced to 35 from 40 a week, said Bill Wolfe, a former department official who today is director of New Jersey Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a nonprofit watchdog group. The agency's site remediation program, which is responsible for overseeing cleanups, dropped to 500 employees from 600 in 1996, even as the department's responsibilities were expanded to include the regulation of solid and hazardous waste. ''The D.E.P. never recovered,'' Mr. Wolfe said. Indeed, Ms. Jackson said in an interview that current laws limit her agency's powers. ''We want the ability to say we want a site cleaned up to a stricter standard,'' she said."
"Most of the carnage -- the terrible illnesses and the premature deaths -- is hidden. ''The people in those agencies who issue the permits, and then do very little monitoring and very little enforcement in our communities, they don't go with us to the emergency rooms where the children are suffering from serious asthma attacks. And they certainly don't go with us to the funeral homes where we bury people who are 40 years old and have died of cancer. They don't see the terrible damage that this stuff is doing.'' Monique Harden, a lawyer and director of a human rights agency in New Orleans, was talking about a problem that will get no attention at all in the Congressional elections, which are primarily about foolishness and the compulsion to deceive. The evidence has been before us for decades that black people, other ethnic minorities and some poor whites have been getting sick and enduring horrible deaths from the filth that they breathe, eat, drink and otherwise ingest from the garbage dumps, landfills, incinerators, toxic waste sites, oil refineries, petrochemical plants and other world-class generators of pollution that have been deliberately and relentlessly installed in the neighborhoods where they live, work, worship and go to school. Two colossal environmental debacles occurred, for example, in West Anniston, Ala., a neighborhood that is mostly black and mostly poor. A chemical plant conveniently located there produced thousands of pounds of potentially deadly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) each year. For years after the danger was apparent, residents were left uninformed. Some were later found to have the highest concentrations of PCB's in their bloodstreams of anyone ever tested. But the PCB's from the chemical plant were just one of many risks faced by the residents. In 2003 the military began burning deadly chemical weapons stored at the Anniston Army Depot in West Anniston. Emissions associated with burning chemical weapons include dioxins, PCB's, furans, heavy metals and trace amounts of nerve and mustard gas agents. The Rev. Henry Sterling, a pastor in Anniston, told me with great sadness how he had buried his niece who had died from cancer when she was just 30, and then two days later had to bury two other women in their 20's, and then the following week two more women in their late 20's. He added, ''My secretary was from here, and she was just 32 when she died from cancer. We have young men dying, too. But during that short period it just happened to be all women. '' We've known -- or should have known -- since at least 1987, when a landmark study was published by the Commission on Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ, that wildly disproportionate numbers of hazardous waste sites have been placed in communities with large concentrations of black and Latino residents. Since then an enormous amount of data has been compiled showing that government and industry alike have used black and poor neighborhoods as dumping grounds for the vilest and most dangerous of pollutants. You go to these communities, where the air can be thick enough to make you gag, and you find that the rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke and the like are off the charts. The largest hazardous waste landfill in America is near the small, rural town of Emelle, in Sumter County, which is part of the so-called ''black belt'' of Alabama. It takes in hazardous materials from 48 states and some foreign countries. More than 70 percent of the Sumter County population, and more than 90 percent of the population of Emelle, is black. The systematic placement of garbage dumps, chemical plants, oil refineries and other hazardous facilities in communities inhabited primarily by blacks and other disadvantaged groups is nothing less than an unconscionable extension of the devastating Jim Crow policies that have existed in one form or another, legally or illegally, since slavery. More than 70 environmental, human rights and public health groups participated in a bus tour last week -- dubbed ''The Environmental Justice for All Tour'' -- that visited communities across the country that have suffered terrible damage from these blatantly discriminatory policies. The tour was enthusiastically received at each stop, but got hardly any attention from the larger society. The message to blacks and others struggling with these hideous policies could not have been clearer: we are not in the least interested in you. Op-Ed Columnist"
"A federal judge has rejected the city's claim that it is protected by law from being sued over the way it handled rescue and recovery operations at ground zero. The ruling opens the way for lawsuits by thousands of workers who say they were made sick by exposure to toxic substances during the 10-month cleanup. Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of United States District Court in Manhattan rejected the city's motion to dismiss the lawsuits. In a 99-page decision released yesterday afternoon, he stated that state and federal statutes do provide some immunity for the city, its private contractors and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for actions undertaken in response to an enemy attack. However, the judge said that protection is not universal and varies by time and place, making it necessary to hear the details of individual cases. ''The fact-intensive nature of the issue makes its resolution unsuitable for resolution by motion,'' Judge Hellerstein concluded. ''Discovery, additional proceedings and a more extensive factual record, and perhaps a trial, will be required.'' Michael A. Cardozo, the corporation counsel for the city, said in a statement that although the judge ruled that the legal case can proceed, he made it clear that the issue of immunity would be determined on a case-by-case basis. ''We believe that as the facts fully emerge, the complex decisions that were carefully and thoughtfully made during the months after 9/11 will demonstrate the enormous good work done by the city and its contractors, and the absence of any legal liabilities,'' Mr. Cardozo said. David Worby, the lawyer who is leading the legal action on behalf of the workers, called the decision a clear victory for the firefighters, police officers and construction workers who say they became sick after responding to the Sept. 11 crisis. ''The bottom line of what the court is trying to say is that these are not the kind of decisions for these heroes that should be settled by summary judgments,'' Mr. Worby said. ''They should have their day in court.'' Mr. Worby said that when he spoke to some of his clients after the decision was released, they cried. ''It all started with people telling them what they had was just a cough, and it's taken three years to prove that that was not true,'' he said. In his decision, Judge Hellerstein outlined proceedings in which up to 3,000 ailing workers would have a chance to describe what happened to them; whom they were working for at the time they got sick; when they were at ground zero; and what protective gear was available to them while on the site. In all, more than 8,000 workers have filed suit against the city and dozens of its contractors who worked on the cleanup of ground zero. The other cases would be heard in subsequent proceedings. While some of the cases could end up going to trial, the judge offered to appoint a special master, with the approval of the parties, who could engage in mediation and speed resolution of the claims. ''If even a minority of plaintiffs suffered serious injuries to their respiratory tracts arising from the acrid air of Sept. 11, their claims deserve to be heard when a recovery could make a difference to their lives,'' Judge Hellerstein wrote. James E. Tyrrell Jr., a lawyer with the Washington firm Patton Boggs who is leading the city's defense in this case, said the city was clearly disappointed that ''the court is not in a position to conclude that either all or some substantial portion of actions taken can be treated as being covered by immunity at this time.'' While partly rejecting the immunity claims by the city and the Port Authority, Judge Hellerstein dismissed the charges against Con Edison and Silverstein Properties, which had been named as defendants because they held leases on ground zero property. The judge ordered a conference to be held on Nov. 3 to consider the appointment of a special master and other issues. The city's substantial legal costs are being covered by a special captive insurance company that was created when Congress established a $1 billion insurance fund in 2003."
"Globalization brings wealth and opportunity to many people around the world. But to poor slum dwellers in the failing state of Ivory Coast, it has brought horrible sickness and death after hazardous waste, shipped nearly halfway around the world, was stealthily dumped in backyards around Abidjan. This need not and should not have happened. As reported in Monday's Times by Lydia Polgreen and Marlise Simons, the waste -- a fuming mix of petrochemicals and caustic soda -- that started out in the Mediterranean and ended up in Africa could have been safely disposed of earlier in its journey. But Trafigura, the Swiss trading company that leased the tanker, balked at paying European prices. Instead, 85,000 people ended up seeking medical treatment, and at least eight have died. The details and legal responsibilities are still being sorted out. But the lesson is plain. Without strict, and strictly enforced, international rules on waste disposal, dangerous cargos will find the course of least resistance, least cost, and least regulation, scarring the lives of some of the world's poorest, worst governed and most defenseless people. This story began in July, when a Greek-owned Panamanian-flagged tanker, leased by Trafigura, stopped in Amsterdam and attempted to unload its waste. That fell through when a Dutch company that had contracted to do the job for $15,000 found far more noxious material in the ship's hold than it had been led to believe. Completing safe disposal there would instead cost $300,000, plus perhaps as much again in delays. That sent Trafigura looking for cheaper alternatives. But for a company that had revenues of $28 billion last year, it was not a prohibitive price -- especially considering what happened. The ship moved on to several more ports, ending up in Abidjan, where Trafigura hired a local disposal company that did the nocturnal backyard dumping. Trafigura says the Ivoirian authorities told it that the local company could do the job safely. If that is true, those officials were recklessly incompetent. In any case, a stronger system of international regulations -- backed up by a threat of fines or other penalties -- might have forced Trafigura to think twice about whom it was hiring. Unless such regulations are tightened and reliably enforced, the sick and the dead in Ivory Coast will have suffered for nothing. And the whole story will soon be repeated in some other country where costs are low, rules are slack, and, as an inevitable result, human life is cheap. Editorial"
"A City Council committee heard sharply differing views yesterday on a bill that would require makers of computers, televisions, digital music players and other electronic devices to set up a free ''take-back'' system to collect and recycle or reuse the devices. The bill would let manufacturers design the system but would require them to meet minimum collection rates; companies would get double credit for devices donated to a school or nonprofit group. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Action said the bill would shift the cost of handling electronic waste away from taxpayers and would protect sanitation workers and the public from toxic chemicals released when the devices are crushed or incinerated. The Consumer Electronics Association said the issue should be handled nationally or regionally. SEWELL CHAN (NYT)"
"The escalating debate over the relative risks and benefits of eating seafood veered toward the benefits this week. Two authoritative scientific assessments -- one from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the other from researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health -- concluded that for most people the health benefits of eating finfish and shellfish clearly exceed any risks from contamination by toxic chemicals, heavy metals or microbes. Even vulnerable groups, like pregnant women and young children, could benefit by eating more fish if they avoided the most contaminated species. Both studies were financed by federal agencies, insulating them from commercial influences. The Institute of Medicine panel judged seafood to be a good source of high-quality protein that is low in saturated fat and rich in many vitamins and minerals. It found that eating fish can reduce the risk of heart disease, though whether this comes from substituting lean fish for fatty meats or from the protective effects of fish oils remains uncertain. Infants whose mothers ate fish while pregnant might also benefit from longer gestation and better vision and brain development. Pregnant or breast-feeding women and young children should avoid large predatory fish -- shark, swordfish, tilefish and king mackerel -- and limit their intake of albacore tuna to avoid exposure to contaminants. The Harvard study was even more emphatic on the virtues of seafood. It found that eating a modest amount of fish reduces the risk of death from coronary heart disease by 36 percent. The lead author said he was surprised to find how little evidence of harm exists and concluded that the benefits ''greatly outweigh the risks,'' a fact that has been ''lost on the public.'' However, it is dismaying how many important questions remain unresolved. Evidence suggesting that people who have suffered heart attacks might ward off future attacks by eating seafood is weaker than previously thought. It remains unclear whether consuming seafood might reduce the risk of diabetes, cancer or Alzheimer's, as some studies suggest. Reliable data on the distribution of important contaminants is lacking. And there is little evidence on how the beneficial effects of seafood might counteract the risk from contaminants. While the scientists address those questions, consumers could use help. Better labeling on packages of fish or at the fish counter could make it easier to figure out which fish to eat and which to avoid. Editorial"
"Every time her neighbors treat their lawns with standard chemical herbicides, Caryl Schonbrun fears for her life. Ms. Schonbrun, 52, has multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome, which she says leaves her vulnerable to whiffs of substances that her system can no longer tolerate. She said that she was sensitive to ingredients in herbicides as well as pesticides, and that exposure to the chemicals could put her body into anaphylactic shock. ''It's an illness that you have to depend on the kindness of neighbors and friends and hope for the best,'' she said. But Ms. Schonbrun said she had found that was not enough and turned to lobbying the City Council, the mayor, the neighborhood mediator and anyone else she thought might be able to help. Her goal was to get neighbors either to refrain from using such chemicals or to notify her before applying them. Her condition and her campaign have left local officials and neighbors grappling with just how much responsibility they all have in coping with one woman's ailment. ''It's a pretty complicated situation,'' said Diggs Brown, a Fort Collins councilman who has met with Ms. Schonbrun. ''How do you balance the rights of one neighbor who is using legal chemicals on their lawn on private property and somebody who apparently has a chemical sensitivity?'' Just the mention of chemical sensitivity can be controversial, as there remains widespread doubt in the general medical community about whether it is a real diagnosis. Even the term ''multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome'' is polarizing in the medical and environmental health communities. Ms. Schonbrun said that she had been classified as ''disabled with chemical injury'' and that she received disability checks. ''The bottom line is that the condition is very much in dispute,'' said Dr. Edward B. Holmes, director of the Occupational and Environmental Health Clinic at the University of Utah. ''There seems to be, in my experience, a significant number of people that have this kind of conglomeration of symptoms that fit into a pattern strongly with psychiatric conditions.'' Dr. Holmes said that in rare cases someone might have a true allergy to a specific chemical. On the other side of the debate are specialists like Dr. Claudia S. Miller, professor of environmental medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, who said practitioners were hearing about more cases of chemical sensitivities. ''There is no reliable prevalence data because the illness presents in such varied ways,'' Dr. Miller said in an e-mail message. ''But estimates of the number of persons who report having multiple intolerances that they recognize and that cause them to rearrange their lives ranges from 3 to 6 percent of the population.'' Dr. Miller said chemical sensitivities or intolerances could be caused by a specific exposure to a toxic substance or by a number of exposures. There is no known cure. Often, people with severe chemical sensitivities remove themselves from urban areas completely, but Ms. Schonbrun said she could not face such isolation and did not want to be too far from her family or health care facilities. After her diagnosis six years ago, Ms. Schonbrun left her job as a nurse in San Diego and moved with her husband, Bob, to Tucson, where they stayed for a year. When she became even sicker, the couple moved to Fort Collins, a college town of about 130,000 with strong agrarian roots, to build a ''safe'' house with features that include an elaborate venting system and a tar-free roof to allow her to live as free of offending chemicals as possible. Ms. Schonbrun has added her name to the Colorado Department of Agriculture's registry of pesticide-sensitive people so she will be notified and can stay indoors when there is any commercial spraying. Some people question the Schonbruns' choice to relocate to their tidy and rapidly expanding subdivision with farms and ranches close by. ''With a condition like that, they choose to move into a residential area,'' said Curt Richards, who lives across the street from the Schonbruns and said that the dispute had escalated to the point that he had obtained a restraining order against Mr. Schonbrun. ''The bottom line is, we're not breaking any laws. We have modified how we take care of our property that requires more of my time and money, but that's not good enough.'' Ms. Schonbrun said she had twice had to call for an ambulance when her neighbors used herbicides she could not tolerate. The Schonbruns bought the first batch of nontoxic herbicides for some neighbors, including Mike Cada, who lives next door. ''I'm willing to do it as long as it's effective,'' Mr. Cada said, noting that the nontoxic mixture cost at least 40 percent more than traditional herbicides. No local ordinances require private citizens to notify neighbors when they apply pesticides. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, six states have laws that address overspraying and improper use of pesticides around humans(especially children); two others are considering such laws. ''It's been said that people with this condition are the new homeless,'' Ms. Schonbrun said. ''We were lucky enough to build a nontoxic home, but it's still a never-ending struggle to live in a safe all-around environment.'' FORT COLLINS JOURNAL"
"More than 2.5 million cubic yards of contaminated mud will be dredged from Onondaga Lake, near Syracuse, under a consent decree between the state and Honeywell International that was announced yesterday. The $451 million project will take about a decade and is considered one of the largest industrial cleanups in the country. Honeywell's predecessor, Allied-Signal, was sued by the state several years ago in an attempt to force the company to clean up the lake. Onondaga, which is four and a half miles long, contains high levels of mercury, benzene and other hazardous substances. ANTHONY DEPALMA (NYT)"
"Mismanagement, negligence and fraud by government agencies and private companies led to the dumping of a highly toxic cocktail of petrochemical waste in Ivory Coast in August, says a government report released there on Thursday. At least 10 people died and thousands were sickened after chemical waste pumped from a tanker chartered by Trafigura, a huge petroleum trading company based in the Netherlands, was dumped across Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast, in the main landfill and near poor neighborhoods. Citing the ''lack of rigorous management, failure to observe professional ethics and nonapplication of regulations,'' the report concluded that officials at the city's port and in several government ministries responsible for monitoring the shipping and handling of waste and petroleum had allowed the chain of events that led to the dumping, despite repeated red flags. The waste arrived in Abidjan on Aug. 19 aboard the Probo Koala, a Greek-owned tanker flying a Panamanian flag and leased by Trafigura. The tanker carried a toxic mix of chemicals that the ship had already tried to dispose of in Amsterdam in July, saying the waste was ordinary slop from cleaning the tanks of petroleum products. But workers in Amsterdam's port refused to take the waste for the initial price, $15,000, saying it was toxic and would require special disposal. Instead of paying the more than $300,000 it would cost to dispose of the waste in Europe, the ship sailed a circuitous route that included stops in Estonia and Nigeria, eventually arriving in Abidjan, where a subsidiary of Trafigura, Puma Energie, arranged to have the waste disposed of by Tommy, a local company. The report identified Tommy, which had agreed to dispose of the waste for just $20,000, and its manager, Salomon Ugborugbo, as the main actors responsible for the dumping. It said the company had ''neither the qualifications, the competence or the technical ability to treat this waste.'' The report said that Tommy ''was created during the same period when the Probo Koala left Holland for the Ivory Coast,'' and that it ''had all appearances of a shell company created for the circumstance.'' Before the waste arrived, Mr. Ugborugbo wrote an electronic message to a Trafigura official, saying that he had found a place ''outside the city called 'Akwedo' where he would dump the products,'' the report said. The city landfill at Akouedo is surrounded by poor neighborhoods and frequented by thousands of people who make a living picking recyclable items from the trash. Once the waste arrived, Tommy hired 12 tanker trucks, paying about $250 for each, and sent them to dump the material, the report said. But the material was dumped in more than a dozen sites across the city. Trafigura said in a statement on Thursday that it was aware of the report, but was not ready to comment on it. The company said it ''will continue to cooperate fully with all relevant authorities investigating this matter.'' This month, Trafigura appointed a prominent British lawyer, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, to investigate the Probo Koala dumping. Trafigura has already said that it complied with local and international laws, and that its own analysis of the chemicals on the ship showed that they were not toxic. But independent experts, including one at the University of Amsterdam who examined test results from waste samples, disagreed, saying the analysis showed extremely high levels of caustic soda; mercaptans, a kind of sulfur compound; and hydrogen sulfide. Mr. Ugborugbo, who is Nigerian, has been jailed in Ivory Coast pending criminal charges, with two European officials from Trafigura and several Ivorian businessmen. The government report released Thursday had been requested by the country's prime minister and is not related to the criminal inquiry, which is incomplete."
"A FLORIDA couple who went to a doctor for Botox in 2004 and instead received injections of botulin, the deadly toxin that causes botulism, may have received almost 3,000 times the estimated lethal dose of the toxin, according to a new report in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The couple got botulism but survived. The report said regulators should tighten the rules surrounding sales of this toxin to prevent such incidents from happening again. ''The issue we have is that there is an amount of toxin which one could buy fairly freely that could be used in illegitimate ways,'' said Dr. Christopher R. Braden, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and one of the authors of the JAMA report. ''There is quite a market for this stuff.'' Raw botulinum toxin causes botulism, which can result in paralysis and death. Botox, which uses a purified form of the toxin that does not induce the disease, temporarily paralyzes the muscles underneath wrinkles to smooth skin. Medical experts consider Botox extremely safe when used properly. ''When a doctor opens a vial of genuine licensed Botox, there is really no serious risk,'' said Dr. Jeremy Sobel, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C. and one of the authors of the JAMA report. ''But the people in Florida were injected with botulinum toxin, one of the most toxic substances, if not the most toxic substance known to man.'' Douglas S. Ingram, the chief administrative officer of Allergan Inc., the maker of Botox, said consumers can ensure that they are getting the real government-approved drug by choosing a licensed, trained doctor and by asking to see the Botox vial, which bears a special hologram. Theoretically, pure botulinum toxin is not easily obtainable. Its possession, transfer and use are regulated by the Select Agent Program of the C.D.C. Any entity that wants to transfer more than 500 micrograms of botulinum toxin -- an amount smaller than a pencil eraser -- must notify the program and receive approval to do so. But to facilitate legitimate scientific research, sales of less than 500 micrograms of botulinum toxin do not have to be approved or registered with the program. The JAMA report said regulators should lower that threshold, pointing out that the Florida case involved only one vial containing 100 micrograms of the toxin. Yet that could be enough to kill more than 14,000 adults if injected in equal amounts, JAMA said. In November 2004, Dr. Eric Kaplan and his wife, Bonnie, of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., went to a local clinic for Botox injections. Bach McComb, an osteopath whose license had been suspended, instead injected them with research-grade botulinum toxin obtained from a California company that makes anthrax, cholera and diphtheria for medical research, according to court documents. As a result of the injections of the toxin, which was not intended for human use, the Kaplans incurred $1.3 million in medical bills and are still suffering from health problems, according to their lawyer.

"A common mineral similar to rust fashioned into a powder of tiny crystals could provide a simple, inexpensive method for removing hazardous levels of arsenic from drinking water, researchers at Rice University in Houston are reporting today. That would help reduce the risk of cancer for tens of millions of impoverished villagers in China and Southeast Asia, where high levels of arsenic occur naturally in many water supplies, the researchers said in telephone interviews. Arsenic contamination is also a threat to water supplies in parts of Latin America, Africa and the United States, where the Environmental Protection Agency this year reduced allowable arsenic levels in municipal water systems to 10 parts per billion, down from 50 parts per billion. The research, being reported in the journal Science, is the latest of numerous investigations into the environmental uses of nanotechnology, the manipulation of materials so tiny they are measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter. At such small scales, common materials often begin to exhibit novel behaviors. In this case, the researchers made crystals of the rustlike mineral, magnetite. They found that when the crystals were smaller than 40 nanometers wide, they were much more sensitive to low-strength magnetic fields than would have been expected based on the behavior of larger particles. At 12 nanometers wide, the researchers found, the magnetite particles could bind up to 100 times as much arsenic as the larger iron particles currently used in filters, yet still be extracted from test liquids with inexpensive magnets widely used as computer components. While the particles' performance has been tested only in laboratories, the researchers said it seemed likely that removing arsenic could be as simple as pouring a small amount of magnetite powder into a pot of well water and waiting briefly while bound arsenic was pulled to the bottom by a simple magnet. ''This should come out costing one to two cents a day for a family of four in the developing world,'' said Mason B. Tomson, a professor of engineering at Rice who was a co-author of the report. Mr. Tomson added that the process would leave a small amount of arsenic-laced residue, enough to fill a cooking bowl in a year, that villagers would have to collect and dispose of, probably in landfills. Communities with centralized water systems might use filters rather than magnets to collect the particles because such technology is already in place to collect contaminants, said Vicki L. Colvin, a chemistry and chemical engineering professor who is director of the Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology at Rice. The researchers said further research was needed to determine whether the magnetite would be an improvement on other nanoscale minerals already used in such systems, including zirconium, aluminum, iron and manganese compounds. Even if Mr. Tomson's cost estimates are correct, researchers still have to demonstrate that the technology can be used safely. For example, no one knows the risks of the arsenic residues' being consumed by accident or of their leaching from landfills back into water supplies. The first field tests of the material are being planned for Brownsville, Tex., next year, as is a study in India, the researchers said. Competing technologies, including the use of plants to draw arsenic from the ground and specialized clay filters, are also being explored. Experts in arsenic contamination who were not involved in the Rice research said it sounded intriguing. ''All of the arsenic removal systems so far require filtration of some sort,'' said Alexander van Geen, a senior research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. Such systems perform poorly if not properly maintained and may become infected with bacteria and other microbes, Mr. van Geen and others said. But Mr. van Geen said a simple solution was to drill wells into deeper water supplies that are free of arsenic. He has estimated that most villages in Bangladesh, the country with the most wide-ranging problems, could be supplied with clean water through a $50 million investment in deeper wells."
"RENEE ST. DENIS is prospecting. Scanning the rows of the latest arrivals of discarded computers and other electronic products at Hewlett-Packard's 200,000-square-foot recycling plant, she searches for precious metals. A co-worker calls out, ''Renee, check this out -- an arcade console!'' Ms. St. Denis, who directs Hewlett's recycling operations in the Americas, dashes to the game station towering above boxes of computers, keyboards and other junk. Ms. St. Denis points out that this plant, which is in Roseville, Calif., and Hewlett's other recycling operation, in Nashville, process 1.5 million pounds of electronics a month. The materials that they sort through are richer in precious metals than ore from a mine. Hewlett collects 8 to 10 ounces of gold, silver, palladium and other precious metals per ton of ''ore,'' compared with 6 ounces per ton in a typical extractive mine. ''We all want these valuable resources put back into the economy in some way, shape or form,'' she said. Ms. St. Denis is at the forefront of a major behavioral shift among electronics manufacturers. Many of them are taking more financial responsibility for the recovery and recycling of the goods they make and sell. They are also creating products with fewer toxic materials, and in some cases with biomass-based materials, so that the equipment can be more easily reused, recycled or decomposed in landfills. Companies contend that the upfront investment in greener product design and recycling can pay off down the road -- by avoiding regulatory fines, averting shareholder complaints and lawsuits, and catering to the demands of customers who want to use greener products. Necessity is behind much of the invention. The European Union passed several environmental directives in recent years. One mandate, which takes effect in July, severely restricts the six deadliest materials used in making most electronic equipment: lead, mercury, a carcinogenic form of chromium, cadmium and two polybrominated flame retardants (PBB and PBDE). The mandate applies to products sold in the European Union. But many multinational manufacturers anticipate that other countries will soon follow suit with equally strict laws, so they are rolling out products to meet the most rigorous standards. ''The trend is for more and more regulations,'' said Mark Newton, the head of Dell's environmental affairs group on product design. ''When you're a global company, you need to have a global solution. And if you wait to make changes in your products it can be extremely expensive.'' For Dell, redesigning products to be more ecological has been a ''net gain,'' Mr. Newton said. Lead, for example, is used in cathode-ray-tube monitors for TV's and older computers to protect users from exposure to X-rays. Most companies have already eliminated or reduced lead in computer monitors. Sony has replaced lead solder with a tin-silver-copper alloy. Sony, Panasonic, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and others have phased out lead in some cases by replacing cathode-ray tubes with liquid-crystal displays. Matching the properties of lead and other toxic materials, however, is no minor challenge. Lead has a higher melting temperature than most alternatives, which means it can withstand more heat. Mark Small, senior vice president for environmental safety and health at Sony, said it took six years to master lead-free solder. ''In the short term, it's more expensive and more difficult to work with than lead solder,'' he said. ''But we're motivated by the long-term environmental benefits and compliance issues.'' Most major manufacturers banned polybrominated flame retardants -- some have been linked to damage in the hormonal and skeletal systems in people -- from their products several years ago, well ahead of the European Union's directive. Some companies are starting to use recycled polyethylene. Hewlett-Packard reuses polyethylene (from its inkjet printers and from water and soda bottles) in the carriage covers of some of its Scanjet scanners. One of the most intriguing areas of green design is what some call the hydrocarbon-to-carbohydrate revolution: substituting petroleum-based plastics with biopolymers made from corn and other plants. The Japanese companies NEC Corporation, Unikita and NTT DoCoMo have developed cellphones with casings from bio-based plastics like polylactic acid reinforced with kenaf fiber. While biomass-based alternatives easily meet standards in cold-food packaging, making the grade for electronics housings is much more difficult. John Dorgan, a professor of chemical engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who specializes in polymers, said that many of the bio-based acids are brittle. And some compounds that are added to strengthen the biopolymers negate their ecological benefits. Another problem with biopolymers is their heat intolerance. Case in point: A group of Hewlett's scientists developed a prototype printer with a polylactic acid shell. Last summer, John Frey, Hewlett's manager for corporate environment strategies, showed the printer at a meeting in Texas. He put it in the car trunk and drove to a meeting on a hot afternoon. When he arrived, he found the printer's shell had collapsed. While Hewlett continues to develop products with some parts made of recycled plastics, for now it has shelved its biomass-based product research and development. ''We must have a valid business reason for doing things, not just an environmental reason,'' Mr. Frey said. Manufacturers are also focusing their greening efforts on reducing the electronic waste they produce and that consumers discard. Electronic products make up the fastest-growing portion of the waste stream. Last year alone, more than 63 million computers in the United States were traded in for replacements or thrown out. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that more than two million tons of electronic waste ends up in landfills each year. TV's and computers are not harmful, but when burned or dumped, toxins in the products -- like lead, mercury and cadmium -- endanger health as well as air and water quality. While a combination of United States laws and regulations ban dumping electronic waste in domestic landfills, many recyclers and brokers export e-waste to mostly unregulated markets overseas. About 80 percent of computers and other electronics collected for recycling are dumped in landfills in developing countries, according to watchdog organizations and industry groups. Electronics manufacturers are getting little prodding from the United States government; it is the only industrialized nation that did not ratify the Basel Convention, which prohibits richer nations from exporting hazardous waste to poorer countries. Barbara Kyle, coordinator of the Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition's computer take-back campaign, said that until the United States signs on to the Basel treaty, e-waste will continue polluting communities overseas. ''All these efforts to do more recycling, if not accompanied by closing the door to exporting e-waste to the third world, will mean we're just adding to the problem of other countries that are in no position to deal with our waste,'' Ms. Kyle said. Another European order, which requires all electronics manufacturers to pay for the collection, disposal and recycling of their products sold within the European Union, has lately been echoed by several state laws in the United States. Together, they have provided an impetus for manufacturers to control their e-waste. Another reason for the greening trend among manufacturers is feisty shareholders. At Apple Computer, a shareholders'group drafted a resolution before the company's April 27 annual meeting demanding that the company extend its free iPod recycling program to all Apple products. The board, and ultimately the majority of shareholders, voted no. But a few days before the meeting, the company said in a press release that, starting in June, it would take back old computers, at no cost, when customers buy a new Apple computer online or at an Apple retailer. ALTERNATIVES"
"Making good on a vow that New York would act on its own if the federal government did not get tough on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday proposed one of the most stringent mercury standards in the nation. Under the draft proposal, New York would cut the level of mercury from electricity-generating stations in half by 2010. By 2015, the new state mercury standard would be toughened further, requiring a 90 percent reduction from current levels. The state rule would be significantly more restrictive than a federal mercury standard set last year by the Bush administration. Under the federal rule, power plants must decrease mercury emissions 70 percent by 2018. Another major difference is that the federal plan allows generators to trade pollution credits, while New York's does not. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has repeatedly disagreed with the Bush administration's environmental policies, and although he has said he would oppose regulations that could harm business in the state, he has been willing to push through tough environmental rules that have sometimes angered business interests. If the state's new mercury rule is carried out, it would complete a far-ranging and comprehensive set of controls over the four most damaging air pollutants from power plants. A 2003 state program curtails nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, which cause acid rain. Late last year, seeing the federal inaction on global warming, New York and six other northeastern states joined together to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change. ''By adopting these new standards, all coal-fired power plants in the state would be required to use pollution-control technologies to significantly reduce their mercury emissions,'' Mr. Pataki said in a statement released by his office yesterday. But forcing eight of the state's coal-burning power plants -- many of them in the western part of the state -- to install effective pollution control technologies will push up the already high cost of energy in New York. (Four other coal-fired plants currently have some of these technologies.) Mr. Pataki's office estimates that installing the scrubbers, particle filters and other equipment necessary for the plants to meet the new standards would add less than a dollar a month to an average residential electricity bill. Representatives of the power industry in the state said, however, that those calculations are inaccurate and the true cost to residential and industrial consumers is likely to be far higher than a dollar a month, though they did not give their own estimate. Gavin J. Donohue, president and chief executive of the Independent Power Producers of New York said the draft mercury rules could drive energy prices up so high that New York's efforts to attract and retain industry would be hampered. He criticized the governor's proposal for not allowing the trading of pollution credits, and he said the schedule for reductions is so aggressive that it could force power companies to simply shut down a coal-fired plant rather than pay to upgrade it. ''If you just go ahead and close a plant, what does this do to the grid from a reliability standpoint?'' Mr. Donohue said. Environmentalists, even those who had criticized Mr. Pataki for his reluctance to include mercury controls in a package of power plant rules adopted in 2003, welcomed yesterday's announcement. ''This is the proper mechanism to regulate a neurotoxin such as mercury,'' said Jason K. Babbie, an environmental analyst with the New York Public Interest Research Group. He supports the proposed rules, but said the timetable for reductions should be accelerated and brought more in line with other states. Katherine Kennedy, director of the Northeast Energy Project for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that eight other states -- including Connecticut and New Jersey -- have already moved to adopt mercury controls, and several of them cut deeper and move more quickly than the rules proposed by New York. But she said attempts to control mercury emissions by even a single state are important because mercury, unlike other air pollutants, tends to settle fairly quickly, and can be most dangerous in areas not far from the power plants that release them. Mercury is contained naturally in coal, and is released into the atmosphere when the coal is burned. Some forms of mercury then fall from the sky relatively quickly and settle on water and land. Microrganisms in the water convert it to a toxin called methylmercury that is harmful to humans. Once in the water, the mercury is absorbed by small organisms and worms. It builds up as the worms are eaten by small fish, which are then eaten by larger fish, in a process known as bio-magnification. Because fish from polluted lakes can contain harmful levels of mercury, restrictions have been imposed on eating fish from most New York lakes. Supporters of the national plan for trading pollution credits believe it is an effective but less costly approach than outright limits. But Ms. Kennedy said such an approach can create hot spots that pose a grave danger to local residents."
"A biologist studying wild songbirds in New York State has found that all 178 woodland birds he tested last year had unusually high levels of mercury in their blood and feathers, a sign that the toxic chemical has spread farther in the environment than previously thought. The biologist, David C. Evers, who is also executive director of the Biodiversity Research Institute, a nonprofit ecological organization in Gorham, Me., said that his preliminary findings challenged existing perceptions about how far mercury travels, how it interacts with the environment and how it affects various forms of wildlife -- all with worrisome implications for people. While mercury has often been found in lakes and streams and in fish, Dr. Evers's work documents the unexpected presence of the chemical in birds that do not live on water and never eat fish. ''Impacts on biological diversity usually show impacts on human health,'' Dr. Evers said in a telephone interview. ''If these birds are having trouble, that should be a very good indicator of a risk to our own well-being and health as well.'' Catherine H. Bowes, Northeast mercury program manager for the National Wildlife Federation, called the results of the songbird study ''eye opening'' and said they helped expand understanding of mercury contamination. ''It makes a compelling case for reducing mercury pollution from local sources, as New York is doing,'' Ms. Bowes said. In May, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed cutting mercury emissions from New York power plants in half by 2010, setting standards that would be substantially more stringent than new federal regulations on mercury. State environmental officials are drawing up regulations, and then will take public comments before adopting them. The National Wildlife Federation will include Dr. Evers's study in a national report later this summer. The study will also be formally presented at an international conference on mercury pollution scheduled for Madison, Wis., next month. The songbird study provides a broader assessment of the mercury hazard in wooded areas of New York and throughout the northeastern United States than has previously been conducted. The presence of mercury in lakes and streams is already well documented, and the New York Department of Health advises people to restrict the consumption of any freshwater fish caught in most of the state to no more than one meal a week. But Dr. Evers is one of the first scientists to test for wildlife mercury contamination beyond fish. He began his work in this area in 1998 and found that common loons, which eat fish, had highly elevated levels of mercury that made them lethargic and caused their reproductive rates to drop. He then decided to study songbirds, which never eat fish. In particular, he wanted to study the wood thrush, a small bird with a distinctive song that was once common throughout the Northeast. The population of wood thrushes has declined 45 percent in recent decades. It was once thought that destruction of the bird's forest habitat was responsible for the decline. But Dr. Evers now suspects that mercury contamination might be a factor, along with the wide-ranging negative effects of acid rain on the forests. Last year the Nature Conservancy, concerned about mercury contamination in the Adirondacks and Catskills and its effect on the ecosystem, commissioned Dr. Evers and the Biodiversity Institute to undertake a pilot study in New York State. He netted songbirds at nine sites, including areas near some of New York City's upstate reservoirs. (Although the Department of Health fish advisory extends to the reservoirs, regular sampling by city officials has not detected any mercury in the water.) Much of the mercury that is causing problems in New York comes from coal-burning power plants, including those in Ohio and other states in the Midwest. Smokestack emissions from those plants tend to drift eastward. The airborne mercury eventually falls to earth, settling in lakes and streams where it is transformed into methyl mercury, which is toxic. The chemical then enters the food chain through worms and tiny creatures that live on lake bottoms. They are eaten by small fish, which then become prey for larger fish. The amount of mercury is magnified as it goes from smaller species to larger ones. Dr. Evers's work suggests that when mercury falls on land, it is absorbed by soil and by fallen leaves that are consumed by worms and insects. Songbirds then feed on the bugs, absorbing the mercury. While all the birds he tested last year had mercury in their blood, wood thrushes had the most, Dr. Evers said, an average of 0.1 parts per million. That is below the federal safe standard for fish (0.3 p.p.m.) but high enough to affect the birds' reproductive cycle. With fewer songbirds to eat potentially harmful insects, the state's forests would be at greater risk for damage by gypsy moths and other pests, Dr. Evers said. Beyond that, mercury leaching into soil could find its way into the food chain in ways that are still unknown, he said. This summer, again with support from the Nature Conservancy and the Biodiversity Research Institute, Dr. Evers has expanded his sampling range to cover 33 sites in New York and across the Northeast. ''That starts to get us to the point where we can provide solid scientific findings to public policymakers who will have to decide what to do about mercury,'' he said. The project has also taken blood samples this year from nesting bald eagles. Tim Tear, senior scientist and manager of the Nature Conservancy's global conservation approach team, said that while last year's pilot study did not provide conclusive evidence, it ''certainly gives us confidence that our early hypotheses'' about the deposition of mercury on land are correct, warranting further study."
"As Israel continues the bombing campaign that has turned parts of Lebanon into rubble, environmentalists are warning of widespread and lasting damage. Spilled and burning oil, along with forest fires, toxic waste flows and growing garbage heaps have gone from nuisances to threats to people and wildlife, they say, marring a country traditionally known for its clean air and scenic greenery. Many of Lebanon's once pristine beaches and much of its coastline have been coated with a thick sludge that threatens marine life. As smoke billowed overhead on Friday, turning day into dusk, Ali Saeed, a resident, recounted how war has changed this small industrial town about 15 miles south of Beirut. Most people have left, he said. It is virtually impossible to drive on the roads, and almost everyone hides behind sealed windows. ''There's nowhere to run,'' Mr. Saeed said, showing off the black speckles on his skin that have turned everything white here into gray. ''It's dripping fuel from the sky.'' A large oil spill and fire caused by Israeli bombing have sent an oil slick traveling up the coast of Lebanon to Syria, threatening to become the worst environmental disaster in the country's history and engulfing this town in smoke. ''The escalating Israeli attacks on Lebanon did not only kill its civilians and destroy its infrastructure, but they are also annihilating its environment,'' warned Green Line, a Lebanese environmental group, in a statement issued Thursday. ''This is one of the worst environmental crises in Lebanese history.'' The most significant damage has come from airstrikes on an oil storage depot at the edge of Jiyeh on July 13 and 15. Oil spewed into the Mediterranean Sea and a fire erupted that has been burning ever since. Four of the plant's six oil storage containers have burned completely, spilling at least 10,000 tons of thick fuel oil into the sea initially, and possibly up to 15,000 more in the weeks since. A fifth tank burst into flames on Thursday, residents said, adding to a smoke cloud that has spewed soot and debris miles away. The fire is so hot that it has melted rail cars into blobs and turned the sand below into glass. Engineers are concerned that a sixth tank still untouched by the fire could soon explode, making the situation even graver. The prevailing winds and currents have swept the oil northward up the coast of Lebanon, and on Friday it reached the coast of Syria, Environment Ministry officials said. ''You can't swim in the water anymore, it's all black,'' Mr. Saeed said. ''This is like the Exxon Valdez spill in America,'' he said, speaking of the environmental damage caused when a tanker ran aground and spilled about 40,000 tons of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989. Lebanon's coast is an important nesting ground for the green sea turtle, an endangered species, as well as a spawning ground for some Mediterranean fish. Turtle eggs begin hatching in July, but with the oil slick coating most of the area, baby turtles will have a far smaller chance of making it to deeper waters and surviving, environmentalists say. The oil slick is also threatening bluefin tuna that migrate to the eastern Mediterranean this time of year. The Environment Ministry sent crews to various parts of the country this week to assess the damage and begin the cleanup, a spokeswoman said. But the oil slick has quickly proven beyond the government's limited capacity to deal with the problem. The ministry estimates cleanup alone will cost upwards of $200 million, a major sum in a country with a gross domestic product of around $21 billion, but experts warn the bill could run even higher. Jordan has offered to send experts to provide technical assistance, and Kuwait has pledged to send material and equipment to help clean up the spill. Brush fires in many parts of the country have been an equally pressing concern as they rage unabated. Firefighters and forestry workers cannot move around for fear of being targets, and resources are being used to help refugees. ''In Israel there are planes taking care of forest fires, but in Lebanon these fires are not being extinguished or even noticed because our priorities have shifted from the environment to relief and humanitarian work,'' said Mounir Abou Ghanem, director general of the Association for Forest Development and Conservation in Beirut. Much of the budget for environmental protection and development has been sacrificed for relief work, he said. The oil spills, he said, will eventually be cleaned up and solid waste will be collected and disposed of when the war is over, but the forests are irreplaceable. ''In the end, who cares if a forest is on fire when there are people dying, others are being displaced and their houses or factories are on fire?'' he said. Water pollution has become an issue, too, said Karim el-Jisr, senior associate at Ecodit, a nongovernmental environmental association. Wastewater and freshwater canals are very close together and the many bombs that have hit roads and other infrastructure have damaged them. As a result, Mr. Jisr said, wastewater is contaminating the freshwater supply, especially in rural areas, causing further environmental degradation. But experts warn that the real environmental impact of the war will not be clear until the fighting ends. ''This war will affect the soil and the air,'' said Hala Ashour, the director of Green Line, the environmental group. ''But it's still too early to assess the actual damage because we have to analyze samples and that can't be done before the war is over.'' In Jiyeh, Mr. Saeed and the few other remaining residents have begun learning to live with the pollution. Within the first few days of the oil fire, Mr. Saeed said, they wore masks to breathe; now, he said, they are used to it. Maher Ali, 24, a fisherman, said: ''When the winds blow north, it's bearable, but when it blows east, it's deadly. The soot lands on the food and furniture and makes everything dirty. You just can't leave a glass of water sitting around. It's no wonder most families have given up and left.'' HOSTILITIES IN THE MIDEAST: ENVIRONMENT"
"MICHAEL SIVAK knows what it's like to regret buying a house. In his job as a risk assessor for the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program, he regularly deals with people who discover that they are living someplace where they probably should not be. ''People's homes are supposed to be their safe places,'' Mr. Sivak said. ''When we knock on their doors and say, 'We've identified a danger in your community,' their reactions are all over the map. They think, 'Could I possibly have put my family at risk?' '' ''A lot of people never even think of asking about the environmental conditions before they buy a house,'' he added. A chemist and toxicologist by training, and a communicator by temperament, Mr. Sivak was driven at a young age to try to sort out the broader human impact of the results he was seeing in the chemistry lab. ''I always wanted to know what the numbers meant,'' he said of the water and soil samples he analyzed as an undergraduate and graduate student. Seven years ago, when he was offered the job with a regional office of Superfund -- the E.P.A.'s program to identify, investigate and clean up some of the country's most toxic waste sites -- he sensed that it would satisfy this yearning. ''One thing I love about my job is that, in meeting the people who live on the Superfund sites, I'm motivated to keep cleaning them up,'' he said. But moving from Baltimore to New York City exposed him to a range of unforeseen hazards. For one thing, the city has its own fair share of toxic real estate, though the poison that contaminates the buildings is more often the product of human nastiness than industrial pollution. Fortunately, Mr. Sivak managed to avoid this problem. Shortly after arriving, he bought a 650-square foot co-op on President Street near Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. At a time when greed, suspicion and self-interest have destroyed the mood of many co-ops, Mr. Sivak finds himself living in one where people actually cooperate. ''We're not a commune, but there's a level of community here,'' Mr. Sivak said. His building has 20 apartments, all of them one-bedrooms inhabited primarily by single people in their 30's and 40's. ''Everyone says hello to everyone,'' he said. ''There's people whose doors I can knock on very spur of the moment. I'll invite people over to watch a movie.'' The neighborliness isn't just social, either. Residents contribute to the upkeep and management of the building, which helps hold down the monthly maintenance, now $495 per apartment. One owner set up a Yahoo community, and two others now maintain it. On it, residents can post notices (one neighbor needs a cat sitter, another a ride to the Salvation Army to drop off old clothes) and can find a complete archive of building history and meeting minutes. Another resident looks after the gardens front and back. Still others oversee boiler maintenance. And everyone pitched in a couple of years ago to buy a grill for the backyard. Another major hazard that trips up many newcomers to the city is having unrealistic expectations, especially when it comes to cost per square foot. They'll scoff at deals that, within a few weeks, they wished they'd embraced. Mr. Sivak caught on quickly. ''This is the smallest place I've ever lived,'' he said. But 650 square feet is plenty spacious when you've got just $150,000 to spend, a fact that wasn't lost on him. ''When I bought this place, there was nothing in Manhattan that I could afford,'' he said. ''I was 33 and didn't want to be living in a 300-square-foot apartment. It seemed odd that you could be sitting on your sofa watching television and then a few minutes later pull out your bed and go to sleep in the same place.'' And so he made peace with his square footage and began the process that so many people undertake when they realize that their homes can't be any bigger: they make their lives smaller. ''When I moved in I had so much stuff,'' Mr. Sivak said. ''I've gotten rid of tons of it. When I was packing up in Baltimore to come here, I discovered boxes that I'd never even opened. I just got rid of them. And it was fine.'' One thing he did hold on to is a pair of oversize chairs, which are now in his living room. They have a kind of Alice-in-Wonderland quality, as if they alone among his possessions forgot to sip from the ''Drink Me'' bottle. Even the neighborhood has proved to be a good choice for Mr. Sivak. ''Six years ago,'' he said, ''there were people who did not consider Fifth Avenue part of Park Slope. They thought of it as part of Gowanus.'' Today, the blocks around his building are lively with chic cafes, sociable delis and artsy boutiques. Anyone relocating to New York must also be prepared to steel himself against the waves of material longings induced by this city. Two years ago, Mr. Sivak was beset by a common urge: to redecorate. ''I wanted to redo some things in my apartment,'' he said, so on the advice of a friend who had worked at Crate & Barrel and loved it, Mr. Sivak took a temporary part-time job at its SoHo branch as a sales associate. ''If the job was great and I got an employee discount on furniture, all the better,'' he said. Acquiring a few attractive new pieces of bedroom furniture wasn't his only motivation. ''At the time,'' he said, ''I was dealing with some stressful sites at work. I wanted a different kind of interaction with people. During the day, I'd be talking to people about the effects of living in a Superfund site. In the evening, I was talking to customers about the difference between red-wine glasses and white-wine glasses. And if I didn't know the answer to a question, I could call someone over and figure it out right there on the spot.'' At the E.P.A., by contrast, questions often took months, or even years, to answer definitively -- if they had answers at all. Before Mr. Sivak could get around to picking out a new dresser and side table, however, he stumbled upon a better solution to his decorating problem. ''I got custom closets,'' he said. Away went the last vestiges of clutter from his bedroom; in their place appeared serenity in the form of floor space. And with that, Mr. Sivak's transformation was complete. ''I love Brooklyn,'' he said. ''I love the Slope.'' He even loves the facade of the building. ''It has character,'' he said. But most of all he loves his apartment. ''It's the best investment I ever made,'' he said. Habitats | Park Slope"
"With mounting evidence that exposure to the toxic smoke and ash at ground zero during the nine-month cleanup has made many people sick, attention is now focusing on the role of air-filtering masks, or respirators, that cost less than $50 and could have shielded workers from some of the toxins. More than 150,000 such masks were distributed and only 40,000 people worked on the pile, but most workers either did not have the masks or did not use them. These respirators are now at the center of a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 8,000 firefighters, police officers and private workers who say they were exposed to toxic substances at or near ground zero that have made them sick or may eventually do so. While residents and office workers in the area also suffered ill effects, the work crews at the site who had the greatest exposure are thought to have sustained the greatest harm. From legal documents presented in the case, a tale emerges of heroic but ineffective efforts to protect workers, with botched opportunities, confused policies and contradictions that failed to ensure their safety. Lawyers representing the workers say that there was no central distribution point for the respirators, no single organization responsible for giving them out, and no one with the power to make sure the respirators that were distributed got used, and used properly. By contrast, at the Pentagon, workers not wearing proper protective gear were escorted off the site. ''Employers are responsible for providing a safe workplace,'' said David Worby, the lawyer whose firm represents the workers. ''But the majority of workers at ground zero were given nothing, or had masks that didn't work.'' The allegations are based on the lawyers' review of more than 400,000 pages of official documents and the testimony of 30 government witnesses. The city, which is the principal government defendant, has moved to have the lawsuit dismissed. It argues that it and the private contractors it hired to help in the cleanup did their best to provide adequate equipment and to get workers to use it, but many workers ignored the warnings. Many workers cited reasons for not keeping the masks on, like the stifling heat and the difficulty of communicating while wearing them. Even if the response to an unprecedented emergency was flawed, the city's lawyers argue, a firmly established legal immunity under the State Defense Emergency Act and other laws protects New York from legal liability. Kenneth A. Becker, head of the city's World Trade Center litigation unit, declined to comment on the charges in the complaint, saying it was ''inappropriate to comment on pending litigation,'' beyond what is contained in documents already filed with the court. In those papers, the city argued that its ''concern for the health and safety of all workers and volunteers at the W.T.C. site began immediately after the September 11 attacks and continued until the end of the rescue, recovery and debris removal operations.'' Oral argument on the city's motion to dismiss the case is scheduled for June 22 before Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of United States District Court in Manhattan. Workplace Hazards Ground zero was about the most dangerous workplace imaginable: a smoking heap of nearly two million tons of tangled steel and concrete that contained a brew of toxins, including asbestos, benzene, PCB's, and more than 400 chemicals. Indeed, recent health studies have found that many people who worked on the pile have since developed a rash of serious ailments, including gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. In the chaos of the first 48 hours after the twin towers collapsed, only the city's firefighters had any personal protective equipment suitable for such an environment. But even that equipment was not sufficient. Each firefighter is issued a full-face mask that is part of a Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, also known as a Scott pack, which functions like scuba gear, supplying air while sealing out hazards. But the tanks contain no more than 18 minutes of oxygen. The system works well if a firefighter is dashing into a burning building to rescue a baby. For a nine-month recovery operation, it was useless. Once their Scott packs were exhausted, the first firefighters on the scene had no backup gear. That is why Firefighter Palmer Doyle and the crew from Engine Company 254 in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, stopped at a hardware store on the way into Manhattan on Sept. 11 to buy every paper dust mask in stock. When he returned to ground zero with 50 other firefighters on a bus a few days later, Firefighter Doyle looked for respirators. He was told there was just one left for the entire crew. It was given to the youngest among them. Firefighter Doyle, now 51 and retired with mild asthma, a recurring cough and other work-related problems, said that the firefighters never thought for a second of refusing to work without respirators, but they did wonder when they were going to be available. Records produced in the lawsuit indicate that the Fire Department put in an order with the city for 5,000 P100 Organic Vapor/Acid Gas half-face masks, which cost less than $50 each, and 10,000 replacement filter cartridges on Sept. 28. But the order was not processed for almost two months. Such delays remain a sore point. ''Firefighters worked during the 9/11 rescue operation with little or no respiratory protection, and anyone who claims differently is lying,'' said Stephen J. Cassidy, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association. ''The department further failed to supply anything but particle masks to its workers until much later.'' In the first few days after Sept. 11, the only types of breathing protection generally available to people at ground zero were surgical masks and paper dust masks, often distributed by volunteers. Even Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who has qualified for workers' compensation for Sept. 11-related ailments, wore paper masks at that time, although industrial safety officers say they were practically useless. When private construction crews first arrived to help with debris removal, they had no air-filtering equipment with them because they do not usually work in such hazardous conditions. ''For the average Joe, there was nothing,'' said Robert Gray, a crane operator who is co-author of a new book about the cleanup called ''Nine Months at Ground Zero'' (Scribner, 2006). Mr. Gray said that after several days, the International Union of Operating Engineers, to which he belongs, brought in a trailer to provide half-face masks and testing to make sure they fit and functioned properly. Outside the pile, most workers in the early days of the cleanup had only paper masks, and many of the laborers hired by cleaning contractors to vacuum the asbestos from buildings downtown had nothing at all. The New York Committee on Occupation Safety and Health, a union labor organization, provided checkups and respirators to more than 400 of these laborers, many of them illegal immigrants. David M. Newman, an industrial hygienist with the labor committee, said that when federal environmental officials announced that it was safe for people to return to Lower Manhattan so that Wall Street could reopen a week after the towers collapsed, employers suddenly ''had a green light to say, 'We don't need to use respirators because the E.P.A. says the air is OK.' '' He was referring to a statement made on Sept. 18, 2001, by Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, that air sampling done by her agency showed that the air was safe to breathe. The agency's inspector general concluded in 2003 that Ms. Whitman's statement was far too broad and could not be scientifically supported at the time she made it. According to the inspector general's exhaustive recounting of the environmental consequences of Sept. 11, a federal emergency response team prepared a report on the day of the attacks recommending that respirators be used at ground zero. But the report was never issued because it was decided that New York City, and not the federal government, should handle worker protection issues. As the magnitude of the recovery operation grew clearer, attempts were made to bring order to the operation. On Sept. 20 the city issued its first safety plan, and it asked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to take charge of distributing respirators. In what would become a controversial move, OSHA used its discretionary powers to decide not to enforce workplace safety regulations but to act in a supportive role that would not slow down operations. ''Given that the site was operating under emergency conditions, it was normal that we should suspend our enforcement action and assume the roles of consultation and technical assistance,'' Patricia Clark, OSHA regional administrator for New York, said in a 2003 OSHA publication. OSHA placed emergency orders for tens of thousands of P100 half-face masks with replaceable filters. They cost from $25 to $50 at the time, and were certified to be effective protection against asbestos and most of the dust on the site. But Mr. Worby, whose White Plains-based law firm, Worby Groner Edelman Napoli Bern, is handling the workers' joint action suit, said that even these masks were not adequate protection against the chemicals released by the collapsed buildings. He, and others, believe that ground zero should have been declared a toxic waste site, with workers required to wear hazardous-material suits. Records produced in the lawsuit indicate that the city did receive 75,000 Tyvek suits, white protective overalls often used at hazardous waste sites, but never distributed them at ground zero. Ms. Clark, the OSHA administrator, testified before Congress in October 2003 that the agency distributed 131,000 half-face respirators before the cleanup ended in June 2002, more than three times the number of workers on the site. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency provided 22,000 respirators and the operating engineers' union distributed 11,000. There has been no clear accounting of where they all went. But based on witness accounts and reports by safety officers at the site, it appears that most were used improperly and then discarded. OSHA's own regulations require that masks be tested for fit on each individual wearer, and that men with facial hair must shave for the masks to fit properly. The lawsuit against the city claims that most of the masks were simply handed out, without instructions or testing for fit. ''Respirator fit testing done around the World Trade Center was illusory at best,'' the lawsuit says. A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of downtown residents and schoolchildren exposed to ground zero contamination is pending in federal district court in Manhattan. Several health studies have shown that the closer people came to the debris pile in the early days and weeks after the twin towers collapsed, the more serious are the ailments they develop. A city registry of 71,000 people -- including responders and residents -- exposed to the dust showed that people who live downtown have developed respiratory and mental health problems. But they generally have not been as serious as those reported by people who worked directly on the pile. OSHA refused to answer questions about its handling of the respirators. John M. Chavez, a spokesman, said lawyers from the Department of Justice's environmental torts branch, which is handling trade center litigation, advised against talking to reporters about respirators because ''the question goes to the heart of the issue of the litigation.'' Going Without After the masks arrived at ground zero, it soon became apparent that distributing them was easier than getting workers to wear them. At that time of passion and heroism, putting on any kind of respirator or mask was an expression of concern about personal safety -- and for many that seemed selfish and unpatriotic in the midst of unimaginable disaster. By contrast, more than 90 percent of the workers at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, which was overseen by the Army Corps of Engineers, wore respirators. There were other reasons for not wearing the respirators. Scorching temperatures on the pile made working in the masks unbearable. It was nearly impossible for the workers to communicate with each other with masks on, so they pulled them down and many later kept them off. The filters clogged easily in the thick, powdery dust, and replacements were not always readily available. But perhaps the greatest impediments to compliance were the confusing guidelines and spotty enforcement efforts. Overseeing the work, and worker safety, was a horde of government entities that, at its peak, exceeded 30 city, state and federal agencies with overlapping jurisdictions and, at times, contradictory policies. Statements from the E.P.A. about the air being safe contradicted respirator requirements. OSHA eventually established a green line, which it actually painted around the pile, and ordered respirators to be worn inside the green line. But in November 2001 the various government agencies and private contractors entered into a partnership: OSHA agreed not to issue fines or citations, and the contractors vowed to follow regulations. The city, in its legal defense, says it issued advisories, distributed pamphlets and put up signs telling workers to wear respirators. But observers from unions and labor safety organizations, some using binoculars, found no more than half of the workers ever used their respirators. At times, no more than one in five workers were in compliance. The compliance problem at ground zero was regularly brought up at daily safety committee hearings held by the city with other agencies and private contractors. But without strict enforcement, the situation never improved. Frustrated contractors doubted that anything short of ''having workers' mother on site to admonish them to comply would be effective,'' according to records of one of the meetings cited in the legal documents. Mr. Worby, the lawyer, says attempts to blame the workers for not wearing respirators go against the spirit of New York labor laws, which oblige employers to provide safe working environments. He argued that even if doing so was impractical in the first chaotic days after the attacks, rigorous standards could have been imposed in the many months that followed. Lawyers for the injured workers are looking to recoup monetary damages for their pain, suffering, lost days and troubled nights. The city and the 190 private companies named in the lawsuit, which was filed last year, say they did the best they could to balance safety with expediency. They point out that in nine months at ground zero, there was not one fatality. But several recent health studies have shown that exposure to ground zero dust has caused serious respiratory and gastrointestinal problems in hundreds of people who worked at the site. Doctors have also started to notice an unusual number of lung-scarring diseases, especially among firefighters. So far there has been only one death officially linked to dust exposure, that of Detective James Zadroga, whose death early this year was attributed to lung scarring caused by the work he did at ground zero. Both sides in the suit cast an uneasy eye on the future. The city clearly worries that if there is another attack it will not be able to hire contractors and respond to the emergency without fear of becoming entangled in legal liabilities, which could hamper its ability to restore order and protect the city. In the samevein, the workers' representatives ask, if they are again called in to help, will the environmental and labor laws intended to protect them be enforced? Correction: June 7, 2006, Wednesday A front-page article on Monday about a lawsuit concerning the protective equipment used by workers at ground zero referred imprecisely to the contents of the breathing tanks that were supplied to firefighters. (The same error appeared in an accompanying illustration.) They contained compressed air, which includes oxygen; they did not contain oxygen alone. The illustration also mislabeled the central valve of the half-face air-filtering respirator. It was the exhalation, not inhalation, valve. A corrected version of the illustration is at nytimes.com/region."
"The Bush administration signed off on a weak rule governing mercury emissions from power plants this week, only days after Gov. George Pataki of New York proposed a strong rule. This should come as no surprise. Over the last few years, the states have done a better job of cleaning the air and protecting public health than the federal government has, in part because they have been more aggressive in using regulatory leverage to force industry to develop cleaner ways of doing business. The mercury issue is a case in point. Mercury is a toxin that has been found in increasingly high concentrations in fish in lakes and streams. The country's 1,100 coal-fired power plants produce 48 tons of it a year, a little over 40 percent of the total produced in the United States. The Bush rule, drafted in part by the electric utilities it seeks to regulate, aims at a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2010 and a 70 percent reduction by 2018. The rule relies on a market-based trading system that would let utilities reduce emissions or buy credits from other companies, allowing them to defer investments in their own plants. Emissions trading has worked well with other airborne pollutants, but in this case it is inappropriate because mercury, which tends to settle quickly, presents a special danger to residents near the source. The Clean Air Act plainly requires state-of-the-art controls at each plant for toxic substances like mercury, which means that the Bush rule may also be illegal. It is already the subject of a lawsuit. Mr. Pataki's plan, by contrast, would require in-state plants to install the latest pollution-control technology with a goal of cutting mercury emissions by 50 percent by 2010 and by 90 percent by 2015. The big power companies managed to convince the Bush administration that targets like these would be ruinously expensive, but Mr. Pataki estimates that at worst they will add less than a dollar a month to the average residential electricity bill. If successful on this score, Mr. Pataki will end his term with a solid record of achievement on clean air issues that should shame his Republican friends in Washington. He has imposed new limits on emissions of nitrogen oxide, which helps create smog, and sulfur dioxide, a contributor to acid rain. He has joined six other Northeastern states in a regional effort to reduce greenhouse gases, and he has joined California's effort to force a big reduction in those same gases from automobiles. What distinguishes Mr. Pataki and other like-minded governors from the Bush administration -- nearly a dozen other states have imposed or are considering tougher mercury controls -- is their willingness to challenge industry to challenge itself. Mr. Bush has been talking a good game recently about how technology is going to help us on global warming and on producing alternative fuels, but history shows that industry usually needs powerful incentives to make things happen.

"Seeking to make rail shipments of chlorine and other hazardous chemicals less vulnerable to attack, the Homeland Security Department intends to announce a proposed rule on Friday to require railroads to track continuously tanker cars for ''toxic inhalation hazards'' and bar them from leaving the cars unattended or parked for long periods. The proposal would also clarify how government workers inspect tank cars and railyards for compliance, establish rules on the chain of custody and handoff of dangerous cargoes and set communications requirements. Each year, the railroads carry 1.7 million shipments of hazardous materials, of which 100,000 are toxic chemicals prone to becoming airborne in an accident. About 80 percent of the shipments that can become poison gases are chlorine, for purifying water and other applications, or anhydrous ammonia, for fertilizer. An official of the Homeland Security Department provided details of the plan on the condition that he not be identified further, because it has not been published. The plan is to be open for public comment for 60 days. Among other changes, each railroad would have to have a round-the-clock security coordinator to receive tips on threats to cargoes and immediately inform the government of details like the location of cargo. Many high-hazard cargoes move through densely populated areas, and some cities would like to ban them. The District of Columbia adopted an ordinance in February 2005 that requires permits for ''ultra-hazardous materials,'' including explosives, flammable liquids like liquefied petroleum gas, toxic solids and toxic gases, from an area extending 2.2 miles from the Capitol. CSX, which operates a stretch of tracks between the Federal buildings just south of the Mall, challenged the ordinance in court as unduly burdensome to interstate commerce. Enforcement has been blocked while the case works its way through the federal courts. Fred Millar, a consultant to the City Council who drafted the ordinance, said eight cities were weighing similar rules: Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia and St. Louis. The new rule would not address routes. Such rules would be sensible, Mr. Millar said, but railroads did not like them because they might be forced to give business to one another. Officials say that the Transportation Department is considering rules on routes that could be published soon. The domestic security proposal is that carriers would have to establish security zones around affected rail cars parked, loaded or unloaded in urban areas. More than five years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, few federal rules specifically try to prevent terrorists from attacking materials on the rails. Train crews carry manifests showing what they carry and where, and there are coded placards on tank cars that identify the contents to emergency responders and anybody else with a readily available emergency response handbook."
"Utah officials hope that the state's image can be best defined by its vast public lands and unspoiled forests, lakes and mountains. But some here fear that a recent change in the name of the city's professional basketball arena may create for Utah new and far less savory associations with corruption and nuclear waste. Since the arena's opening in 1991 as the home of the Utah Jazz, it was called the Delta Center, for Delta Air Lines, which struck the original deal for naming rights with Larry H. Miller, the team's owner. But in November, a hazardous waste services company based here, EnergySolutions, outbid bankrupt Delta to win a 10-year naming-rights contract. The winning bid, the price of which neither side would disclose, has created the EnergySolutions Arena. Steve Creamer, the company's president, is looking to overcome the negative publicity that the company, known until 10 months ago as Envirocare of Utah, has received over its operation of a large nuclear waste facility in the Utah desert. EnergySolutions was formed in February by the merger of three companies, including Envirocare, which set up the nuclear waste facility on public land in 1988 with the approval of Larry F. Anderson, then director of the Utah Division of Radiation Control. Mr. Anderson was later convicted on federal bribery charges of taking cash and a condominium in the resort town of Park City from Envirocare's founder and former owner, Khosrow B. Semnani. Mr. Semnani pleaded guilty to a charge of tax evasion. The state has granted EnergySolutions a license to double the size of the low-level nuclear waste site, to about two square miles, though the approval is not final, in part because the Legislature and the governor also must have a say. But an antinuclear group, the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah, or Heal Utah, has sued the state to revoke the license, and that is also delaying the expansion. The alliance also opposes the company's plan to expand the nuclear waste facility to a height of about eight stories. On her way into a recent Jazz game, Leslie Birkett, a 42-year-old advertising executive from Kearns, said she had heard the nicknames for the arena: HazzMat Center, Half-Life Arena, Radium Stadium, the Tox Box. ''Utah already has enough strikes against it,'' Ms. Birkett said. ''This is the last thing we need.'' More disgusted was Tom Kessler, 66, a hard-core fan wearing a leather Jazz jacket. ''Utah's always been the 'stick-it' state; whatever you don't want in your state, stick it here,'' said Mr. Kessler, an executive with a medical device company. ''We're not tree huggers, but these guys lend credence to bringing all this stuff to Utah. It's bogus.'' But another Jazz fan, Weston Anderson, 21, of West Valley City, felt differently. He first learned about the company when he passed people carrying signs at a pregame protest sponsored by Heal Utah, Mr. Anderson said. The arena's new name does not roll off the tongue, he said, ''but I don't have a problem with that line of business because I believe in the free market.'' The alliance has called on Mr. Miller to rescind the naming-rights deal, and on consumers to boycott his other businesses, which include car dealerships, movie theaters, a television station and an auto racetrack. Mr. Miller issued a statement saying he was proud of his association with EnergySolutions. Mr. Creamer has said his company is vital to Utah's future, has brought dozens of talented scientists and engineers to the state, and hopes to become a worldwide business for transporting, processing, storing and disposing of radioactive materials. The company recently won a federal grant to study sites that might be used for reprocessing nuclear fuel, a recycling process in which plutonium is extracted from spent fuel and mixed with uranium to make new fuel. But this year, the company had a setback with the Utah government. Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. vetoed legislation that would have made it easier for the state to approve proposals for new or expanded nuclear waste sites. In a letter to state legislators, Mr. Huntsman said the bill would have weakened the governor's authority ''to protect Utah's image and environment.'' His administration has invested in strengthening Utah's image as a welcoming place for tourists, especially those attracted to outdoor activities in the state's mountains and forests. Part of that push has been a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign, ''Utah: Life Elevated,'' featuring the state's landmarks and landscapes. EnergySolutions also has embarked on a media campaign, emphasizing the company's environmental cleanups nationwide and the safety of its operations. Kedrick Black, a 26-year-old electrical engineer and Jazz fan, said he learned about the company from its advertisements. ''It's a good company,'' Mr. Black said. ''Yes, they handle nuclear waste, but they're making it safer.'' Vanessa Pierce, executive director of Heal Utah, does not see it quite that way. EnergySolutions' advertisements ''make it look like they're curing cancer and building golf courses'' and solving global warming, Ms. Pierce said. She accused the company of trying to mislead the public by promoting a wholesome image to gain support for the waste site expansion. At the protest outside the arena, Louis Borgenicht, 64, a Salt Lake City pediatrician, told those gathered that EnergySolutions officials ''are part of the problem, not, as they claim, part of the solution.''"
"Ancient Amber A piece of amber that is, say, 25 million years old and contains a midge or a spider is one thing, but the amber being reported in the current issue of Nature is something else entirely. Described by Alexander R. Schmidt of the Natural History Museum at Humboldt University-Berlin and colleagues, the droplets of amber are 220 million years old. Rather than containing an insect or two, they contain bacteria, fungi, algae and protozoans -- a who's who of micro-organisms from the Triassic. Several thousand droplets, each less than one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, were found in a paleosol, an ancient soil layer preserved under sediments, in the Dolomites in northern Italy. (Amber older than 135 million years is very rare, and none that old has been found to have inclusions containing microbes.) The source of the amber, the researchers say, is probably conifers that would have existed in the area when it was the northern coast of an ancient body of water called the Tethys Sea. Drops of resin would have solidified on the plants, encasing the micro-organisms, and then fallen into the soil. The researchers say the micro-organisms found all resemble species that exist today, and can be assigned to existing genera. That means the lowest levels of the land-based food webs have changed little since the earliest days of the dinosaurs. These kinds of tiny organisms have survived for hundreds of millions of years even when many larger ones (including, of course, the dinosaurs themselves) did not. Removing Lead Paint, Safely If you've ever tried to remove old paint from a door or molding, you know how difficult the job can be. If the paint contains lead (as many household paints did before 1978, when a ban went into effect), then a difficult task can become a potentially hazardous one. Ingested lead can lead to severe health problems, particularly in children. Some paint removal methods -- dry sanding, in particular -- can make the problem worse, by increasing the amount of lead dust in the air. But all methods, including wet sanding and chemical or heat stripping, have drawbacks. A promising new method that uses light has been tested by its developer, Phoenix Science and Technology of Chelmsford, Mass. Michael J. Grapperhaus and Raymond B. Schaefer of the company report in the journal Environmental Science and Technology that the system effectively removed paint without putting a lot of lead into the air. The system uses a surface discharge lamp, a type that creates extremely short, high-intensity pulses. Equipped with an elliptical reflector to focus the light, the lamp can vaporize layers of paint without heating up or burning the wood underneath. Once the paint is vaporized, a brush and vacuum unit sucks the fumes away and through a filter, which removes the lead. Levels of lead remaining on the wood and in the air were below regulatory guidelines. The researchers say that these initial tests demonstrated that the concept works, but that more development and testing is needed. Asteroid Watch The Planetary Society has announced a competition to design a mission to the asteroid Apophis with the goal of putting a transponder or other device on it to determine whether it will hit Earth. The competition has a $50,000 prize. Apophis, which is roughly a quarter-mile in diameter, will make a close approach to Earth in 2029. There is a very small chance that it could pass through a ''keyhole'' in space at that time that would cause it to hit Earth seven years later. But not enough is known about its orbit to rule such an event in or out. NASA thinks ground-based observations by 2013 will provide the necessary information about Apophis's orbit (and if the news is bad, presumably that would leave enough time for a mission to deflect the asteroid). But others are not so sure, and there have been discussions about a mission to ''tag'' the asteroid so its orbit could be precisely measured by radar or other means. The competition is an effort to come up with creative ideas for how to do such a mission. Birdsongs of the City Life is tough in the big city. Sure, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, but the truth is that not everyone can. That's true of birds as well as people. Research has shown that urban environments have a way of reducing the variety of birds, such that the same few species are found in every city (pigeons, anyone?). Why do only some species thrive in cities? A study by Hans Slabbekoorn and Ardie den Boer-Visser of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands suggests one answer, for songbirds at least: successful ones can make themselves heard above the noise. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, looked at a small songbird, the great tit (Parus major), which is found across Europe, in both city and country. The researchers recorded songs of birds in the centers of Paris, London, Berlin and seven other cities and compared them with songs of birds from nearby forested areas. They found that the minimum pitch of urban birds' songs was always higher than those of forest birds. And urban birds' songs were shorter and faster. (Hear them at nytimes.com/science.) Like other songbirds, the male great tit uses its songs both to mark territory and attract mates. But unlike some songbirds, the great tit is also able to change its songs and learn new ones, even as an adult. With all the low-frequency traffic noise in cities, Dr. Slabbekoorn said, ''the lowest parts of bird song will be the first to be masked.'' So a bird that shifts to a higher pitch will be better able to be heard and thus be more successful in finding mates. As for why the urban birds' songs are shorter and faster, Dr. Slabbekoorn said that this probably has to do with the urban environment as well. Compared with forests, cities are very open, with turbulent air that can degrade sound quality. In such an environment, repetition is important, and a shorter song can be repeated more often. And a shorter individual note -- particularly the first one, which birds use as a kind of ''alert'' to other birds -- has less chance of being affected than a longer one. It's not that the city birds are necessarily evolving to sing different songs, Dr. Slabbekoorn said. What has evolved is the great tit's ability to adapt its songs -- and that process began long before cities existed. ''They've evolved capabilities in the forest that have made them successful in the cities,'' he said. Observatory"
"JARED SELTZER faced more than the usual megabyte headaches recently while shopping for a desktop computer for his office in Takoma Park, Md. As the information technology director of the Center for a New American Dream, a small environmental group, he wanted to buy a computer that would be relatively easy on the ecosystem. His search brought him to the Dell Web site, where he chose an OptiPlex model that had been refurbished. ''I wasn't losing anything by not buying new,'' Mr. Seltzer said. ''And it was good that I was being true to what we're about.'' Refurbished computers, he explained, are not generally made from old clunkers on their last legs. They are typically returned by buyers shortly after delivery and spruced up by the manufacturer. And they often have the same guarantees that new computers do. Like many other consumers, Mr. Seltzer is concerned about the environmental effects of computers, which can contain hazardous substances including lead, cadmium and mercury, among others. Hazards occur when these substances are extracted from the earth and, on the other end, when they are disposed of. At either end, toxic substances can find their way into the air, soil, water and eventually into people, where they have the potential to cause serious health problems. Refurbished computers lessen the blow to the environment because they have effectively been recycled, albeit at warp speed. They can also be easier on the bank account. Mr. Seltzer's desktop cost him $379 -- less than half the $800 price of a new one. Lynn Rubinstein, executive director of the Northeast Recycling Council in Brattleboro, Vt., faced a similar challenge when she needed to replace her personal laptop in October. She could not find a refurbished model to fit her needs, so she consulted the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, or Epeat, an electronics rating system available free at www.epeat.net. The system, now five months old, is funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and is meant primarily for bulk buyers. But it is useful for individuals, too. Electronics -- only computers now, with more products to follow -- can be achieve ratings of gold, silver or bronze. Ratings are done largely on the honor system, subject to reviews by the Green Electronics Council, a nonprofit group in Portland, Ore., that maintains the list. Manufacturers score their products against a set of environmental standards, including levels of hazardous substances, energy efficiency and ease of recycling. There are 23 requirements just to win a bronze. More than 300 types of desktops, laptops and monitors have received at least a bronze, and most also have a silver rating, which means that they also meet at least half of 28 optional standards. None of the computers have it to gold, which means that they would meet all the required standards as well as three-quarters of the optional ones. An NEC monitor made from a corn-based plastic has the top score: 42, just two points shy of the gold standard. Dell, Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo all have at least one desktop and laptop that qualify for silver. Epeat-rated computers are likely to save buyers money on their electric bills. The E.P.A. estimates that 600,000 megawatts of energy, as well as 13 million pounds of hazardous waste, will be saved over the next five years by the purchase of Epeat-rated computers. ''It was enough for me just to get one that made the list at any level,'' said Ms. Rubinstein, who chose a Dell Latitude computer that had a bronze rating. She paid the same price as she would have for a comparable laptop without an Epeat rating, but the Latitude was listed as having significantly lower levels of hazardous substances. Consumers seeking new environmentally sound computers may also want to consider keeping their existing ones just a while longer, said Diganta Das, a research scientist at the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park. There will be a much broader selection of greener computers and other electronics by 2008 because all manufacturers are under pressure to make their products meet hazardous-substance standards that are as high or higher than those of Epeat, he said. The push is coming from new technology and government initiatives. The most important political change came in July, when the European Union issued its Restrictions on Hazardous Substances. The RoHS directive essentially will require all manufacturers and retailers selling their products in the European Union to greatly reduce the presence of six hazards. There is nothing like those standards in the United States, but the directive is nonetheless having an impact here. Wal-Mart Stores, for example, said last spring that it would sell the first laptop compliant with the European standards in the United States: a $700 Toshiba model. Other computer makers are quickly following suit. CONCERNS about the environment don't end once a computer has been bought. Consumers also need to consider what to do with their computers when it comes time to retire them. According to the National Safety Council, three-quarters of all existing computers are sitting in closets and other places where they are no longer being used. Besides the closet option, there are two other main solutions: disposal and recycling. Disposal, however, is the hardest on the environment. In May, New Hampshire became the fourth state -- after California, Massachusetts and Maine -- to ban the disposal of all video display devices from landfills and incinerators. Two months later, Minnesota passed a law prohibiting the disposal of monitors in the trash. As for the recycling option, many localities offer programs. But the best recycling route may be the one back to the source: Many manufacturers now take back old computers free, and some of their parts can be reused. SUNDAY MONEY: SPENDING"
"Vieques, a small island off the coast of Puerto Rico, made headlines a few years back when environmental activists engaged in civil disobedience aimed at forcing the Navy to stop using it for bombing practice. The Navy bowed to the pressure and departed in May 2003, leaving behind 60 years worth of bomb fragments and an untold amount of unexploded ordnance. It also left behind an obligation to clean the place up, an obligation made more urgent by the possibility of a link between the damage on the ground -- the pollution of the soil and the local water supply -- and a variety of physical ailments that have been detected among residents. Neither the Navy nor the Environmental Protection Agency is prepared to say for sure that this link exists. The desperate poverty in which Vieques residents live may be at least partly responsible for the high disease rates, and no study by federal authorities has established a clear connection between the contaminants and various illnesses. But studies by the Puerto Rican Health Department and universities show the need for further investigation. Cancer rates among Vieques's 9,300 inhabitants run 27 percent higher than the rates in other parts of Puerto Rico. There also are unusually high levels of heavy metals in the plant, animal and human populations, as well as high levels of childhood asthma and mercury contamination. There needs to be a more precise picture of what contaminants exist on the bombing range, and what their levels are. But such measurements have been hard to come by because the range is covered with thick jungle growth that must first be cleared -- a task complicated by unexploded ordnance. Nevertheless, the job has to be done and the necessary tests conducted, the sooner the better. And the ultimate responsibility for this falls to the Navy. Vieques is a Superfund site, and under Superfund law, the responsible party is obliged to do the cleanup and to pay for it. But there have been charges of foot-dragging that the Navy has not convincingly answered. There is also some question about whether the Navy is using the most effective methods, or just the cheapest ones. Without a thorough cleanup, the economic redevelopment of Vieques cannot proceed, and there will always be the fear -- if not the reality itself -- of a link between contamination and disease. And without the Navy's help in meeting the island's special health care needs, there will always be a debt to the people of Vieques. Editorial"
"ONE New York City firefighter recently told me about the health problems he has suffered since working at the World Trade Center site nearly five years ago: skin rashes, an inflamed colon, coughing and trouble breathing. He showed me a six-page list of the antibiotics and steroids doctors had prescribed over the years. These drugs helped mask his symptoms. But the problems never went away -- until he began a new treatment to rid his body of the toxic substances he had inhaled and absorbed at Ground Zero. This firefighter is among an estimated 40,000 police, firefighters and other workers who did rescue and cleanup on ''the pile'' after Sept. 11, 2001, while the remains of the buildings -- not to mention their contents, jet fuel and other debris -- smoldered for weeks, poisoning the air with mercury, lead, dioxin, asbestos, copper and dozens of other substances. Today, increasing numbers of emergency service workers are reporting breathing and digestive problems and rashes, and their incidence of cancer is higher than normal. At least one death, that of Detective James Zadroga in January, from heart and lung complications, has been linked by a medical examiner to work at Ground Zero; six other responders in their 30's and 40's have died from causes like heart failure and lung cancer. On Monday, Gov. George E. Pataki signed a law ordering New York City to pay more generous death benefits to the families of Sept. 11 responders who die from these illnesses. This measure, like the one passed last year granting disability pensions to Sept. 11 workers who develop respiratory problems or cancers, properly acknowledges the government's responsibility for their health. Still needed, however, even more urgently, is an effort to address the health problems these workers face. Many of the thousands of sufferers, like the firefighter who spoke to me, are getting treatments that offer only temporary relief. We need to figure out the best ways of curing what really ails the Sept. 11 responders. Too often, discussions about the health of these workers have met with official denials that their problems can be directly linked to Ground Zero. The denial began only a week after the tragedy, when Christine Todd Whitman, then head of the Environmental Protection Agency, declared that tests showed the air was safe to breathe. Later scientific studies showed that the air was in fact heavily polluted. And while it is true that the workers' health problems have not been definitively linked to the environment, a wealth of evidence suggests that the air the workers breathed took its toll. A study of more than 12,000 firemen and emergency medical workers at the site, recently published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, found that on average they had a reduction in lung function equivalent to what would be caused by 12 years of aging. Doctors and other health practitioners at the Olive Leaf Wholeness Center, in downtown New York (where I work as a volunteer), have detected heavy-metal poisoning in many of the Ground Zero workers they have seen. They have given these workers detoxification treatments -- including chelation for many patients. Chelation, a treatment often used on children exposed to lead paint, involves giving the patient a sulfur compound that draws heavy metals from the tissues. These practitioners have found that after three to four months of detoxification therapy, the afflicted Ground Zero workers see most of their symptoms diminish or disappear. Chelation is not the only detoxification method. No doubt, other doctors may have found treatments that work better on certain patients. The federal government has provided New York City with $1 billion to cover the cost of liability claims brought by Ground Zero workers. Some of these funds have paid the legal costs of fighting disability and other claims filed by city workers. But no money has yet been appropriated for treatment of heavy metal toxicity. There seems to be an assumption that the workers would prefer a large financial settlement to regaining their health. Political leaders should bring together medical experts who could determine the most effective protocols for ridding the body of heavy metals and make them known to Ground Zero workers and their doctors.

"Five days a week for two years, parents in this rural township in southern New Jersey would drop off their children, some as young as 8 months old, at Kiddie Kollege, a day care center where these days wilted pansies go unattended outside the locked front door. But what the parents did not know was that the unattractive one-story building, about 30 miles south of Philadelphia, was the site of a former mercury thermometer factory and that their children, who spent up to 10 hours a day there, were being exposed to what the State Department of Environmental Protection described last month as unacceptably high levels of mercury. A third of the 60 children tested have shown abnormally high levels of mercury in their systems. And while experts have said the levels of mercury found in urine specimens are not high enough to indicate health problems, they are high enough to require long-term monitoring, and the ultimate health implications for the children may not be known for years. But what is clear, and what is now the subject of an investigation by the state attorney general, is that the responsibility for cleaning up and regulating the building slipped like quicksilver through the fingers of state agencies, local officials and the building's owner, who in February 2004 allowed Kiddie Kollege to open. ''I've had a lot of sleepless nights, and my wife cries on a daily basis,'' said Sean McCleery, whose two children, Autumn, 6, and Tristan, 3, tested above normal and must continue to be monitored. ''You think you're doing the best you can to protect your children, and it ends up in a heartbreaking situation.'' So while health experts are minimizing the long-term effects of the contamination, that is little comfort to parents and the owner of Kiddie Kollege, who closed the center on July 28, the day the state determined that the building was not fit for occupancy. For now, the state attorney general's office is investigating who was responsible for allowing a building to open despite mercury vapor levels at least 27 times the regulatory limit. Mercury, a naturally occurring element, is toxic if inhaled or ingested. Symptoms of mercury poisoning in children include insomnia, irritability, rashes and peeling of hands and skin. Mercury vapors are heavier than air and therefore more prevalent near the floor, where children nap and play. A timeline released by the state's Department of Environmental Protection describes how a series of missed opportunities and incomplete communications over the past 12 years put children at risk. Christopher M. Manganello, a lawyer in Pitman, N.J., who is representing more than a dozen families, said: ''As a pilot, you need a chain of errors, not just one error, to cause a crash. If any one error had not been made, this whole tragedy would not have occurred. The ball got dropped.'' The first missed step came on Jan. 1, 1994, when Accutherm Inc. of Williamsburg, Va., which made thermometers in the one-story building here, closed after 10 years in business. Under state environmental law, a company is required to clean up any spills or toxic materials left behind, even if it files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as the company did in March 1994. But Accutherm did not comply with the department's directive to clean all the discharges of mercury and other toxic material at the site. Bill Wolfe, the head of an environmental watchdog group and a former policy adviser at the environmental agency, said the state should have put a lien on the property and erected signs and fences around it to notify neighbors about the possible hazards. The New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act allows for the department to clean up hazards left behind, then to charge the polluter three times the cost. ''That's where the breakdown initially occurred,'' Mr. Wolfe said. ''Had that been addressed appropriately by D.E.P., all the other stuff would not have occurred.'' Lisa P. Jackson, the commissioner of the environmental department, conceded in an interview this week that the agency needed better tracking of contaminated sites, clearer cleanup priorities and stronger enforcement efforts. ''This is an example when all three of those kind of collide in a bad way,'' she said. ''It crystallizes some of the things we need to do differently.'' But she said other people involved in the case needed to do similar soul-searching. ''I won't run from the fact that D.E.P. played a role in this, but lots of other people did too,'' she said. ''And lots of people are running to point fingers who need to be looked at really closely.'' The building remained vacant until 2001, when a local realtor, Jim Sullivan Jr., bought it for back taxes and began renovations. Mr. Sullivan's lawyer, Richard M. Hluchan, said his client knew that the building had once housed a thermometer factory, but thought it could be developed because a 1996 report issued by the federal Environmental Protection Agency said the site did not belong on the Superfund list and was not eligible for a federal cleanup because it ''does not present an immediate threat to human health or the environment.'' In fact, only the state can issue a letter saying that cleanup standards have been met. The federal determination simply meant that hazards from the site were not reaching other properties. But Mr. Hluchan said Mr. Sullivan also felt reassured because the state environmental department never responded to a letter from Mr. Sullivan's son addressed ''To Whom it May Concern'' requesting information about any problems at the site. Then in September 2003, a township construction official told the state environmental department that the owner wanted to convert the site to a day care center. ''N.J.D.E.P. informed the construction official that it was not recommended to convert the site at that time,'' according to the department's timeline, because it had not been certified as cleaned and ready for development. But the mayor of Franklin Township, Dave Ferrucci, said his staff had no memory of any such phone conversation, and had erroneously relied on the federal report. In October 2003, Mr. Hluchan said, Mr. Sullivan was considering selling the property and again asked the state environmental department for public records about the site. But he said Mr. Sullivan received only the 1996 report, which did not accurately reflect the problems at the site. Mr. Sullivan decided not to sell the property, and after the township granted permits for renovations, a zoning permit and a certificate of occupancy, he leased the building to Kiddie Kollege, which opened in 2004. ''We weren't told anything, we had no idea,'' said Linda Turner, who was a receptionist at the day care center and whose pregnant daughter, Becky Baughman, owns the business. ''I would not have even started to work there and I'm sure she wouldn't put her child in there,'' Ms. Turner said. Then, in 2005, the property was removed from the state environmental agency's booklet of known contaminated sites along with about 1,800 other sites that were considered low priority because, as Commissioner Jackson said, it was believed to be empty. Still, as for allowing a day care center on the site, she said, ''The one decision that made this into a screaming emergency is not one we made.'' On April 11 this year, while inspecting low-priority sites, the department discovered that the child care center was operating in the building. Two weeks later, the state environmental department said it contacted Mr. Sullivan to see if the site had been decontaminated, and according to the timeline, he said the state had indicated there were no problems there. But he was again referring to the 1996 federal report. On July 28, tests that the state environmental department required showed elevated levels of mercury vapor, and droplets of mercury were later found in the basement and between the floor joists. Some have questioned why the state did not close the day care center as soon as the environmental agency discovered that mercury was present, since officials knew that there was no letter certifying it clean and ready for development. But Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the department, said that at that time it did not have test results to confirm that the building was unsafe. ''In hindsight, in April, we could have shut it down regardless of home rule, regardless of anything,'' Ms. Makatura said. Despite her department's failure to provide complete information about hazards at the property, Ms. Jackson criticized local officials for missing her agency's warning against allowing the day care site, and spoke harshly of Mr. Sullivan. ''For the owner to have hired an attorney and basically say at this point, 'Well, I sent an undated letter with no address and I figured it was clean and consider that a level of diligence,' I don't know how he sleeps at night,'' she said. The state's Division of Youth and Family Services, which licenses day care centers, has also been criticized for not discovering the site on the environmental department's public list of contaminated areas. But Kate Bernyk, a spokeswoman, said the division was not required to check that list, and is required to ensure only that day care centers are free of lead, asbestos and radon gas, not mercury. ''We are already working with the Department of Environmental Protection on how the two departments, along with other state and local officials, can best share information to strengthen that safety net,'' she said. Gov. Jon S. Corzine has formed a team of cabinet members from the Departments of Health, Community Affairs, Labor, Environment, and Children and Families, to discuss ways to prevent similar chains of errors from endangering the public. Robert Jenkins, 44, a diesel mechanic who lives across the highway from the center, had considered sending his children there, but he said that in the end he did not want them crossing the busy street. ''I fault the state and the township too,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''The bad thing about it is children are going to suffer. In the township, everybody starts finger-pointing, but the children are going to suffer.''"
"Carbon monoxide poisoning apparently killed an elderly couple whose bodies were found in their home on Saturday, the Nassau County police said yesterday. Morton Licht, 85, who had been in the real estate business, and his wife, Muriel, 83, were found by police officers searching the house at a neighbor's request. A preliminary autopsy found high levels of carbon monoxide in their blood. The police said they believed that the source was an automobile in the garage whose engine had been left running.

"Unions representing thousands of staff scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency say the agency is bending to political pressure and ignoring sound science in allowing a group of toxic chemicals to be used in agricultural pesticides. Leaders of several federal employee unions say the chemicals pose serious risks for fetuses, pregnant women, young children and the elderly through food and exposure and should not be approved by Thursday, the Congressional deadline for completing an agency review of thousands of substances in pesticides. ''We are concerned that the agency has not, consistent with its principles of scientific integrity and sound science, adequately summarized or drawn conclusions'' about the chemicals, union leaders told the agency administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, in a newly disclosed letter sent May 25. The leaders also wrote that they believed that under priorities of E.P.A. management, ''the concerns of agriculture and the pesticide industry come before our responsibility to protect the health of our nation's citizens.'' Nine union leaders representing 9,000 agency scientists and other personnel around the country signed the letter. It was given to The New York Times on Tuesday by environmental advocacy organizations working on their behalf in the hope that it would arouse public outcry and increase pressure on the agency to withdraw the chemicals from use. The chemicals at issue are organophosphates and carbamates, long a matter of controversy over their environmental and health risks. They are in such pesticides as chlorpyrifos, methyl parathion and diazinon. The advocacy organizations that released the letter, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and the Pesticide Action Network, also provided the agency's response, on June 27, from Susan B. Hazen, acting assistant administrator. Ms. Hazen assured the scientists that her agency was applying proper scientific review for the use of all chemicals in pesticides. Ms. Hazen did not deny the accusation that industry positions were taken into account. She welcomed information ''from all interested parties,'' she said. In an interview on Tuesday, Jim Jones, director of the E.P.A.'s pesticide office, described the scientists' accusations as inaccurate, saying the agency examines the effects of various chemicals and adjusts recommendations for public use according to what the science dictates. Risk assessments of the pesticides cited in the unions' letter, Mr. Jones said, have been ''aggressively regulated'' through steady reviews of their use over the last six years. The complaints from agency employees are the latest to come from within federal agencies that accuse the Bush administration of allowing politics or industry pressure to trump science on issues like climate change and stem cell research. In this case, they also echo concerns raised by the E.P.A. inspector general in January in a report that suggested the agency had not done enough to protect children from exposure to pesticides, which can affect the development of the brain and the nervous system. That investigation was prompted, in part, by published reports of a Florida program in which parents would be paid for letting their children participate in an effort measuring the effects of pesticides in the home. The program was quickly shut down. The inspector general's report fueled a growing desire among union leaders to take a more active role in shedding light on what they say is a flawed system. ''More and more, the unions are coming together to confront the agency's unwillingness to make the appropriate use of science to show risks to public health and the environment,'' said William Hirzy, a senior scientist at the environmental agency and a union official. Despite the agency's insistence that pesticide regulations follow scientific guidelines, several agency scientists said industry determined how chemicals were regulated. ''It's how the game is played,'' said an E.P.A. specialist involved in the pesticide program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because, he said, critics within the agency often lose choice assignments. ''You go to a meeting, and word comes down that this is an important chemical, this is one we've got to save,'' he said. ''It's all informal, of course. But it suggests that industry interests are governing the decisions of E.P.A. management. The pesticide program functions as a governmental cover for what is effectively a private industry licensing program.'' Another senior E.P.A. scientist who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the agency often ignored independent scientific studies that contradicted the industry-subsidized study that supported many regulations on pesticides. She cited a North Carolina researcher who found that chlorpyrifos might have a more damaging effect on developing brains than other studies. ''What we heard back from headquarters was, 'No, he's wrong,' '' the scientist said. ''Chemicals like these can be harmful to children in ways we don't understand yet,'' the scientist said. ''If there is disagreement, doesn't that cry out for further research?'' Mr. Jones said the agency had addressed chlorpyrifos in complying with a 10-year Congressional mandate to review 9,741 pesticide ingredients by Thursday. Work has been completed on 9,637 of them, or 99 percent, he said, and ''all are protective of children.''"
"The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that a new program paid for by industry groups would help capture up to seven tons of mercury emissions a year from old and out-of-use vehicles. The mercury is primarily found in light switches in cars and trucks built before 2003. Until now, it has been ignored as old vehicles are dismantled, shredded, melted or crushed. Agency officials estimated that 67.5 million switches were in use and available for recovery from vehicles on the road. The program evolved from two years of negotiations between the agency, automakers, metal scrappers, vehicle shredders and environmental groups, including the Environmental Defense and the Ecology Center. That made the effort a relatively rare collaboration between industry and advocacy groups. ''This is a big step in erasing this source of mercury pollution,'' Steven L. Johnson, the agency administrator, said in an interview. ''To see all these groups agree on an issue is a great example of opposing sides of the table coming together to solve an environmental problem.'' Mercury is one of the most toxic air pollutants, and vehicle parts have been the fourth biggest source of it, after coal-fired power plants, industrial boilers and gold mining, according to the agency. In terms of salvageable mercury, California leads among the states, with 11.6 tons of mercury in vehicles on the road, followed by Texas with 5.8 tons and Florida with 5.6 tons. Recently enacted federal regulations have aimed at reducing emissions from industrial plants, but the recapture of mercury from vehicles has largely been left to state governments, with just a handful, working with automakers, taking action. The new program, to be phased in over the next 12 months, seeks to provide all states with a unified approach, Mr. Johnson said. Companies that dismantle or shred older cars and trucks will remove mercury from light switches, as well as brakes, before crushing the vehicles into scrap. Automakers will be responsible and pay for much of the process. Along with steelmakers, the automakers will develop incentives for companies that remove the mercury before scrapping. Automakers formed the End of Life Vehicle Solutions Corporation in September to manage the program. Mr. Johnson predicted that the program would remove 75 tons of mercury over the next 15 years."
"The largest health study yet of the thousands of workers who labored at ground zero shows that the impact of the rescue and recovery effort on their health has been more widespread and persistent than previously thought, and is likely to linger far into the future. The study, released yesterday by doctors at Mount Sinai Medical Center, is expected to erase any lingering doubts about the connection between dust from the trade center and numerous diseases that the workers have reported suffering. It is also expected to increase pressure on the federal government to provide health care for sick workers who do not have health insurance. Roughly 70 percent of nearly 10,000 workers tested at Mount Sinai from 2002 to 2004 reported that they had new or substantially worsened respiratory problems while or after working at ground zero. The rate is similar to that found among a smaller sample of 1,100 such workers released by Mount Sinai in 2004, but the scale of the current study gives it far more weight; it also indicates significant problems not reflected in the original study. For example, one-third of the patients in the new study showed diminished lung capacity in tests designed to measure the amount of air a person can exhale. Among nonsmokers, 28 percent were found to have some breathing impairment, more than double the rate for nonsmokers in the general population. The study is among the first to show that many of the respiratory ailments -- like sinusitis and asthma, and gastrointestinal problems related to them -- initially reported by ground zero workers persisted or grew worse in the years after 9/11. Most of the ground zero workers in the study who reported trouble breathing while working there were still having those problems up to two and a half years later, an indication that the illnesses are becoming chronic and are not likely to improve over time. Some of them worked without face masks, or with flimsy ones. ''There should no longer be any doubt about the health effects of the World Trade Center disaster,'' said Dr. Robin Herbert, co-director of Mount Sinai's World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program. ''Our patients are sick, and they will need ongoing care for the rest of their lives.'' Dr. Herbert called the findings, which will be published tomorrow in Environmental Health Perspectives, the journal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, ''very worrisome,'' especially because 40 percent of those who went to Mount Sinai for medical screening did not have health insurance, and will thus not get proper medical care. The Mount Sinai results found, as studies done by the New York City Fire Department also have, that those who showed up in the first hours and days after the twin towers collapsed have the worst medical problems. Seventy percent of the workers in the study arrived at the site between Sept. 11 and Sept. 13. Mount Sinai's screening and monitoring program, which excludes New York firefighters, who are tested in a separate program, run by the New York Fire Department, covers law enforcement officers, transit workers, telecommunications workers, volunteers and others who worked at ground zero and at the Fresh Kills landfill, where debris was taken. Members of the New York Congressional delegation, who have been fighting to get the federal government to recognize the scope of the health problem created by toxic materials at ground zero, saw the Mount Sinai study as proof that the federal government has been too slow to address the issue. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who participated in the news conference at Mount Sinai yesterday morning, along with Representatives Jerrold Nadler and Carolyn B. Maloney, said that the results made the need for federal assistance for treatment more critical than ever. ''This study, I hope, puts to rest any doubt about what is happening to those who were exposed,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who was among those who pushed for $52 million in federal funding for health treatment for the ground zero workers, the first treatment money provided by the Bush administration. ''This report underscores the need for continued long-term monitoring and treatment options -- they go hand in hand,'' she said. Several members of the delegation are scheduled to meet in Washington tomorrow morning with Michael O. Levitt, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, to press for more aid. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, speaking at a news conference at City Hall yesterday, questioned the conclusiveness of the study, saying that statistics could suggest a connection between events, but not prove a direct link. ''I don't believe that you can say specifically a particular problem came from this particular event,'' he said. Nonetheless, Mr. Bloomberg announced that the city would create a screening and treatment program for anyone exposed to the trade center dust or fumes. The Mount Sinai study, released yesterday, which covers 9,442 workers who met the screening program's eligibility criteria and agreed to have their health data included, focused on respiratory problems because doctors believe those illnesses are the first to surface. Of those studied, 46.5 percent reported symptoms like chest tightness, shortness of breath and dry cough that generally affect the lower airways of the lungs. And 62.5 percent reported upper-respiratory symptoms like sinusitis and nose and throat irritations. (The study did not include cases of cancer reported by workers and their relatives.) The doctors said that the persistent nature of the respiratory symptoms raised troubling questions about the workers' long-term health. Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, a founder of the screening program at Mount Sinai and an author of the new study, said that the toxic nature of the trade center dust had led doctors to conclude that there would be serious health issues for years to come, especially for workers who were exposed to the heaviest concentrations in the early days after the terrorist attack. ''This was extremely toxic dust,'' Dr. Landrigan said, noting that some samples showed the dust to be as caustic as drain cleaner. The dust also contained innumerable tiny shards of glass, which could get lodged in the lungs, and a stew of toxic and carcinogenic substances, like asbestos and dioxin, that could potentially lead to cancer decades from now. With the expanding dimensions of 9/11 health problems, concern is also growing about the cost of health care for responders, particularly the 40 percent who either never had health insurance or who lost employer-provided coverage after they became too sick to work. Dr. Landrigan declined to estimate what the total cost might be, saying only ''it will be very expensive.'' Dr. John Howard, who was named the federal 9/11 health coordinator in February, has already said that the $52 million the federal government has appropriated for treatment late last year is inadequate. He said in an interview yesterday that the new study will very likely mean that the gap between funds and the need for them is going to grow. But he said the solid medical data from Mount Sinai would help him make the case that more needs to be done. He said that there was little doubt that if a third of the people in the study showed abnormal breathing, similar problems exist among the entire population of 40,000 rescue and recovery workers. ''These are just the kind of facts that are important in making a logical argument that the funding needs to be adjusted,'' said Dr. Howard, who is also the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Mount Sinai officials said they would release a study of mental health effects on ground zero workers soon. They also are planning to begin a statistical program this fall to examine the occurrence of cancer, lung diseases and other ailments among that group. That information will then be compared to national rates to see if there is a higher-than-expected incidence of those diseases."
"Five years after the World Trade Center towers collapsed in a vortex of dust and ash, government officials have only recently begun to take a role in the care of many of the 40,000 responders and recovery workers who were made sick by toxic materials at ground zero. But for many of the ill and those worried about becoming sick, government actions -- coming from officials whom they see as more concerned about the politics of the moment than the health of those who responded to the emergency -- are too limited and too late. The delay in assistance along with a lack of rigorous inquiry into the magnitude of the environmental disaster unleashed that day is all the more disturbing, they say, as the country faces a future in which such disasters could happen again. Dr. John Howard, who was appointed by the Bush administration in February to coordinate the federal government's 9/11 health efforts, readily admits that costly delays and missed opportunities may have shattered responders' trust in the government. ''I can understand the frustration and the anger, and most importantly, the concern about their future,'' Dr. Howard said in an interview. ''I can't blame them for thinking, 'Where were you when we needed you?' '' A review of recent federal initiatives reveals a pattern of the government's not fully delivering what was promised. Dr. Howard's office, for example, has no full-time staff members assigned to 9/11 health issues. For the first time, money for treatment -- $52 million -- has been included in the federal budget, but even the officials responsible concede that it is not nearly enough. And only last week did New York City release clinical guidelines that could help doctors properly diagnose 9/11-related illnesses. ''They seem to be running from the people who are sick, not standing with them and helping them,'' said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat who represents parts of Manhattan and Queens and has been critical of federal efforts at ground zero. ''And that is just plain wrong.'' One of the thorniest problems, and one reason officials have given for the long delay in responding, is the difficulty of linking the dust and smoke to specific symptoms and diseases. Making a medical diagnosis for illnesses related to toxic substance exposure requires extensive and sophisticated tests. Simply measuring the toxicity of the dust has proved to be controversial. And state workers' compensation systems, designed to handle common workplace injuries like broken arms, are not well suited for determining an illness that may take months or years to emerge. Even so, clinical evidence of a serious health problem surfaced not long after the attack. Initial studies of firefighters found that many had developed ''trade center cough,'' a stubborn hacking that caused them to cough up soot and dust particles. A large-scale medical study came out in 2004, when the Mount Sinai Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported that more than half of the first 1,138 workers it had examined had serious respiratory problems. Workers also suffered gastrointestinal problems, acid reflux, asthma and mental stress. (Mount Sinai is scheduled to release a far larger study today, and it is expected to show serious ailments among many more workers.) Successive studies through the years have found that the health hazards were more persistent than first thought. A Fire Department study released this year showed that firefighters had suffered a loss in lung capacity in the first year after the attack equal to what they might have lost over 12 years of normal duty. The department has also found that the incidence of sarcoidosis, a serious lung scarring disease, rose to five times the expected rate in the first two years after 9/11. An initial survey released in April of the 71,437 responders, residents and downtown workers who signed up for the World Trade Center Health Registry, run by the city and the federal government, showed that more than half said that they had experienced new or worsening respiratory problems since 9/11. And a Red Cross survey in May found that two-thirds of the responders and survivors who sought help in coping with emotional distress believe that grief still interferes with their lives. One death -- that of 34-year-old Detective James Zadroga in January -- has been formally linked by a coroner's report to lung disease caused by trade center dust. The families of at least six other responders who died believe those deaths were also linked to toxic substance exposure at ground zero. When Dr. Howard was appointed a few weeks after Detective Zadroga died, many in the city were relieved to have a federal czar in charge. But Dr. Howard, who was trained as a pulmonary specialist and is the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has not assigned a single one of his 1,300 employees to work full time on ground zero medical issues, though about 20 work on such issues part time. And though the institute has a budget of about $285 million, he has not received any additional money to address the complex medical issues involved. ''I'm a czar without a budget,'' he said. Meanwhile, the need for treatment assistance has grown as more people have become ill. While many rescue and recovery workers are covered by their own health insurance, that coverage may become inadequate in the years ahead. Many union workers, for example, can lose their coverage if they become too sick to work, while most illegal immigrants who worked there had no insurance. Some 16,000 union workers and volunteers have been examined through the screening and monitoring program run by Mount Sinai, which began in 2002 with $11.4 million in federal money and was extended in 2004 for five years with an additional $81 million. (Information about the program is available at www.wtcexams.org.) But until last year, there was almost no money available for treatment through the screening program. With $9.4 million from the Red Cross, Mount Sinai doctors were able to treat 2,050 responders last year, offering them therapy, medications and medical procedures in some cases. Ms. Maloney and other members of the New York Congressional delegation, in pushing for more federal aid, succeeded last December in getting the Bush administration to restore $125 million in unused workers' compensation assistance that it had threatened to take back. Of the $125 million, about $50 million was set aside for future workers' compensation awards and about $52 million was split equally between two treatment programs -- one for firefighters and another for injured police officers, union workers and other responders, but not office workers or neighborhood residents. A working group appointed by Dr. Howard has not yet determined which diseases will be eligible for treatment with the new money or whether the money will cover hospital stays as well as office visits. But he recognizes that it is not nearly enough to cover New York's needs, let alone the national treatment program he intends to start. ''You don't have to go to cancers years from now, or asbestosis, to be able to say 'Gee, John, how far do you think this money is going to go?' '' Dr. Howard said. ''I don't think it will go that far.'' Besides the lack of money for treatment, the absence of timely public health information made it more likely that doctors who initially saw sick responders would be unprepared to treat what they found. Doctors at Mount Sinai have said that up to a third of the workers they examined were taking improper medications because their doctors had misdiagnosed their symptoms. Severe sinusitis, for example, was treated with antibiotics even though that condition might have been caused by chemical burns from the caustic dust. Yet it was not until Thursday, days before the fifth anniversary, that the city issued diagnostic guidelines for the unusual illnesses linked to ground zero dust, despite urging by medical specialists and labor leaders as early as December 2001. ''This is a significant failure of the public health system,'' said Micki Siegel de Hernandez, health and safety director for District 1 of the Communications Workers of America. Ms. Siegel de Hernandez contended that the city delayed releasing the guidelines because it was worried that acknowledging the extent of the health problems might increase its legal liability. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, commissioner of the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in an interview that the city had decided it made more sense for the doctors at Mount Sinai's screening program to put guidelines on their Web site because they were seeing the workers while the city's medical staff was not. Mount Sinai did publish guidelines in early 2002, but they did not carry the weight of an official city advisory and had limited impact. ''We lost opportunities by not disseminating guidelines widely or at least putting out a caution,'' Dr. Howard said. Dr. Frieden agreed that if they had been released sooner, the guidelines might have helped clinicians make more accurate diagnoses. ''Would I rather have had the guidelines out sooner? Sure,'' he said this summer. ''But it's important to get this right.'' He said the delay had nothing to do with concerns about the city's legal liability for sick responders. About 8,000 responders have sued the city and the big contractors who worked for the city in the recovery operations, charging them with reckless disregard for workers' health. The city has asked a federal court in Manhattan to dismiss the suit. Although five years have passed, many questions about the environmental disaster at ground zero remain unanswered. To this day, the government has never precisely measured where the dust went, information that could help determine the health impact on residents near ground zero. And it is unclear whether cancers, possibly linked to the toxic materials, will arise in future years, or if some of the sick will get better. For now, among the sick and their doctors, the faltering and delayed governmental response raises unsettling questions about whether the country is prepared to handle a similar catastrophe. ''I think of that every time I come to New York,'' Dr. Howard said. ''Given this betrayal of trust, this lack of being there at the time and all these other things, I don't know. We can try with what we have, but it certainly is a different situation when you do it five years later.'' Correction: September 7, 2006, Thursday A front-page article on Tuesday about the delayed federal response to 9/11 health claims misstated the amount of federal money given to Mount Sinai Medical Center for a screening and monitoring program. Mount Sinai received $40.1 million of an $81 million outlay, not all of it. The rest was distributed to the New York Fire Department and other medical centers in the New York region."
"AFTER years of carving up tuna carcasses in my bathtub, catching cod in the dead of winter and cooking fish and chips for crowds of 50-plus I have come to be known among my friends as the fish guy. Until recently I've enjoyed being the fish guy and my ability to correctly answer questions about fish has felt like a game of ''Jeopardy'' rigged for my benefit. How do you tell a flounder from a fluke? Easy, fluke have prominent teeth, flounder don't. Should bluefish and striped bass be cooked differently? Definitely: broil the bluefish, bake the bass. But lately being the fish guy has become complicated. With every new warning about a species being overfished into extinction, friends have started asking if they should eat fish at all. The Pew Oceans Commission report ''America's Living Oceans'' first alerted the public to the desperate state of the seas in 2003 when it declared them to be ''in crisis.'' That year a study in the journal Nature reported that up to 90 percent of the stocks of the ocean's major predators (Atlantic cod and bluefin tuna to name two) have been wiped out. In the next few weeks, Congress will debate what to do about the dire state of the nation's fisheries when it takes up the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens fisheries management act. Making matters more problematic, numerous recent studies on methyl mercury and PCB's have connected these pollutants in fish with health problems like birth defects, heart disease and memory loss. It might now seem advisable for a fish guy to hang up his hooks and start pushing flax or any of the other dull foods that contain the legendary Omega-3 fatty acid -- a compound found in fish that ameliorates as many ills as the fish-borne contaminants seem to aggravate. But for those of us who feel passionately about the ocean, abstinence is just not an option. Unlike the land animals we confine to pens, fatten on synthetic feed and selectively breed for growth, most fish we eat roam the open ocean, hunt down prey and choose their mates according to their own inexplicable desires. They feed us without any interference on our part. Giving up on fish would mean the end of the last large-scale hunter-gatherer relationship we have with wild food, as well as signal our capitulation in the fight to save the oceans. If we can learn to harvest wild fish sustainably we will have succeeded in something we have failed at on land: finding a balance with a naturally productive ecosystem. In addition, by keeping a food connection with the ocean we will retain a motivation to stop polluting it. The route to a well-managed sea is not as difficult as many environmental problems. And, curiously, many of the modifications that would repair the damage we have done to marine fisheries would also steer us clear of mercury and PCB contamination. With that in mind here are some things to strive toward: First, go vegetarian, in a manner of speaking. Farmed fish have gotten a bad name in recent years -- even while our production of them has grown to rival the wild fish harvest, as the Food and Agriculture Organization reported this week. This is mostly because the farmed fish we eat in the West are carnivores. Raising carnivores like salmon requires the capture of wild prey fish that wild fish also consume. By eating farmed carnivores we rob Peter to pay Paul, stealing the food source for wild fish and feeding them to farmed. There are, however, species of vegetarian fish that grow well in captivity like tilapia, carp and catfish. Because these fish generally eat lower on the food chain, they are often lower in PCB's and methyl mercury. In our ingredient-obsessed food culture, it might seem boring to order such commonplace fare. But I share the opinion of a fishing boat mate who once told me ''fish is fish.'' Often it's the freshness and the cooking method that make a fish tasty, not its evolutionary provenance. Second, don't eat the cheap fish. Once upon a time, we had more fish than we knew what to do with. The United States government practically shoved fish down consumers' throats after World War II, sponsoring ad campaigns on behalf of the fishing industry and subsidizing institutional purchases of seafood. But decades of this kind of behavior drove us to eat through our fish surpluses and we must now import the majority of our seafood, much of which is supplied by international conglomerates that use unsustainable fishing practices. The modern commercial fishing vessel is most often a trawler -- a large ship that pulls weighted nets along the seafloor, destroying all flora and fauna in its path. This practice does not have to continue. A new generation of hook-and-line fishermen is offering an alternative to trawl-caught fish. Line-caught fish cost more, sometimes twice the price of trawl-caught fish. But shouldn't we be willing to pay more for the chance to eat a truly undomesticated creature? Should we really be paying just a few dollars for a fast-food fish sandwich made from the pureed flesh of a wild animal? Finally, don't eat the big fish. Dining on a 500-pound bluefin tuna is the seafood equivalent of driving a Hummer. Ten pounds of little fish are required to produce one pound of bluefin and all the pollutants contained in a tuna's prey ''bio-concentrate'' in a tuna's flesh, making it a particularly compromised animal, chemically speaking. And because it takes so many little fish to make a big fish, the sea can sustain only a relatively small amount of large fish. It therefore follows that if we reduce our consumption of the big fish we can reduce our mercury and PCB load and reduce the burden we place on the marine environment. Sardines, mackerel and most fish that are shorter in total length than the diameter of a dinner plate are generally safer to eat. I would like to report that I am now a fully reformed fish guy who adheres to all of the above. I know, however, that I would have a hard time throwing back a 500-pound bluefin and that I might be tempted to choose the swordfish over the tilapia in a high-end eatery. But fighting the American urge to consume whatever we want is a battle worth fighting with ourselves, particularly when it comes to the sea. Considering what's at stake is the survival of the ecosystem of the world's oceans, I'd rather eat fewer, smaller and more expensive fish than no fish at all. Op-Ed Contributor Paul Greenberg, the author of the novel ''Leaving Katya,'' is writing a book about seafood."
"The echoes of Sept. 11, 2001, clatter through American life with continuing, tangible effect. In many smaller towns and cities, shiny new fire trucks are the civic antidote to uncertainty -- and the practical need to spend what the Department of Homeland Security dishes out. Other things Americans carry from that day are tiny and poignant, like Rick Edmond's flashlight, always on hand against a return of the darkness that he remembers in the corridors of the Pentagon. Ideas have been amplified and altered by time, war and ideology into things never known or thought about. What does that head scarf say about where your loyalties lie? Who walks with the dead from Iraq and Afghanistan and tells the stories of what they believed in life and why they died? Some echoes define a country at five years in ways many Americans have stopped even thinking about, because they are just life now. Here are five people in five cities -- all of them uncertain in different ways about where they have come to, but resolved to some action or declaration on the nation's road forward. The Fire Department in Colorado Springs is called out hundreds of times a year to deal with things like oil spills on the Interstate, gas pipeline leaks or the odd chemical residue left over from illegal drug labs. And since this summer the hazardous-materials team has responded to those calls by tooling out in a shiny new vehicle paid for by taxpayers around the country through a grant from the Department of Homeland Security. In cities and towns across the United States, five years of fighting terrorism has come closest to home in the form of modern emergency preparedness -- or, critics would suggest, old-fashioned political pork. Sloppy management has also been a big issue. The State of Colorado, one of those under greatest scrutiny, had to return $1.5 million to the federal government this year after a state audit found that the money had been improperly allocated. The inspector general's office at the Homeland Security Department opened a subsequent audit this summer. Bret Waters, director of the Office of Emergency Management in Colorado Springs, said he certainly would not defend every decision made in the spending of more than $154 million that has flowed into the state for domestic security since 2003. But echoing local officials in many other parts of the country, he makes no apologies for the fact that acquisitions like new haz-mat and communications trucks allow his city of 370,000 to be better equipped to handle the routine misfortunes of urban life. In this age of sleeper cells and other hidden threats, Mr. Waters said, his job is to prepare Colorado Springs for the risks that are not routine. And the best way to do that, he said, is to bolster every element in the city's disaster plan, get the best equipment and then put that equipment in the field to practice with day after day. ''If you don't use your equipment, if you wait until a terrorist event happens, you won't know how to use it,'' he said. ''If I set pieces of equipment in closets until there's a terrorism attack in the city of Colorado Springs, I think we'd be foolhardy.'' Still, Mr. Waters, a trim California native who arrived in Colorado Springs a year ago to oversee emergency planning and operations there, said politics had colored the process. Denver in particular, by far the state's leading population center, throws around too much of its influence, he said, and so lands even more antiterrorism money than is warranted by its status as a possible large-city target. ''The obvious risks are obvious to everybody,'' he said. ''You have to protect the Golden Gate Bridge, you have the ports, whatever. The less obvious it is, the more challenge.'' In addition, Colorado Springs has to share the money it gets -- about $9.3 million in federal domestic security grants since 2003 -- with a surrounding five-county region the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. But an even bigger wrinkle, Mr. Waters said, is that the definitions of risk have continued to evolve since the Sept. 11 attacks, especially in the year after Hurricane Katrina. Guidelines for federal grant applications since the hurricane have specifically encouraged consideration of risks broader than terrorism, he said, including natural disaster. That makes local decisions even harder to make, because the what-if menu grows all the time. The neighbors are a complication as well. Colorado Springs has numerous military installations in its backyard, including Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Air Force Academy and headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. The city has prospered from those associations. Thousands of military people who were once stationed in the area have stayed on in retirement, contributing to its economy and its conservative, stiff-spined character. But whether the military bases increase or reduce the burden of possible terrorism is a different matter. On one hand, even if they add to risk, they have their own security budgets to deal with it. Yet they cannot guarantee protection of the city, Mr. Waters said. And neither the state nor the federal government has imposed any objective standards for determining how the pieces should fit together. ''It's more like, 'Locals, figure it out,' '' he said. ''Some have done better than others.'' KIRK JOHNSON ECHOES OF 9/11 DEFINE LIFE 5 YEARS LATER: LOCAL RESPONSE"
"The Environmental Protection Agency and other government regulators have approved a strategy for the methodical, floor-by-floor dismantling of the former Deutsche Bank building opposite ground zero. The approval is a key step in the long-stalled process of demolishing a 41-story eyesore that has become a grim symbol of inaction in Lower Manhattan. The building, at 130 Liberty Street, was heavily damaged and contaminated on Sept. 11, 2001, when debris from the World Trade Center cut a 15-story gash into its north facade. The abandoned tower is supposed to be the future site of Tower 5 of a reconstructed trade center, but the cleanup and dismantling have been repeatedly delayed by concerns over contaminants in the dust and the discovery of hundreds of human remains, including tiny bone fragments. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which owns the building, has conceded that the structure is ''a constant grim reminder'' of 9/11. The corporation is being phased out, and is turning over responsibility for the tower to the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, a city-state entity charged with coordinating building activities downtown. ''Within about four weeks we'll be able to start deconstruction, and the building will be down in September 2007,'' a spokesman for the command center, Daniel McCormack, said yesterday. The approval of a revised implementation plan -- specifying the means and methods for the demolition work -- occurred on Thursday, in a letter from Pat Evangelista, the E.P.A. coordinator for the World Trade Center site, to Max S. Lee, an acting deputy borough commissioner at the city's Department of Buildings. The approval was reported in The Daily News yesterday. Bonnie Bellow, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, said yesterday that the approval rested on three issues: preventing contaminants from being released into the environment during the deconstruction, ensuring proper monitoring during the dismantling, and safely disposing of hazardous waste. Other agencies that have oversight over the cleanup and demolition of the building are the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the United States Department of Labor; the state's Department of Labor and Department of Environmental Conservation, and the city's Department of Environmental Protection. The approval, however, is not the final hurdle before the dismantling of the building can begin. The development corporation or the command center must still obtain a series of permits from the Buildings Department, and before any dismantling can occur, demonstrate that the affected area has been cleaned up. ''Right now there are no plans filed for the deconstruction,'' a Buildings Department spokeswoman, Ilyse Fink, said yesterday. ''The intent is that the work will be done in phases and that we will not give a permit until we get clearance from the E.P.A. that the abatement on each floor has been completed.'' David M. Newman, the industrial hygienist at the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a nonprofit group that has closely monitored the abatement and demolition plans, said there had not been adequate public participation. ''Does the latest approval constitute a general and credible safety endorsement?'' he asked. ''And how can anyone tell in the absence of a public discussion?'' The project has faced numerous hurdles. It was first tied up in litigation between Deutsche Bank, which considered the structure a total loss, and its insurers, which considered the building to be structurally sound. George J. Mitchell, a former senator from Maine, mediated the dispute so that the development corporation could acquire the building. In September 2004, an environmental study confirmed high levels of asbestos, dioxin, lead and other contaminants in the building. The development corporation released a draft plan for the demolition in December 2004, but in February 2005, E.P.A. officials warned that the plan did not provide for adequate monitoring of air quality. In September 2005, E.P.A. officials approved an abatement plan, but days later bone fragments were found on the building's roof."
"Dark as soy sauce, perfumed with a chemical stench, the liquid waste from two paper mills overwhelmed the tiny village of Sugai. Villagers tried to construct a makeshift dike, but the toxic water swept it away. Fifty-seven homes sank into a black, polluted lake. The April 10 industrial spill, described by five residents of the village in Inner Mongolia, was a small-scale environmental disaster in a country with too many of them. But Sugai should have been different. The two mills had already been sued in a major case, fined and ordered to upgrade their pollution equipment after a serious spill into the Yellow River in 2004. The official response to that spill, praised by the state-run news media, seemed to showcase a new, tougher approach toward pollution -- until the later spill at Sugai revealed that local officials had never carried out the cleanup orders. Now, the destruction of Sugai is a lesson in the difficulty of enforcing environmental rules in China. ''The smell made me want to vomit,'' one villager said recently, as he showed the waist-high watermark on the remains of his home. There is no shortage of environmental laws and regulations in China, many of them passed in recent years by a central government trying to address one of the worst pollution problems in the world. But those problems persist, in part, because environmental protection is often subverted by local protectionism, corruption and regulatory inefficiency. Even as many domestic and international environmental groups now credit China with beginning to take the environment seriously, pollution is actually worsening in some crucial categories. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, the building block of acid rain, rose by 27 percent between 2000 and 2005; government projections had called for a 20 percent reduction. ''It is clear the conflict between economic growth and environmental protection is coming to a head,'' said Zhou Shengxian, director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, or SEPA, according to the official New China News Agency. The broader tension of balancing environmental protection with fast economic growth is not likely to ease. China wants to double the size of its economy by 2020. And yet Mr. Zhou did not hesitate to assign much of the blame for the undercutting of pollution control efforts to corruption and fraud by local officials. Despite its rising public profile, the State Environmental Protection Administration remains one of the weakest agencies in the central government bureaucracy and has sought to increase its regulatory powers. For years, it has complained that local environmental protection bureaus are accountable to local officials rather than the state agency. This has meant that local regulators had to answer to mayors or other local officials who may have had financial or other interests in protecting polluting industries. In early August, SEPA announced that it would establish 11 regional offices to monitor pollution problems better. The agency also announced that local officials eligible for promotion would be judged on their pollution track record, in addition to how well they deliver economic growth. Public disgust over pollution is growing. In May, the official English-language newspaper China Daily reported that more than 50,000 disputes and protests arose in 2005 over pollution. Public complaints to the national environmental administration rose by 30 percent. ''We have heard many complaints saying. 'no clean official, no clean water,' '' Zhang Lijun, a deputy director at SEPA, told China Daily. Here in Urad Qianqi, a city along the Yellow River that encompasses Sugai, officials delayed for almost five weeks before finally refusing to be interviewed about the spill. Provincial officials also declined to talk, as did administrators with the paper mills and the local irrigation district. In July, a reporter, photographer and researcher for The New York Times visited the village after being warned it was under official watch to prevent outsiders from entering. After nightfall, a sedan without license plates pursued the Times's hired car and tried to force it to the side of the road. The Times's car escaped to a highway but was later stopped by the police, who questioned the driver for about three hours. Even without official cooperation, the basic chronology of the Sugai spill can be reconstructed through interviews with villagers, the handful of accounts in the Chinese news media and reports issued by the environmental agency. For decades, the two factories, Saiwai Xinghuazhang Paper Company and Meili Beichen Paper Company, dumped their toxic sludge directly into the Yellow River. Five years ago, the introduction of new regulations ended that dumping, and factories began pumping the waste instead into a long drainage canal connected to the region's intricate irrigation and flood protection system. But in June 2004, the commission that regulates the irrigation system decided to address rising water levels in the system by dumping polluted canal water into the Yellow River. The release created a pollution slick that killed tens of thousands of fish and plunged the downstream city of Baotou into a drinking water crisis that lasted several days. Industrial accidents are common in China. Millions of residents in Harbin, in northeastern China, were forced to depend on bottled water after a major benzene spill contaminated the Songhua River last November. During the first four months of 2006, SEPA reported another 49 ''major'' industrial accidents and illegal pollution discharges. A study it released last month found that roughly 80 percent of China's 7,555 more heavily polluting factories are located on rivers, lakes or in heavily populated areas. The official handling of the 2004 spill into the Yellow River was initially considered a groundbreaking success. The city of Baotou was awarded almost $300,000 in damages from the two factories and the irrigation district in what state news media called the first pollution lawsuit on the Yellow River. Government agencies ordered the factories shut down to install water recycling and treatment equipment. SEPA ordered the mills to comply with national water emission requirements. Officials in Urad Qianqi decided instead to build large, temporary wastewater containment pools directly beside the river. Li Wanzhong, director of the Inner Mongolia Environmental Protection Bureau, concluded that those pools were a threat to the river. China Environment News, the official publication of the state environmental administration, reported that Mr. Li had ordered Urad Qianqi to close the factories if they continued to violate emissions standards. But the factories were never closed. Then, a violent storm last April set off a crisis. High winds threatened to push wastewater from the pools into the Yellow River. Villagers were told that officials feared another spill into the river would expose their failure to carry out earlier orders. So officials ordered that a containment pool wall be broken so that wastewater could be diverted into a three-mile strip beside the river where several small villages, including Sugai, stood. The only warning came from a Sugai villager who made a surreptitious telephone call from his job at one of the factories. A dozen farmers frantically tried to build a mud dike. ''The water was too high, and it didn't work,'' said one 37-year-old farmer, who, like other villagers, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. ''The water came all of a sudden. It was poisonous water, but I don't know what poisons were in it.'' Three months after the spill, the homes remained uninhabitable. Large pools of black water festered in the lowest-lying areas. All but three houses -- built on higher ground -- had been abandoned. The farmland, once considered among the best in the area, was contaminated. Most residents had relocated to nearby villages after receiving cash settlements based on the size of their home. ''The reason this accident happened is that the local government didn't follow the directives of the central government,'' said a 40-year-old man whose father had lived in the village. He added, ''They also wanted to protect the local industries.'' Urad Qianqi's Communist Party secretary, Jia Yingxiang, later told the New China News Agency that installing the required wastewater treatment plants was too expensive. He said factories were allowed to reopen because so many local workers were dependent on them. In fact, Urad Qianqi officials had promised in 2000 to build water treatment equipment but never did. Environmental regulators did examine the containment pools at the two paper mills. A government report after the April spill deemed the pools to be substandard and said that local officials and factory bosses had reduced the height of the walls to save money. Health problems connected to the spill had begun to emerge in July. A dozen or more Sugai villagers had severe rashes on their legs. On July 13, government doctors arrived with ointments. ''The doctors didn't say what was wrong with me,'' said one 40-year-old mother with large red welts and rashes on her thighs. ''It is hard to sleep at night because of the itching.'' Her husband, meanwhile, is worried about supporting his family. ''Even if we put seeds in the earth there,'' the man, 44, said, ''they won't grow because the pollution is too severe.''"
"The Environmental Protection Agency is requiring significant reductions in the amount of cancer-causing benzene and other toxic hydrocarbon gases in gasoline and released into the air during storage and use, under a rule released Friday. The final rule, issued under a court-ordered deadline set after environmental groups filed suit about two years ago, provides more uniform reductions around the country than the agency had originally proposed. It was greeted with praise from environmental groups usually critical of the Bush administration in this area and with considerably less enthusiasm by the organization representing the country's 149 refineries. The rule puts a ceiling on the total benzene content of any gasoline produced after 2011. The rule limits opportunities for those refineries that are not meeting the benzene limit to meet their obligation by buying credits from other refineries whose gasoline more than meets the standard. ''Benzene content in gasoline is going to go significantly down everywhere in the country,'' said William Wehrum, the agency's acting assistant administrator of air and radiation programs. ''Are there going to be variations from place to place? Yes.'' The original proposal would have given refineries more leeway to average the benzene content across their entire gasoline supply. That would have left some regions, particularly parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountain States, with benzene levels well above the levels permissible elsewhere, because their gasoline has historically contained more benzene. Objections by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, played a role in the agency's decision instead to limit the trading program, Mr. Wehrum said. In addition to the new benzene limits for gasoline, the new rule also orders cuts for benzene levels in tailpipe emissions and pungent benzene vapors escaping from gasoline cans. The new standard will cut 19,643 tons of benzene from gasoline when the controls on refiners take effect in four years. In addition, several other rules currently in force will have the side effect of cutting benzene from all of these sources, reducing benzene from its 1999 level of 250,000 tons, the most recent figure available. The agency estimated that the new rule, called the Mobile Source Air Toxics rule, would result in 33,000 tons of reductions by 2015. Those reduction, combined with the additional reductions that were side benefits of other rules, would cut the benzene levels down to 108,000 tons. ''Cars and trucks put out a whole toxic soup of pollutants,'' Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, one of the two groups that sued the agency, said in an interview. ''The administration is going after one of them. Benzene poses a whole host of health risks. It's a good thing that they strengthened the standard.'' But Charles Drevna, the executive vice president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, said the agency had ''thrown a curve'' by insisting on a ceiling on the amount of benzene in any refinery's gasoline, which limits the refinery's ability to use allowances. ''Certain areas are going to have a much more difficult time,'' Mr. Drevna said, including those refineries in the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains. California's current standard for benzene is already below the new national standard, so that state's 13 refineries are not affected. In highly industrialized areas like the Northeast and the Chicago area are already required to produce what is known as reformulated gasoline, and so their benzene levels have been reduced somewhat in recent years, though not as much as they will be under the new rule. Mr. Drevna said that a spate of new rules, including a rule making steep cuts in the sulfur content of diesel fuel and a separate rule reducing the sulfur content of gasoline, have put a burden on refiners. Mr. Wehrum, of the federal agency, said the trading program was designed ''to allow the flexibility for industry to find the most cost-effective place to spend.'' For Mr. Drevna, it was not flexible enough. For Marti Sinclair of the Sierra Club, which was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, it was too much. ''We are happy that E.P.A. has addressed this important public health issue at last,'' Ms. Sinclair said in a statement, adding, ''It is disappointing that E.P.A. would undermine its own program by adopting this dangerous trading scheme.''"
"A truck bomb that combined explosives with chlorine gas blew up in southern Baghdad on Wednesday, and officials said it might represent a new and deadly tactic by insurgents against Iraqi civilians. It was at least the third truck bomb in a month to employ chlorine, a greenish gas also used in World War I, which burns the skin and can be fatal after only a few concentrated breaths. The bomb killed at least two people and wounded 32 others, many of them sent to hospitals coughing and wheezing, police and medical officials said. Iraqi and American officials said the use of chlorine seemed aimed at bringing a new level of fear and havoc to Iraq as a new security plan for Baghdad takes shape. Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman, said the attacks highlighted the fluidity of insurgent tactics in Iraq, dominated by militant groups that often notice and repeat attacks that attract the most attention and cause the most suffering. Insurgents have shifted tactics to focus on helicopters, and on Wednesday one group forced down an American Black Hawk helicopter, the eighth such incident since Jan. 20. Roadside bombs have been adapted to punch through heavily armored Humvees. Attacks on Americans also now include coordinated assaults from multiple locations, with a mix of weapons and in at least one case, counterfeit American uniforms and vehicles. ''The enemy is adaptive,'' Colonel Garver said. ''The enemy wants to win.'' The Black Hawk attacked on Wednesday was forced into a ''hard landing'' after taking fire from heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in Diyala Province, north of Baghdad, the United States military said. There were no injuries. A Sunni insurgent group, the Mujahedeen Army, claimed responsibility for the attack in an Internet posting, according to the SITE Institute, which tracks postings by insurgent groups. The bombing involving chlorine gas on Wednesday followed an explosion on Tuesday north of Baghdad of a tanker filled with chlorine that had been rigged to explode, killing nine people and wounding 148, including 42 women and 52 children. At least one other attack with chlorine took place on Jan. 28, according to the American military's statements. Sixteen people were killed in that attack, in the Sunni-dominated Anbar Province, when a dump truck with explosives and a chlorine tank blew up in Ramadi. The attacks seem to have been poorly executed, burning the chemical agent rather than dispersing it, but more sophisticated weapons involving chlorine could injure hundreds and cause mass panic. Though it is widely used in water purification and sewage treatment, chlorine is dangerous because it reacts with water in moist tissue, such as eyes and the respiratory tract, to create acid, which essentially burns tissue. A few breaths of air containing chlorine at a thousand parts per million can be lethal. Nine people were killed and 250 injured in 2005 after a train crash in South Carolina in which 60 tons of liquefied chlorine was released -- about six times more than what is contained in a home heating fuel truck like the one used in the attack on Tuesday. Exposures at far lower concentrations, down to two parts per million, cause coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, burning in the throat, nose and eyes, nausea and swelling of the lungs. A few hours after the attack, American Humvees and a military vehicle with a nozzle that appeared to be testing the air encircled the scene. Soldiers were not wearing masks, but officials at Yarmouk hospital said they had determined through interviews and tests that chlorine was used in the attack. Brig. Qasim Atta, an Iraqi government spokesman for the new Baghdad security plan, described chlorine attacks as a ''filthy way'' to harm vulnerable Iraqis. Colonel Garver said that the chemical attacks could soon appear again. ''It's no surprise that anti-Iraqi forces or terrorists or whoever is doing this are trying to replicate this kind of attack,'' he said. ''They perceive that it's working.'' The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday also indicated that the Baghdad security plan had pushed the violence beyond the city's central neighborhoods, the focus of the new plan. Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, a United States military spokesman in Baghdad, said that the ''belt around Baghdad'' had experienced an increase in attacks as Iraqi and American forces concentrated on neighborhoods within. At a briefing in the Green Zone, he said that top commanders were considering assigning at least one brigade to the ring around the city, and perhaps another to Diyala Province, which has been the site of vicious battles between Sunni insurgents and American and Iraqi troops. The witnesses to the helicopter crash, also in Diyala, said that three helicopters, including a double-rotor Chinook, were flying at tree level when gunmen began firing antiaircraft machine guns from an area near an oil pipeline. A resident who would give his name only as Ali said the back of one helicopter burst into flames, leading the aircraft to turn sideways and plunge to the ground. Two other witnesses said they saw fire coming from the helicopter as it crashed around 1 p.m. Violence broke out on Wednesday in the southern Shiite holy city of Najaf, when a suicide car bomber detonated as Iraqi security forces checked the car for weapons at a checkpoint into the center of city. The explosion occurred about a half a mile from the Imam Ali mosque, one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines, and killed at least 11 people, the police said. Another 34 were wounded. The American military also said a soldier had been killed by gunfire in a northern neighborhood of Baghdad and a marine had died from combat in Anbar Province, where American troops were battling Sunni insurgents. Both died Tuesday. Meanwhile, despite the increased military effort, 20 bodies were found Wednesday in the capital, an Interior Ministry official said. In addition to the chlorine attack, four bombs ripped through areas of the city, killing at least six people, while mortar shells rained down on a Sunni neighborhood of western Baghdad, leaving three people dead. The deadliest attack came about 5:30 p.m., when an abandoned car exploded in Sadr City, the largest Shiite area of the capital, killing at least four people, witnesses said. Fatma al-Saiedi, 35, who was wounded in the explosion, said the attacks were a result of the new plan, which has replaced the Mahdi Army, a Shiite militia, with what she and some other residents say are incompetent Iraqi policemen and soldiers. ''We trusted the Mahdi Army,'' she said. ''The Americans have arrested so many of them, and now this happens -- every day, another car bomb. We expect there to be more of them.'' THE REACH OF WAR"
"New York State moved to sue Exxon Mobil and four other companies on Thursday to force them to clean up a half-century-old spill of millions of gallons of oil lying under the Greenpoint neighborhood in Brooklyn and to repair environmental damage inflicted on nearby Newtown Creek. The spill, originally several times the size of the Exxon Valdez oil leak, resulted from an accident in the 1950s and lay undiscovered until 1978. In notices of intent to sue that were sent to the five companies, Andrew M. Cuomo, the state attorney general, said that so much oil had leaked into the creek that some samples of its sediment, when dried and weighed, were nearly one-tenth oil. The notices also disclosed that an internal study by one of the companies found nearly 100 different pollutants in the creek water or sediment, including benzene, arsenic and lead. The other companies receiving the notices were BP, Chevron, KeySpan and Phelps Dodge. The state's action is a sharp turning point in its handling of the spill, which in recent years has occasioned lawsuits by Greenpoint residents, local elected officials and environmental groups. A 1990 agreement between Exxon Mobil and state environmental officials had required the company to recover the spilled oil, but it specified no deadline and required no remediation of either the creek or the polluted soil under Greenpoint. About eight million gallons of oil and petroleum byproducts are believed to remain underground, and past soil tests have revealed that the spill releases toxic vapors into the neighborhood above. Mr. Cuomo's action will seek a far faster pace for recovering the oil, extensive scientific testing to determine damage to the soil and groundwater, and millions of dollars in fines. Cleanup costs could increase the companies' expense by tens of millions of dollars, Mr. Cuomo's aides said. ''This is one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation, larger than the Exxon Valdez and slower in the cleanup,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ''Exxon Mobil must and will be held accountable. The toxic footprint of Exxon Mobil is found all over this area. It is Exxon Mobil's oil that remains under the homes and businesses. And it is Exxon Mobil that has dragged its feet and done as little as possible to address the dangers that it created.'' According to the notices, Exxon Mobil's current mechanisms for recovering the spilled oil have, as a side effect, discharged yet more pollutants into the creek, a process that the company has been aware of for years, the notices say. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said on Thursday that Exxon Mobil had also been reselling some of the recovered oil, even as it allowed the creek to become more polluted. Barry Wood, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said the company had not received the notices. In a statement, he said the company had already helped recover more than 9.3 million gallons of the petroleum products. ''While the cost of remediation at the site is confidential, Exxon Mobil is committed to remediation of the site, and we have been aggressive in our efforts and have made significant progress,'' Mr. Wood said. He added that the company remained committed to its 1990 agreement with the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. ''We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously and have committed substantial resources toward cleaning up the site,'' he said. ''Complex remediation projects such as this, where the product to be recovered is under ground and not easily accessible, takes time to complete.'' Phelps Dodge operated a copper smelting plant on the creek's north bank, in Queens, where studies have found heavy metals and other pollutants. Companies later acquired by KeySpan owned gas processing facilities along the waterway that contaminated the creek's sediments with some of the same pollutants and other toxic chemicals, according to the notices. Companies later acquired by Chevron and BP operated storage or refinery facilities along the creek that leaked oil into the ground, according to the notices. Together, the notices significantly widen the scope of state legal action concerning the creek, a dirty, 3.5-mile-long estuary that marks Brooklyn's northern border and flows into the East River. Local politicians said yesterday that they believed Mr. Cuomo's actions would pave the way for a long-overdue cleanup of the creek and its transformation into a recreational waterway. ''The Brooklyn-Queens waterfront has the potential to be New York's Gold Coast, with sparkling towers, schools, parks and libraries,'' said Eric Gioia, a City Council member whose Queens district abuts the creek. ''Cleaning Newtown Creek is critical to that vision.'' Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who took over investigation of the spill from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation last year when he was attorney general, praised Mr. Cuomo's decision. ''This is an important day for the people of Greenpoint, Brooklyn,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''It is imperative that Exxon Mobil and the other companies responsible for this pollution be held fully accountable.'' When first discovered, the spill was estimated at 17 million gallons of oil and oil products spread over 100 acres. Currently, the spill covers about 55 acres. For years, Greenpoint residents have watched as environmentalists battled state officials and the companies responsible for the oil. In 2004, Riverkeeper, an environmental group, decided to file its own lawsuit against Exxon Mobil. The following summer, soil tests performed by the group showed toxic fumes coming from the ground over the spill. That caused a second lawsuit by about two dozen Greenpoint residents. Both suits are active, but local officials and environmental groups said Mr. Cuomo's move would put significant new pressure on Exxon Mobil. ''They have managed to manipulate and work with previous administrations and enlist their help in avoiding a serious remediation,'' said Alex Matthiessen, the president of Riverkeeper. ''Attorney General Cuomo's notice letter brings that to a screeching halt.'' Federal laws require Mr. Cuomo to give the companies advance notice of his intent to sue them, and to allow the companies to avoid the suits by acting quickly. BP, Chevron, KeySpan and Phelps Dodge have been cooperating with state officials to clean up their own properties, according to Robert E. Hernan, an assistant attorney general who heads Mr. Cuomo's environmental enforcement unit. But Exxon Mobil may prove more resistant. According to the notices, the attorney general's office recently approached the company and asked it to take responsibility for stopping continuing leaks at one of two sites it owns. The company declined, the documents state, and Mr. Hernan predicted that it would fight the new action in court. ''Our expectations are not high,'' he said. Correction: February 23, 2007, Friday An article on Feb. 9 about New York State's plans to sue five companies to force them to clean up an oil spill in Brooklyn referred imprecisely to a 1990 agreement to recover the oil reached by one of the companies and state environmental officials. When the company struck the deal, it was known as Mobil -- not Exxon Mobil, which has been its name since a 1999 merger."
"An oil trading company based in the Netherlands has agreed to pay almost $200 million to the government of Ivory Coast to settle claims that it illegally dumped toxic petrochemical waste in Abidjan last August. The company, Trafigura, said the payment was not an admission of fault by any party. It said the money would help pay for a new waste disposal plant, a new hospital and an audit to determine the cause and effects of the dumping. At least 10 people died and thousands more were sickened in Abidjan after hundreds of tons of toxic sludge, pumped from the hold of a ship named the Probo Koala, was dumped at more than a dozen sites, some of them densely populated. About 100,000 people sought medical treatment, swamping the country's health care system, and public outrage at the suspicion that corrupt government officials had allowed the dumping led to the resignation of the entire cabinet, though much of it was later reinstated. In announcing the settlement on Tuesday, Trafigura said in a prepared statement that three of its employees, who had been held since September, had been released. Trafigura had leased the Probo Koala, a Greek-owned tanker flying a Panamanian flag, to transport petrochemical products. It arrived in Amsterdam on July 2, on its way to Estonia, to unload what the company said was 250 tons of ''regular slops,'' wash water from a ship's holds, which is normally laced with oil, gas, caustic soda or other chemicals. But when Amsterdam port workers began pumping out the tanker, they noticed that the liquid was thicker than normal and smelled foul; they refused to finish the job for the agreed-upon price, about $15,000, telling the company that safe disposal in Europe would cost about $300,000. (Trafigura said that with the extra cost of the delays, the amount could have been twice that.) The waste was eventually shipped to West Africa, where it was dumped by an Ivorian company called Tommy for $20,000. An inquiry by the Ivorian government later said that the company might have been created just to dump the waste, and that it had ''neither the qualifications, the competence or the technical ability to treat this waste.'' President Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast described the settlement as a ''a good agreement that will allow the state to compensate the victims,'' according to The Associated Press. But environmental activists said the incident highlighted how toxic waste often ended up on the doorstep of the world's poorest people. Greenpeace called the deal premature and inadequate. ''It does not do justice to the facts because the full liability and the damages have yet to be assessed,'' said Helen Perivier, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace International. She said she feared the government might absolve Trafigura of liability for the waste transport. The incident prompted a number of other investigations. A class action suit on behalf of thousands of victims is before a British court. In the Netherlands, a criminal investigation into the ship's moves while in Amsterdam's port is in progress, a spokesman for the Dutch government said. And there is a criminal investigation under way in Estonia, where the ship loaded cargo and left unhindered. Achim Steiner, director of the United Nations Environment Program, told reporters on Wednesday that the incident had drawn attention to what he called ''a whole unregulated and often illegal trade in toxic hazardous waste. This is not just some minor problem.''"
"From a passing elevated F train, the 11-acre site between Smith Street and the Gowanus Canal known simply as the Public Place looks like any other underused corner of the city, ripe for development. There are a few buildings, including one used by cement company that leases some of the land, but most of the site is an expanse of dried-out brush littered with piles of gravel, rubble and rusty metal. It is what's under the ground that makes the site noteworthy and explains why it has sat dormant since the 1950s. The property, the location of a gas plant long since demolished, is too contaminated for habitation, and though the city has owned most of the property since 1975, the toxic waste has remained largely buried. Slowly, however, changes are coming. In 2003, KeySpan agreed to clean up the site because its predecessor, Brooklyn Union Gas, once owned the factory there. The company has been working with the State Department of Environmental Conservation to study the land, and this month, representatives of both are scheduled to meet with city government officials to discuss cleaning up the land and development options, which include housing, commercial space or a park. The talks, set for Feb. 22 at a meeting of the local community board, will give neighborhood residents a chance to comment. Residents of the surrounding neighborhood are likely to welcome this opportunity to speak out because they have had decades to form opinions. One group, the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation, endorses mixed-use development on the site, while another, Friends and Residents of Greater Gowanus, favors a natural cleanup program that it says would ultimately make the land cleaner than the state's methods, but would preclude residential development for years. ''It's an industrial site,'' said Marlene Donnelly, a member of the latter group. ''Nobody lived there before for a reason. Our question is, is it wise to put people there now?'' But, Rachaele Raynoff, a spokeswoman for the Department of City Planning, one of the agencies with influence over the site's future, said last week that because it is the only publicly owned land in the area, it offers a chance to address issues like affordable housing and public access to the canal. How much cleanup must be done depends in part on what will be built, said Craig Hammerman, the community board's district manager. For example, building housing on the property would require more detoxification than building a park. Still, research on the site and its long, dirty history is continuing. ''There's contamination that's been found to have migrated under the Gowanus Canal all the way over to the east side of the canal,'' Mr. Hammerman said. ''There's contamination 120 feet deep. You're talking about contaminants that have been on this site for 100 years.'' JAKE MOONEY NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: GOWANUS"
"Insurgents are likely to continue combining car bombs with chlorine gas and other chemicals to launch attacks similar to three in recent weeks that spewed chlorine and sickened scores of Iraqis, the military warned Thursday. American troops raided a car-bomb factory near Falluja and found chlorine cylinders and propane tanks among the bomb components. The raid late Tuesday in Karma, an insurgent-dominated village between Falluja and Baghdad, led American officials to suggest that insurgents had planned to combine the materials found into a new round of chemical-laden vehicular bombs. The latest chlorine bombing happened Wednesday in southern Baghdad and killed at least two people and wounded 32 others. Many exhibited symptoms of exposure to chlorine, a greenish gas that burns the skin and can be fatal after a few concentrated, deep breaths. The Karma site was stocked with ''numerous artillery rounds, mortar rounds, bombs, rockets, gutted antiaircraft shells, a pickup truck and three other vehicles that were already in various stages of preparations as car bombs,'' said Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, the second-ranking commander in Iraq. ''We also found ingredients to be used to devise or enhance explosives such as fertilizer and chlorine cylinders,'' the general said. The general insisted that the recent chlorine attacks did not suggest that the insurgency is ''any more capable,'' but said that militants were trying to ''adapt in such ways where they can continue to create instability, and that's what they're doing.'' Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV told CNN that the troops had found ''five complete buildings full of these various types of things,'' including 65 propane tanks. ''What we are seeing is a change in tactics, but the strategy has not changed.'' Military officials are also acutely concerned that insurgents have adapted tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in flight patterns of military helicopters, which are expected to fly 400,000 hours this year in Iraq, a 20 percent increase over 2006. At least eight helicopters have been downed in the last month, the latest on Wednesday when a Black Hawk crash-landed in Diyala Province after coming under fire from heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. No one was wounded in the latest crash. General Odierno said that in two or three of the helicopter shoot downs ''ambush sites'' had been set up by insurgents. ''My guess is we have a cell out there that's somewhat effective,'' he said. He said two suspected of being insurgents, each believed to have played a role in separate helicopter attacks, had been detained in the past week, and one had admitted his involvement. In Ramadi, the Anbar provincial capital, American forces fought a fierce battle with insurgents that officials at the Ramadi hospital said had left at least 27 Iraqis dead. One of the officials, Dr. Abdullah Salah, said four women and four children were among those killed. Witnesses said at least three houses had been attacked by American aircraft. The marines, who patrol western Iraq, disputed the hospital casualty count, saying that the six-hour fight left 12 insurgents dead and that they had no reports of civilian or American military casualties. A Marine spokesman, First Lt. Shawn Mercer, said insurgents attacked soldiers with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades Wednesday evening in east Ramadi. The American soldiers fired back at first with small arms and medium machine guns, then with heavy machine guns, a shoulder-fired rocket, and ''precision guided munitions.'' The Associated Press reported that photographs made available to the news agency showed ''the bodies of two small boys wrapped in one blanket, one with a bloody face, the other ashen and with mud on his mouth, his hands crossed on his chest.'' Other pictures showed four or five bodies covered by blankets, and men searching through rubble. On the heels of another rape allegation that has shaken Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, an Iraqi general in the northern city of Tal Afar told several news agencies that four Iraqi soldiers had been accused of raping a 50-year-old Sunni Turkmen woman about 10 days ago. Brig. Gen. Nijm Abdullah told The Associated Press that a lieutenant and three enlisted men initially denied the woman's charge, but then confessed after being confronted by the woman. An official from the Tal Afar hospital said the woman was raped after her husband was jailed by Iraqi soldiers, and she did not come forward until she was encouraged to do so by an official from the main Sunni political bloc. One soldier from the 13th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) was killed and three wounded by a roadside bomb attack near Diwaniya early Thursday morning, the military reported. At least 14 bodies were also discovered throughout the capital on Thursday, an Interior Ministry official said. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ"
"A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rebuked the Environmental Protection Agency in a decision Tuesday, indicating that the regulators had flouted Congress and the courts in setting the standards governing hazardous air pollution emissions from plants making bricks and ceramics. The panel concurred in a single opinion that the agency had ignored a federal appeals court opinion directing it to follow the Clean Air Act's instructions in setting emission standards for kilns making bricks and ceramics. These kilns collectively emit more than 6,440 tons of toxic acids and small soot, which can cause breathing difficulties, organ damage and cancer. The ruling said the agency had ignored the court's order to ensure that the basis for its standards was emission levels achieved by kilns using the most effective technology currently in use in the industry. ''If the Environmental Protection Agency disagrees with the Clean Air Act's requirements for setting emission standards it should take its concerns to Congress,'' the judges wrote in an unusually pointed final paragraph. ''If the E.P.A. disagrees with this court's interpretation of the Clean Air Act,'' they continued, the agency should appeal its earlier ruling. ''In the meantime, it must obey the Clean Air Act as written by Congress and interpreted by this court.'' In a statement on the Web site of Earthjustice, the organization that represented the Sierra Club in its suit against the E.P.A. over the standards, James Pew, a lawyer, said: ''This decision is not just about brick kilns. It is about an agency that thinks it is above the law, and chooses to ignore Congress, the courts and the citizens who have called upon E.P.A. to protect against this pollution.'' Jessica L. Edmond, the agency's deputy press secretary, released a statement saying that ''E.P.A.'s innovative strategies to improve air quality are achieving real results,'' adding that the disputed rules were reducing toxic air pollutants by approximately 2,300 tons a year. Ms. Edmond said the Bush administration would review the ruling before deciding whether to appeal it."
"IN the golden days of the poisoner -- most of the 19th century, in fact -- the metallic poison arsenic earned an apt nickname: ''succession powder.'' Children impatient to inherit their parents' estates, wives eager to lose their elderly husbands, found arsenic a terrific way to speed their hopes along. Thanks in large part to improved detection techniques, however, murder by poison has become quite rare: the Georgia woman who was convicted last week, for the second time, of killing a husband by lacing his meals with antifreeze is very much the exception. Still, it was no surprise that as soon as the recent dog and cat deaths in North America were traced to a rat poison in pet food, the question of sabotage arose immediately: ''Was Pet Food Deliberately Poisoned?'' read the headline in one Canadian newspaper. Whenever deaths involve chemical causes, people immediately speculate about a shadowy poisoner at work. The drug overdose of Anna Nicole Smith is only the latest to make headlines, along with the efforts by the family of Harry Houdini to exhume his body to answer persistent rumors that the magician was fatally poisoned by rivals in 1926. (This last episode seems particularly quixotic, as it is far easier to identify a poison than a poisoner; we may safely assume that finding poison in Houdini's body will not suddenly reveal the name of a long-hidden murderer.) And while the investigation into the pet food poisonings so far discounts murderous intent, it's obvious from Internet chat room discussions that many people don't accept the innocent explanation. One particularly vengeful cat owner posted a recommendation that the ''nutcase'' in question be fed a large, and presumably lethal, meal of ''Special Kitty'' brand cat food. Much as I appreciate an appropriate punishment -- and the fascination of an elusive pet-hating psychopath -- I suspect that blaming a lone killer is far too easy an answer. Instead, this latest encounter with contaminated food leads to a more complicated, and less comfortable, sense of the poisoners among us. According to scientists at Cornell University, the cause of the pet deaths -- fewer than 20 have been formally reported, although more than 1,000 have been self-reported on the Internet -- was lethal levels of aminopterin in the food. Aminopterin is an enzyme inhibitor; it blocks normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids. It's able to interfere with genetic processes, reproductive abilities and metabolic functions, making it useful in a limited way, and dangerous in a complete one. In the United States, aminopterin is licensed only for medical research like cancer treatment. In China and other Asian countries, it has been used as a rat poison, usually to keep stored grain from becoming infested. As it turns out, the producer of the tainted products, Menu Foods, recently switched to a Chinese supplier of wheat gluten, which is used to thicken gravy-style pet food. It's too early to know for certain, but it seems very likely that tainted gluten slipped past quality inspections because aminopterin is not included in routine toxicity screens. Investigators also emphasize that the poisoned food came from two manufacturing plants, separated by a good thousand miles, which would require an extremely energetic saboteur. Does that rule out the possibility of a deliberate poisoning? No. But I worry that the conspiracy theorists, those who persist in believing that poor, sad Anna Nicole Smith was murdered or that a crazy animal hater is automatically responsible for tainted food, divert us from the probable cause and the more serious issue. Pesticide contamination, not just in China but globally, occurs because we operate, deliberately, in a world of poisons. We kill lots of animals -- the ones we find annoying, destructive or unsafe. We regularly employ toxic substances against rats, insects, prairie dogs, coyotes and invasive fish, and yet we are shocked when those same lethal substances affect us. We've been learning and forgetting this lesson almost since we began using industrial pesticides: in 1959, American consumers spun into panic upon learning that their Thanksgiving cranberries were contaminated with the weed killer aminotriazole; in 1962, Rachel Carson published her exposé on the wildlife deaths caused by the pesticide DDT; in 1984, consumers nationwide threw away their pancake mixes after learning they contained trace levels of a grain fumigant; in 1989, consumers were horrified after the pesticide Alar was discovered on apples in grocery stores. While cases of acute toxicity are rare, accumulated research studies show that chronic pesticide exposure, not surprisingly, is less than healthy. In 2003, for instance, a federal study reported that a high level of exposure to agricultural pesticides raised the risks of some birth defects by 65 percent and increased the likelihood of a variety of diseases ranging from cancer to Parkinson's. Suburban lawn chemicals have been associated with increased cancer risks in both people and domestic pets. So I don't think we have to look too far for the poisoners in this round of pet deaths. We lean toward the saboteur and the murderous poisoner because they've always lived among us, and because they make excellent scapegoats. But we're all poisoners in our way -- purchasers of roach sprays, consumers of perfect produce delivered by grace of dangerous chemicals. Every so often, we are forced to realize that, like the arsenic poisoners of old, our lifestyle also demands innocent victims. Op-Ed Contributor Deborah Blum, a professor of science journalism at the University of Wisconsin, is writing a book about poison murders of the early 20th century."
"A damaged and listing cargo ship was spilling fuel and cargo containers into stormy seas off the southwest coast of England, near Devon, British officials said Sunday night. Some of the containers held hazardous materials. An estimated 150 to 200 containers have slipped off the deck of the heavily damaged ship, the Napoli, which was listing severely, Paul Coley, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said at a news conference. Some of the containers have already washed up at local beaches, officials said. The police closed some beaches and warned residents not to approach any of the containers, although the coast guard agency said that it believed that only two of those washed overboard contained hazardous substances, like nitric acid. In addition, the boat's hull developed a crack at some point while it was being towed to shore and since Sunday night has been spilling heavy diesel fuel oil into the sea, presumably from its engines. It was not clear how much fuel oil had spilled into local waters, although there were reports of a few sea birds covered in oil. The leaks are extremely threatening because the vessel is near a sensitive ecological area, the estuary of the Axe River, an area known for wildlife and salmon breeding, Mike Dunning, a spokesman for the Environment Agency in Southwest England, said in a phone interview. The British authorities have deployed a boom over the mouth of the river as a precaution to prevent any oil from washing in to it. The Napoli was damaged and its crew of 26 was evacuated about 40 miles off the British coast on Thursday after a severe storm, with seas of 40 feet and winds of 70 miles an hour. British officials decided to tow the vessel nearer to land and to ground it to prevent it from sinking. Recurrent gale force winds and high seas near the coast on Sunday caused the boat to list, allowing containers piled four-high on its deck to fall into the sea perilously close to land, Mr. Dunning said. ''The salvage plan concerns the oils that we deem at this present moment to be the greater threat,'' Robin Middleton, a salvage adviser to the coast guard agency, said at a news conference Sunday. The ship's tanks hold 3,000 tons of diesel and fuel oil but British officials said Sunday that only one tank, holding 200 tons, appeared to be damaged. Salvage teams were working to stabilize the ship, which was listing at a 30-degree angle. A tanker was expected to arrive Monday to begin pumping the remaining oil off the Napoli, officials said, and remaining containers would be unloaded. The vessel was carrying 2,323 containers, 158 of which were classed as hazardous, according to the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code. Dangerous materials in containers on board included nitric oxide and potassium hydroxide, battery acid and chemicals used to make perfume."
"More than 750,000 port workers will be required to have criminal background and immigration checks in an antiterrorism program that the Homeland Security Department announced on Wednesday, and industry leaders say the effort could disrupt port traffic nationally. Since shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, work has been under way on a tamperproof card, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, that workers will receive after passing the reviews. The Homeland Security Department this week issued 469 pages of final rules for the program, which is intended to make it harder for terrorists to sneak into secure port areas. Starting in March, workers like longshoremen and truck drivers will have to apply for the card, which will include a fingerprint and a digital photograph. The applicants will have to prove that they are legally working in the United States. They also cannot have been convicted of any terrorism-related crimes like spying, sedition or treason, as well as other charges like murder, improper transport of hazardous materials or illegal possession or purchase of explosives. Anyone convicted in the past seven years of a much longer list of crimes like possession of illegal firearms, bribery, arson, robbery or extortion will have to seek a waiver before obtaining a card. People involuntarily committed to mental health centers because of drug or alcohol addiction will have to prove that they have successfully completed rehabilitation. Industry officials say the restrictions may disqualify thousands of workers, particularly truck drivers, based on estimates that a signification segment of the drivers may be working here illegally. Union leaders have said workers with criminal records who have served their time or paid fines might lose their jobs. ''We don't want to keep people who are not a terrorist risk to be kept from doing their job,'' said Steve Stallone, a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Kip Hawley, assistant secretary of the Transportation Security Administration, said in an interview Wednesday that he was confident that the effects would be modest. Drivers of trucks carrying hazardous materials have similar background checks, with 1 percent disqualified, Mr. Hawley said. ''We do not anticipate this will be a huge issue,'' he added. The government has expanded the appeals process so workers with criminal histories can present their cases to an administrative law judge. The cards will first be issued at a few ports and then expand over 18 months until they cover the nation's estimated 770,000 maritime workers. Applicants will have to pay up to $159 for the card, which will be good for five years. Over all, the government estimates that the program will cost $1.8 billion over the next decade, factoring in related costs like paying escorts required for people without cards who need to enter secure port areas."
"A CSX freight train carrying chemical cargo derailed and ignited south of Louisville, Ky., yesterday, forcing the evacuation of homes, shutting down roads and sending students home from school, Kentucky emergency officials said. There were no reported injuries, the officials said. More than a quarter of the cars on the 80-car train derailed in Brooks, Ky., about 15 miles short of its Louisville destination, just before 9 a.m. Officials had not determined a cause of the accident. Fire broke out in 14 cars, sending billowing plumes of smoke into the air. Officials closed about 20 miles of Interstate 65 and restricted airspace over the fire, said Yvette Smith, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management. The state ordered the evacuation of all homes within a one mile of the accident and asked all residents of Bullitt County to stay inside, shut their windows and take pets inside, Ms. Smith said. The state fire marshal, Rodney Raby, said in a news conference televised nationally that there had been some anxious moments over the possibility of explosions, but that by midday, the incident was ''winding down successfully.'' The fire was still burning last night, but officials said Interstate 65 had been reopened. The chemical cyclohexane, which is a highly flammable chemical and an eye and skin irritant, may have fueled the fire, said Maj. Lisa Rudzinski of the state police. At least one train car also contained the chemical butadiene, which is hazardous if inhaled, but it was not clear whether that car had ruptured, Major Rudzinski said. A CSX spokesman, Gary Sease, said one train car contained ethyl methyl ketone, a flammable solvent, two others contained maleic anhydride, a corrosive material used to make resins, and two others carried alcohol. Mr. Sease said the railroad was obligated to carry hazardous substances for its customers. ''Knowing the sensitivity and safety concerns around hazardous materials, we work very hard to make sure that those hazardous materials are transported safely,'' he said. Fifteen members of the National Guard were dispatched to help in detecting chemicals and other hazardous materials, Major Rudzinski said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending investigators, and its chairman, Mark V. Rosenker, to the scene. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sent an environmental health scientist to Brooks to assess public health risks, said an agency spokesman, John Florence. Bullitt County school officials moved Brooks Elementary School to another school because of a concern that the fire might snarl bus routes, not because of danger to the children, said a school spokesman, John Roberts. Jack Roberts, administrator of the private Micah Christian Academy, said that he could see smoke from the wreck site, which he estimated to be about two miles away, and that the smoke left an unpleasant burning sensation in the mouth. He closed the school as a precaution. ''They say that it's not dangerous, other than maybe to folks who have breathing problems, but we're close enough to where we feel like it's necessary that we close,'' Mr. Roberts said. Next month, the Department of Homeland Security will hold public hearings on its proposal to require railroads to continuously track tanker cars carrying chemicals that are ''toxic inhalation hazards,'' and bar them from leaving the cars parked or unattended for long periods. Coincidentally, the Federal Railroad Administration announced yesterday that it was cooperating with Dow Chemical Company, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Union Tank Car Company to develop a ''next generation'' rail tank car. The car would be designed to resist puncture in accidents or terrorist attacks. Joseph H. Boardman, the agency administrator, said he hoped to issue a final rule for the cars early next year. Mr. Boardman would not say when current cars would be replaced, but he said cars used for the most hazardous materials would be replaced first."
"NOW that the mystery smells of Manhattan have abated, are you still wondering whether the Grim Reaper's cologne will smell like maple syrup or rotten eggs when he comes for you? Don't worry, because here's the thing: the more powerful the stench, the less likely it is to do harm. Indeed, the smell that's typically associated with natural gas is deliberately put in to warn you of its otherwise odorless presence -- you'll call Con Edison before it all goes bang. In this case, it is not the thing that smells that will harm you, but the thing that doesn't smell. As a kind of perverse perfumery, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company offers 24 different compositions of sulfur compounds as part of its Scentinel line of gas odorants. A few well-dispersed ounces of Scentinel A, which is made of ethyl mercaptan, the odorant added to natural gas, are enough to stink up all of Manhattan, but by themselves, they won't blow anything up. So why do we find the sulfur smell by itself so objectionable? One hundred years ago, the most feared smells were those of putrefaction, which were thought to carry disease. These days, the chain of cold that takes perishables from fridge to fridge has all but eliminated smells of rot -- though many people still use the expression ''rotten egg smell,'' few have ever encountered it. Instead, what we fear today when we smell sulfur is the possibility that manufactured poisons are present. In response to the widespread suspicion of smells, industry goes to great lengths to avoid generating them, and government agencies pay employees to scour the countryside to identify reported malodors. Nowadays, even huge fragrance plants like Symrise's, which bestrides the bucolic town of Holzminden in central Germany, can be virtually odorless, thanks to better technology. They have to be or they would have been kicked out of town. If, in Lord Palmerston's famous phrase, dirt is ''matter in the wrong place,'' then a stink is a scent in the wrong space. We worry about what we feel and can't see. We want smell to be predictable, to lead us to the object that produces it, and to stay reasonably close to its origin on a leash no more than a few yards long. Anything that reeks beyond a city block is an invisible snarling dog with unknown intentions, even if, in the right context, the smell itself would be innocuous. Therefore, people complain. Yet some of the most dangerous things have no smell at all and generate no complaints. Consider that on a desolate and beautiful stretch of beach near Hartlepool, England, sits a factory that manufactures the smelliest flavors, those that make the instant noodle soup in the office microwave smell of leeks two floors down. Next to it is a nuclear power station. When the wind is from the northeast, the guys producing nuclear waste phone to complain about the smell of noodle soup. Yet there do appear to be two smells that are bad in any context: ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, respectively rotten fish and rotten eggs. Both are products of the decay of proteins, and any early human unable to smell them would have soon died, probably from food poisoning. The wiring of our sense of smell evolved millions of years ago in days when all molecules were ''organic'' in the New Age use of the word, meaning natural. During the last 200 years, proper organic, meaning carbon-based, chemistry has made more than eight million new compounds never seen before on earth. A majority of these compounds turns out to be nontoxic; a minority of them smell. In this great molecular crowd, the chemicals that are both volatile enough to inhale and highly toxic are remarkably sparse. The intensely smelly hydrogen sulfide, the pleasant almond-scented hydrogen cyanide and the totally odorless carbon monoxide all kill you in a similar way. They attach to the iron in your cells and dethrone another small, odorless fellow we rely upon to live: oxygen. Very few people ever die of hydrogen sulfide poisoning because, like the stuff in natural gas, it has such a strong and unpleasant odor that you will run for your life long before it can do any harm. Cyanide too, as long as you recognize you are not smelling amaretto, will give you time to get out. Carbon monoxide, because it doesn't smell, is much more dangerous. Then there are gases used in warfare that are deliberately designed by man to kill. Mario Sartori's textbook on such gases, published in 1939, describes in terrifying detail the properties of many of these chemical Furies, which sometimes even smelled good. Phosgene, responsible for permanently crippling so many World War I soldiers, is described as having a smell reminiscent of hay; while dichlorodiethyl sulfide or Yperite (named after the Belgian city Ypres, where it was first used) is said to smell like mustard. Some of the worst, like sarin, have no smell at all. So relax if you can, and remember that a widespread stench with no obvious source means a powerfully smelly molecule is in the air. If so, a little goes a long way, and a little can do no harm.

"IT is hard enough to regulate something when you know what it is, what it does, how it works and who is actually making it. Nabil Al-Hadithy had none of those advantages when he began to consider what -- if anything --Berkeley, Calif., wanted to do about regulating nanotechnology. That issue became a concern for Mr. Al-Hadithy, the city's hazardous waste manager, when a federal research laboratory affiliated with the University of California filed an environmental impact statement three years ago for its latest building project -- a ''molecular foundry'' to make nanoparticles. ''We sent them a bunch of questions, starting with: 'What the heck is a nanoparticle?' '' Mr. Al-Hadithy said. It turns out to be a deceptively complicated question, but that did not stop Mr. Al-Hadithy from coming up with his own answer. When the city council adopted his regulation last month, Berkeley became the first government body in the United States -- and possibly anywhere, according to some analysts -- to explicitly regulate businesses that make or use nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are generally defined as clusters of atoms and molecules used in a rapidly growing range of invisible products and microscopic manufacturing processes measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter. The largest particle subject to Mr. Al-Hadithy's regulation is roughly 800 times thinner than a human hair. For now, nanotechnology is limited to somewhat mundane applications, including stain-resistant clothing, transparent cosmetics and antimicrobial surfaces for medical and household products. Promoters, however, have not been shy about predicting how nanotechnology might transform everything from health care to energy production. But when the same folks talk to health and environmental regulators, those promises tend to be replaced with soothing assurances that there is no reason -- at least not yet -- to presume that nanotechnology is unusual enough to present unique regulatory concerns. That seeming contradiction did not go over well in Berkeley, which has long been skeptical about the marketplace's ability to anticipate disaster. Hence the new regulation that requires businesses to annually identify for Mr. Al-Hadithy's office any materials they use or produce with at least one dimension of 100 nanometers or less, no matter how small the quantities. They must also share what they know about how toxic the particles might be and describe procedures for tracking, handling and disposing of them. Unlike most definitions of nanoparticles, Berkeley's has no lower size limit and so presumably covers individual atoms a fraction of a nanometer in diameter if they have been ionized -- that is, given positive or negative charges. It would be a stretch to call the new ordinance a home run for critics of nanotechnology. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California are exempt, although the lab said it planned to voluntarily supply any relevant data it gathers as a byproduct of its research. Mr. Al-Hadithy said he had no reason so far to believe that any business in Berkeley actually made or used nanoparticles. None has stepped forward, anyway. But he said he hoped that Berkeley's move would draw attention to animal studies suggesting ways that at least some nanoparticles might harm the lungs or brain and would influence regulators elsewhere to seek more information. Federal and state regulators, like their counterparts overseas, have so far been happy to sponsor meetings and studies that call for regulation but notably reluctant to engage in any. A very small fraction of the billions of dollars being invested in nanotechnology research is being used to ferret out potential risks. ''Governments are scared of regulating nanotechnology out of fear of losing the benefits,'' Mr. Al-Hadithy said. Those in the industry, like Dennis Schneider, director of marketing and sales for NanoHorizons, a nanotech startup in State College, Pa., say there is a more straightforward explanation for the inactivity: the nanoparticles now being used are made in such small volume and are so bound up in other material that people are not exposed to quantities worth regulating. ''You can't pump them or blow them,'' said Mr. Schneider of his company's products. ''You have to bind them to something and drag them around, then change the binding forces to put them somewhere. Or grow them where they are going to be used.'' When regulators encounter nanotechnology, they have tended to apply existing laws to new products in ways that can seem odd at first glance. In November, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency said it would classify Samsung's SilverCare line of washing machines as a pesticide because the machines ionize silver atoms and add them to the wash -- 100 quadrillion per load, Samsung says -- to kill bacteria and viruses. While some would argue that the ions are too small to qualify as nanotechnology, the logic of the E.P.A. ruling would appear to apply to a wide range of nanotechnology-based antimicrobial products that have been advertised this year, including A.R.C. Outdoor's E47 underwear, Sharper Image's line of ''FresherLonger Miracle Food Storage Containers'' and Motorola's i870 cellphone. The E.P.A. said that its ruling had nothing to do with particle size and will be clarified in an official publication this month. Of course, the way to avoid any dealings with the E.P.A. on the subject under the current pesticide law is to simply stop making the antimicrobial claim. Sharper Image has already done just that without changing the containers or other products with silver particles. Such loopholes underscore the need for tighter regulation and public-private partnerships to more thoroughly study potential hazards, according to the critics. ''We don't know enough to wield a hammer on anything,'' said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. Berkeley Legal"
"President Bush has signed a directive that gives the White House much greater control over the rules and policy statements that the government develops to protect public health, safety, the environment, civil rights and privacy. In an executive order published last week in the Federal Register, Mr. Bush said that each agency must have a regulatory policy office run by a political appointee, to supervise the development of rules and documents providing guidance to regulated industries. The White House will thus have a gatekeeper in each agency to analyze the costs and the benefits of new rules and to make sure the agencies carry out the president's priorities. This strengthens the hand of the White House in shaping rules that have, in the past, often been generated by civil servants and scientific experts. It suggests that the administration still has ways to exert its power after the takeover of Congress by the Democrats. The White House said the executive order was not meant to rein in any one agency. But business executives and consumer advocates said the administration was particularly concerned about rules and guidance issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In an interview on Monday, Jeffrey A. Rosen, general counsel at the White House Office of Management and Budget, said, ''This is a classic good-government measure that will make federal agencies more open and accountable.'' Business groups welcomed the executive order, saying it had the potential to reduce what they saw as the burden of federal regulations. This burden is of great concern to many groups, including small businesses, that have given strong political and financial backing to Mr. Bush. Consumer, labor and environmental groups denounced the executive order, saying it gave too much control to the White House and would hinder agencies' efforts to protect the public. Typically, agencies issue regulations under authority granted to them in laws enacted by Congress. In many cases, the statute does not say precisely what agencies should do, giving them considerable latitude in interpreting the law and developing regulations. The directive issued by Mr. Bush says that, in deciding whether to issue regulations, federal agencies must identify ''the specific market failure'' or problem that justifies government intervention. Besides placing political appointees in charge of rule making, Mr. Bush said agencies must give the White House an opportunity to review ''any significant guidance documents'' before they are issued. The Office of Management and Budget already has an elaborate process for the review of proposed rules. But in recent years, many agencies have circumvented this process by issuing guidance documents, which explain how they will enforce federal laws and contractual requirements. Peter L. Strauss, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the executive order ''achieves a major increase in White House control over domestic government.'' ''Having lost control of Congress,'' Mr. Strauss said, ''the president is doing what he can to increase his control of the executive branch.'' Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said: ''The executive order allows the political staff at the White House to dictate decisions on health and safety issues, even if the government's own impartial experts disagree. This is a terrible way to govern, but great news for special interests.'' Business groups hailed the initiative. ''This is the most serious attempt by any chief executive to get control over the regulatory process, which spews out thousands of regulations a year,'' said William L. Kovacs, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''Because of the executive order, regulations will be less onerous and more reasonable. Federal officials will have to pay more attention to the costs imposed on business, state and local governments, and society.'' Under the executive order, each federal agency must estimate ''the combined aggregate costs and benefits of all its regulations'' each year. Until now, agencies often tallied the costs and the benefits of major rules one by one, without measuring the cumulative effects. Gary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a liberal-leaning consumer group that monitors the Office of Management and Budget, criticized Mr. Bush's order, saying, ''It will result in more delay and more White House control over the day-to-day work of federal agencies.'' ''By requiring agencies to show a 'market failure,' '' Dr. Bass said, ''President Bush has created another hurdle for agencies to clear before they can issue rules protecting public health and safety.'' Wesley P. Warren, program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who worked at the White House for seven years under President Bill Clinton, said, ''The executive order is a backdoor attempt to prevent E.P.A. from being able to enforce environmental safeguards that keep cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants out of the air and water.'' Business groups have complained about the proliferation of guidance documents. David W. Beier, a senior vice president of Amgen, the biotechnology company, said Medicare officials had issued such documents ''with little or no public input.'' Hugh M. O'Neill, a vice president of the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, said guidance documents sometimes undermined or negated the effects of formal regulations. In theory, guidance documents do not have the force of law. But the White House said the documents needed closer scrutiny because they ''can have coercive effects'' and ''can impose significant costs'' on the public. Many guidance documents are made available to regulated industries but not to the public. Paul R. Noe, who worked on regulatory policy at the White House from 2001 to 2006, said such aberrations would soon end. ''In the past, guidance documents were often issued in the dark,'' Mr. Noe said. ''The executive order will ensure they are issued in the sunshine, with more opportunity for public comment.'' Under the new White House policy, any guidance document expected to have an economic effect of $100 million a year or more must be posted on the Internet, and agencies must invite public comment, except in emergencies in which the White House grants an exemption. The White House told agencies that in writing guidance documents, they could not impose new legal obligations on anyone and could not use ''mandatory language such as 'shall,' 'must,' 'required' or 'requirement.' '' The executive order was issued as White House aides were preparing for a battle over the nomination of Susan E. Dudley to be administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget. President Bush first nominated Ms. Dudley last August. The nomination died in the Senate, under a barrage of criticism from environmental and consumer groups, which said she had been hostile to government regulation. Mr. Bush nominated her again on Jan. 9. With Democrats in control, the Senate appears unlikely to confirm Ms. Dudley. But under the Constitution, the president could appoint her while the Senate is in recess, allowing her to serve through next year. Some of Ms. Dudley's views are reflected in the executive order. In a primer on regulation written in 2005, while she was at the Mercatus Center of George MasonUniversity in Northern Virginia, Ms. Dudley said that government regulation was generally not warranted ''in the absence of a significant market failure.'' She did not return calls seeking comment on Monday."
"A search by the city of its files concerning Cesar A. Borja, the New York City police officer whose death from lung disease was held up as an example of the medical problems affecting thousands of ground zero workers and volunteers, found no record that he worked in Lower Manhattan until Dec. 24, 2001, more than three months after the 9/11 attack. The records show that Officer Borja worked for several hours in Brooklyn, near the East River waterfront, on the evening of Sept. 13, 2001, two days after the disaster, during his regular work shift. Officer Borja, 52, died on Jan. 23 this year, hours before his eldest child, Ceasar, attended the State of the Union address to publicize the plight of workers who responded to the World Trade Center attack. The officer had received a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, a rare chronic lung disease that his family believes was caused by exposure to toxic substances in Lower Manhattan. Several news organizations reported that Officer Borja had rushed to ground zero after the twin towers fell, but The New York Times reported on Feb. 13 that according to the officer's own records, he did not work a formal shift in Lower Manhattan until Dec. 24, 2001. By then, much of the site had been cleared and the fire in the remaining pile had been declared extinguished. Yesterday, the city's Law Department released 55 pages of records concerning Officer Borja, in response to requests by The Times and other news organizations under the state's Freedom of Information Law. Among the documents that had not been previously released were eight pages from a handwritten command log maintained at the police tow pound in College Point, Queens, where Officer Borja was assigned. The command log lists Officer Borja as one of five officers from the pound who worked at Adams and Plymouth Streets, at the Brooklyn end of the Manhattan Bridge, from 6:50 p.m. to 11 p.m., during his regular work hours on Sept. 13, 2001. In a February interview, Officer Borja's wife, Eva, recalled that her husband had said he worked in Brooklyn shortly after the attack. The family has not maintained that he worked at ground zero before December 2001. The records released yesterday also include a table listing Officer Borja's overtime claims from Sept. 11, 2001, to April 28, 2002. Each entry is given a four-digit code according to the type of overtime claimed. According to the table, Officer Borja did not claim paid overtime for work outside the borough to which he was assigned -- Queens -- until Dec. 24, 2001. Both the log and the table note that Officer Borja repeatedly filed for World Trade Center-related overtime, but there is no indication that the overtime was for work at ground zero. The attack had put the city, state and federal governments on high alert, and almost the entire Police Department was mobilized for extra duty for weeks after the disaster. The records also include three weeks of roll-call records. The roll calls show Officer Borja working his regular shift, 2:37 to 11 p.m., on Sept. 11, 2001; a different shift, 6 p.m. to 2:23 a.m., on the three following days; and a 12-hour shift, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Sept. 15, a Saturday, which was one of his regular days off. According to the roll calls, Officer Borja took the next week off for vacation before returning to his regular schedule on Sept. 24. The city also released 16 assignment sheets yesterday showing that Officer Borja did shifts as part of a ''World Trade Center recovery detail'' around ground zero between Dec. 24, 2001, and April 27, 2002. The records show that Officer Borja was one of 35,006 police employees who submitted their names to an ''exposure database'' created by the Police Department's medical division. But officials said the database did not indicate where the employees were stationed on the day of the attack. Ceasar Borja, the officer's son, declined to comment yesterday on the newly released records. The officer's widow, Eva, did not respond to a phone message left at her home."
"IN 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency took its first important step toward reducing mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. Its Clear Air Mercury Rule is intended to bring about a 70 percent reduction in mercury emissions over the next 20 years. But the new rule does not require all plants to reduce emissions by the same amount. Some may be allowed to pollute more than others by buying pollution credits from other plants. The E.P.A.'s faith in this ''cap and trade'' approach is based on the assumption that mercury pollution disperses evenly in the environment. This strategy has worked well in reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain. But mercury does not behave in the same way as acid rain. In fact, much of the mercury emitted by coal-fired power plants remains near those plants. In a just completed 10-year study of birds, fish and mammals in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, we found five places where fish and wildlife have exceptionally high concentrations of mercury in their blood. Under the E.P.A.'s new rule, these biological mercury ''hot spots'' could persist, with dangerous consequences for the health of people and wildlife. For more than a century, mercury pollution has blanketed much of the United States. Coal-fired power plants and other sources emit mercury into the atmosphere, where it is carried with the wind and deposited onto the ground. On land, particularly in wetlands, mercury can change to a form known as methyl mercury, which readily accumulates in organisms. Methyl mercury is taken up by microscopic plants and animals, which are then consumed by fish and other animals. As it moves up the food chain, methyl mercury increases in concentration as much as 10 million times. Animals at the top of the chain that consume lots of tainted fish -- common loons, bald eagles, river otters and some humans -- are exposed to methyl mercury in amounts high enough to cause neurological damage, behavioral abnormalities and reproductive problems. Children are particularly at risk for mercury poisoning. Some 200,000 to 400,000 children born in the United States each year have been exposed to mercury levels in their mothers' wombs high enough to impair neurological development, according to an analysis of data gathered from 1999-2002 by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. To reduce this exposure, the E.P.A. must monitor, and work to eliminate, mercury hot spots. Within one hot spot we found in western Maine, 43 percent of the adult loons had blood mercury levels higher than 3.0 parts per million -- three times as much as loons tested from remote Alaskan lakes, and high enough to be poisonous. One loon had a blood mercury level of 14.2 parts per million and showed visible signs of poisoning, including an inability to dive and evade approaching boats. In southern New Hampshire, in an area downwind of several coal-fired power plants, mercury deposition is nearly five times higher than E.P.A. estimates. Environmental protection officials in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and several other states have adopted state emissions plans that prohibit trading of mercury pollution credits. The E.P.A. should likewise consider the real danger of biological mercury hot spots. At the same time, the agency should create a national mercury monitoring network to track how well its emissions limits are working. (A bill that would establish such a network is before Congress now.) This approach is the only way the agency can evaluate the need for steeper and faster reductions in mercury emissions, track how well its emissions limits alleviate hot spots and ultimately protect the environment and human health.

"Shaken and Sorted On the Surface Of an Asteroid While it has been rolling its way through the solar system, the near-Earth asteroid Itokawa has been shaking, too. That's the conclusion of Hideaki Miyamoto of the University of Tokyo and colleagues, who see evidence of vibrations at work in images of the asteroid's gravel-strewn surface. The close-up images were taken in 2005 by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa as it hovered over and touched down briefly on the 1,000-foot asteroid in a sample-return mission. The images show the kinds of gravel migration, alignment and sorting that can be caused by shaking, and are often seen on Earth along riverbeds or after landslides. On Itokawa, the researchers showed, the rubble tends to migrate toward several low areas that are filled with fine-grained material. The findings are reported online by the journal Science. What might be causing the shaking? Itokawa is so tiny, with so little gravity, that the impact of even a small meteoroid, on the order of a half-inch in diameter, would be enough to cause seismic convulsions. Among other possibilities, the researchers say, are gravitational ''tides,'' caused by the tug of planets as the asteroid rolls along. That New Car Bouquet Is Intoxicating, Not Toxic Do you love the smell of a new car? Ever wondered what the heady mix of aldehydes, ketones and other volatile organic compounds from the dashboard and other interior components might be doing to you? The answer, at least in terms of allergic reactions, is not much, according to a study by Jeroen T. M. Buters of the Technical University of Munich and colleagues in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. The researchers looked at the toxicity of the air in cars that were exposed to simulated sunlight, heating the interiors to about 150 degrees Fahrenheit, or the equivalent of leaving a car parked in the sun. They tested two identical cars, one about a month old and the other three years old. The air in both cars contained many compounds, with different mixes between new and old. (Dr. Buters pointed out that many of these compounds have no odor at all and that many of those responsible for ''new-car smell'' are present only in small concentrations.) Tests on cell cultures showed no Type 4 allergic reactions like contact dermatitis, and tests of Type 1 reactions like those to pollen or dust mites showed just that new-car air might worsen allergies in people who already have them. ''There is something there, but it's slight,'' Dr. Buters said. But realistically, when people enter a hot car, the first thing they do is open the windows. So Dr. Buters said health effects, if any, probably had more to do with other vehicles' exhaust entering the car. ''Our paper indicates it's not so much from the inside,'' he said. Finding Crown Solves Puzzle In Paleobotany About 130 years ago, workers in a quarry in upstate New York discovered a group of fossilized stumps, the remnants of an ancient stand of trees that was preserved in place in the late Devonian Period, about 385 million years ago. Called Eospermatopteris (but more commonly known as the Gilboa stumps, after the town in Schoharie County where they were found), they have puzzled paleobotanists ever since. ''They have been widely cited as the world's oldest forest,'' said William E. Stein, a paleobotanist at Binghamton University. ''The only problem is no one knew what they were.'' They were, after all, just stumps, with no sign of what their crowns looked like. But that has now changed, thanks to painstaking work by Linda VanAller Hernick and Frank Mannolini of the New York State Museum in Albany. At another Schoharie County quarry, the two discovered fossils of a tree crown and a long trunk that they, Dr. Stein and others have identified as the same species as the Gilboa stumps. The complete Eospermatopteris, as described in a paper in the journal Nature and reconstructed in the line drawing here, grew up to 25 feet or more, with shallow roots and a flared crown that consisted of flattened frondlike branches with tiny branchlets at the tips. ''More or less like a bottle brush,'' Dr. Stein said. The discovery pushes another fossil plant, Archaeopteris, out of its position as the oldest known tree. Archaeopteris, a distant ancestor of current seed plants, had a more modern architecture, with long-lived branches along the trunk that sprouted leafy twigs. ''There's these two important morphologies,'' Dr. Stein said. ''Of the two, Eospermatopteris is in fact an older version.'' Knowing what Eospermatopteris looked like, he said, ''we can begin to visualize what these forests were like.'' For one thing, they wouldn't have been very dark, because the branchlets don't block much light. And with all the litter the trees produced, dropping branches as the trunk grew, the forests could have supported a vast community of arthropods. But solving the puzzle of the Gilboa stumps also helps in understanding the broader changes that occurred during the Devonian, ''the age of the greening of the earth,'' as Dr. Stein described it. ''By the end of the Devonian, all the major classes of plants were present, except for flowering plants,'' he said. ''The modern ecology had been established.'' So knowing what plants like Eospermatopteris were really like, he said, ''is critical for understanding how the ecosystem becomes set.'' Observatory"
"As American food safety regulators head to China to investigate how a chemical made from coal found its way into pet food that killed dogs and cats in the United States, workers in this heavily polluted northern city openly admit that the substance is routinely added to animal feed as a fake protein. For years, producers of animal feed all over China have secretly supplemented their feed with the substance, called melamine, a cheap additive that looks like protein in tests, even though it does not provide any nutritional benefits, according to melamine scrap traders and agricultural workers here. ''Many companies buy melamine scrap to make animal feed, such as fish feed,'' said Ji Denghui, general manager of the Fujian Sanming Dinghui Chemical Company, which sells melamine. ''I don't know if there's a regulation on it. Probably not. No law or regulation says 'don't do it,' so everyone's doing it. The laws in China are like that, aren't they? If there's no accident, there won't be any regulation.'' Melamine is at the center of a recall of 60 million packages of pet food, after the chemical was found in wheat gluten linked this month to the deaths of at least 16 pets and the illness of possibly thousands of pets in the United States. No one knows exactly how melamine (which is not believed to be particularly toxic) became so fatal in pet food, but its presence in any form of American food is illegal. The link to China has set off concerns among critics of the Food and Drug Administration that ingredients in pet food as well as human food, which are increasingly coming from abroad, are not being adequately screened. ''They have fewer people inspecting product at the ports than ever before,'' says Caroline Smith DeWaal, the director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. ''Until China gets programs in place to verify the safety of their products, they need to be inspected by U.S. inspectors. This open-door policy on food ingredients is an open invitation for an attack on the food supply, either intentional or unintentional.'' Now, with evidence mounting that the tainted wheat gluten came from China, American regulators have been granted permission to visit the region to conduct inspections of food treatment facilities. The Food and Drug Administration has already banned imports of wheat gluten from China after it received more than 14,000 reports of pets believed to have been sickened by packaged food. And last week, the agency opened a criminal investigation in the case and searched the offices of at least one pet food supplier. The Department of Agriculture has also stepped in. On Thursday, the agency ordered more than 6,000 hogs to be quarantined or slaughtered after some of the pet food ingredients laced with melamine were accidentally sent to hog farms in eight states, including California. The pet food case is also putting China's agricultural exports under greater scrutiny because the country has had a terrible food safety record. In recent years, for instance, China's food safety scandals have involved everything from fake baby milk formulas and soy sauce made from human hair to instances where cuttlefish were soaked in calligraphy ink to improve their color and eels were fed contraceptive pills to make them grow long and slim. For their part, Chinese officials dispute any suggestion that melamine from the country could have killed pets. But regulators here on Friday banned the use of melamine in vegetable proteins made for export or for use in domestic food supplies. Yet what is clear from visiting this region of northeast China is that for years melamine has been quietly mixed into Chinese animal feed and then sold to unsuspecting farmers as protein-rich pig, poultry and fish feed. Many animal feed operators here advertise on the Internet, seeking to purchase melamine scrap. The Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company, one of the companies that American regulators named as having shipped melamine-tainted wheat gluten to the United States, had posted such a notice on the Internet last March. Here at the Shandong Mingshui Great Chemical Group factory, huge boiler vats are turning coal into melamine, which is then used to create plastics and fertilizer. But the leftover melamine scrap, golf ball-size chunks of white rock, is sometimes being sold to local agricultural entrepreneurs, who say they mix a powdered form of the scrap into animal feed to deceive those who raise animals into thinking they are buying feed that is high in protein. ''It just saves money if you add melamine scrap,'' said the manager of an animal feed factory here. Last Friday here in Zhangqiu, a fast-growing industrial city southeast of Beijing, two animal feed producers explained in great detail how they purchase low-grade wheat, corn, soybean or other proteins and then mix in small portions of nitrogen-rich melamine scrap, whose chemical properties help the feed register an inflated protein level. Melamine is the new scam of choice, they say, because urea -- another nitrogen-rich chemical -- is illegal for use in pig and poultry feed and can be easily detected in China as well as in the United States. ''People use melamine scrap to boost nitrogen levels for the tests,'' said the manager of the animal feed factory. ''If you add it in small quantities, it won't hurt the animals.'' The manager, who works at a small animal feed operation here that consists of a handful of storage and mixing areas, said he has mixed melamine scrap into animal feed for years. He said he was not currently using melamine. But he then pulled out a plastic bag containing what he said was melamine powder and said he could dye it any color to match the right feed stock. He said that melamine used in pet food would probably not be harmful. ''Pets are not like pigs or chickens,'' he said casually, explaining that they can afford to eat less protein. ''They don't need to grow fast.'' The resulting melamine-tainted feed would be weak in protein, he acknowledged, which means the feed is less nutritious. But, by using the melamine additive, the feed seller makes a heftier profit because melamine scrap is much cheaper than soy, wheat or corn protein. ''It's true you can make a lot more profit by putting melamine in,'' said another animal feed seller here in Zhangqiu. ''Melamine will cost you about $1.20 for each protein count per ton whereas real protein costs you about $6, so you can see the difference.'' Feed producers who use melamine here say the tainted feed is often shipped to feed mills in the Yangtze River Delta, near Shanghai, or down to Guangdong Province, near Hong Kong. They also said they knew that some melamine-laced feed had been exported to other parts of Asia, including South Korea, North Korea, Indonesia and Thailand. Evidence is mounting that Chinese protein exports have been tainted with melamine and that its use in agricultural regions like this one is widespread. But the government has issued no recall of any food or feed product here in China. Indeed, few people outside the agriculture business know about the use of melamine scrap. The Chinese news media -- which is strictly censored -- has not reported much about the country's ties to the pet food recall in the United States. And few in agriculture here do not see any harm in using melamine in small doses; they simply see it as cheating a little on protein, not harming animals or pets. As for the sale of melamine scrap, it is increasingly popular as a fake ingredient in feed, traders and workers here say. At the Hebei Haixing Insect Net Factory in nearby Hebei Province, which makes animal feed, a manager named Guo Qingyin said: ''In the past melamine scrap was free, but the price has been going up in the past few years. Consumption of melamine scrap is probably bigger than that of urea in the animal feed industry now.'' And so melamine producers like the ones here in Zhangqiu are busy. A man named Jing, who works in the sales department at the Shandong Mingshui Great Chemical Group factory here, said on Friday that prices have been rising, but he said that he had no idea how the company's melamine scrap is used. ''We have an auction for melamine scrap every three months,'' he said. ''I haven't heard of it being added to animal feed. It's not for animal feed.''"
"New York and six other Northeastern states announced yesterday that they have joined in a regional pact to try to force the federal government to enact tougher standards on mercury emissions. Claiming that they have done about as much as they can to reduce mercury pollution within their own borders, the states plan to focus on airborne mercury that drifts into the region from the Midwest, particularly from those states where coal-fired power plants are the prime source of electricity. The Northeastern states acknowledge that they have little power to force other states to reduce smokestack emissions. But by banding together, they hope to pressure the federal government to enact national standards. ''The states can do a great deal on their own, but they cannot solve the problem,'' said Pete Grannis, the new commissioner of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. ''But New York and its sister states can gang up on Washington to force the administration's hand to move ahead on this.'' Northeastern states have already tried a similar approach to compel Washington to act on environmental issues. In December 2005, New York and six other states formed a Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to curtail smokestack emissions that contribute to global climate change. Several other states subsequently expressed their intention to join the group or form their own, increasing pressure on the federal government. Under the draft mercury plan announced yesterday, the states would use provisions of the federal Clean Water Act to establish maximum levels of mercury that local lakes and rivers could absorb. Calculations of those maximum levels would recognize that the majority of mercury pollution in the region comes from other states. Thus, for the Northeastern states to meet federal clean water standards, the other states would have to reduce the amount of mercury they put into the air. ''We have to remind the administration that this is a serious and ongoing problem,'' Mr. Grannis said. ''The federal government needs to come in and set national standards.'' Besides New York, the states cooperating in the mercury agreement are Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. The states worked with the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission to put together the draft plan. Throughout the Northeast, mercury contamination has become a growing health concern. Mercury is a metal that occurs naturally. It is released in a gaseous form when coal is burned in electrical generating plants. Smokestack emissions drift across state borders, and the mercury lands far from where it was released. As the mercury falls on lakes and streams, it becomes methylmercury, a neurotoxin that accumulates in fish, with concentrations increasing in larger fish that eat smaller ones. The presence of harmful levels of mercury has led to health advisories limiting the consumption of sport fish taken from thousands of lakes, rivers and streams in the Northeast. In New York State, most of the lakes and streams in the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains are posted with consumption advisories because of excessive mercury levels. In recent years, New York has taken several actions to reduce or eliminate mercury contamination. The state has adopted tough air control standards to reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants within its borders by 90 percent by 2015, far exceeding existing federal regulations. The state has also tried to reduce the amount of elemental mercury in the environment by requiring dentists to collect and recycle mercury in dental fillings so that it is not flushed down drains or thrown into the trash. According to the draft plan, reducing the amount of mercury contamination in the region by 86 percent to 98 percent would cause the amount of mercury in fish to decline to levels at which consumption advisories could be lifted. Public hearings on the draft plan will be held in New York State on May 2 to 4. Locations for the hearings, and a copy of the draft plan, are available on the Department of Environmental Conservation Web site, www.dec.state.ny.us."
"More than 30 years have passed since Congress banned a broad range of synthetic compounds called PCBs. Yet 2.65 million cubic yards of mud on the bottom of the Hudson River remain contaminated with the chemicals, which are considered neurotoxins and probable human carcinogens. Since 2002, General Electric has been under federal order to clean approximately 40 miles of the Hudson where its factories discharged PCBs. Preliminary site clearing for the huge project began last week, but actual dredging will not start until 2009 at the earliest. Here, on another PCB-contaminated river about 60 miles to the southeast in Massachusetts, G.E. has made more progress, albeit haltingly. Working with the federal government, the company completed the cleanup of a two-mile stretch of the Housatonic River late last year, scooping out the heaviest concentrations of the industrial chemicals. While much remains to be done along the remaining 100 miles or more of the Housatonic, its most heavily contaminated section is now cleaner than it has been in a long time. The two projects differ in scale and expense as much as the two rivers differ in depth and breadth, and each presents unique engineering challenges. The Hudson project covers 40 miles of the broad river from which the 2.65 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment will have to be dredged, at an estimated cost of $700 million. By contrast, the first phase of the cleanup of the Housatonic, a far gentler river, had a price tag of $250 million and involved 110,000 cubic yards of mud. Still, the Housatonic cleanup dragged on for more than six years, twice the expected time. And there is no timetable or cost estimate yet for decontaminating the river's lower reaches. Based on their experience on the Housatonic, scientists, G.E. officials, government authorities and people who live in the local communities affected by PCBs all agree that work on the Hudson, whenever it starts, is likely to take far longer than expected and will run into more technological obstacles than anyone anticipates. Almost certainly, the level of public suspicion and mistrust surrounding these projects will not soon subside. Peter L. deFur, an environmental consultant who advises local groups concerned about the Housatonic cleanup, said that although the company had belatedly been doing a ''pretty good'' job on the river, the people who live along the Hudson should be warned that ''G.E. has been absolutely the opposite of a responsible party.'' Stephen D. Ramsey, G.E.'s vice president for corporate environmental programs, who is overseeing both cleanups, said the company had proved its good faith by spending more than a billion dollars studying and cleaning up PCBs, mostly in these two rivers. But he said there is little that G.E. can do to change perceptions ''except to be very clear with the public about what is the status of the project, what people can expect to see and what are the issues we are encountering as we go along.'' In the last century, G.E. discovered many profitable ways of using PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, a slippery yellowish goo as thick as motor oil that can resist heat without catching fire. G.E. used vast quantities at its Hudson Falls and Fort Edward factories on the Hudson to build electrical capacitors. At its sprawling plant here on the Housatonic, G.E. used them in transformers. After the chemicals were banned in 1976, the company agreed to clean up its properties. But it argued that the vast quantities of PCBs that had been discharged into the rivers would break down on their own or be harmlessly buried under a protective layer of silt. At first the federal Environmental Protection Agency agreed. As scientific understanding advanced, however, the agency decided to take a second look. Even nestled in the river mud, the chemicals were being ingested by worms and other invertebrates, which were in turn eaten by small fish, and those were eaten by larger ones, which eventually were consumed by people. The only ways to solve the problem, the E.P.A. decided in the late 1980s, were to remove or cap the PCBs. G.E. spent millions of dollars on advertising trying to convince local residents that dredging was worse than doing nothing, but the company eventually accepted a plan to clean more than 40 miles of the Hudson, from Fort Edward to the Troy dam, in two phases. The first phase, a kind of trial run to last one year, was originally set to begin in 2006 but is now set for 2009. The final phase is scheduled to last five years. The Housatonic cleanup has a more compact history. The 254-acre G.E. plant in Pittsfield used PCBs from 1932 until they were banned. Storm water runoff from the plant carried the chemicals into the Housatonic, where they spread downstream, contaminating more than 100 miles of river in Massachusetts and Connecticut. In 1999, G.E. agreed to a $250 million settlement to clean a highly contaminated half-mile portion of the river that ran through the company's property in Pittsfield. Because the Housatonic in that area is only a few feet deep and a few yards wide, G.E. could, in essence, dry-clean the river. At the end of 1999, it started work on a temporary dam across half the river, and when that half-mile section of the riverbed dried out, front-end loaders scraped off two feet of mud and dumped it onto trucks to be buried at G.E.'s Pittsfield property. The temporary dam was then moved to the other side of the river, where the process was repeated. The E.P.A. cleaned the next 1.5 miles of river itself, billing G.E. for half the cost. The agency chose to divert the Housatonic through a large pipe and then bring in heavy equipment to scrape the river bottom. G.E. had other PCB problems in Pittsfield. Over the years, the company had given away PCB-soaked dirt and other material that property owners used as fill in their backyards. In the late 1990s, G.E. performed tests at more than 300 homes and ended up excavating the soil around more than 175 of them, as well as at one Pittsfield public school. A resident and former G.E. employee, David Gibbs, 56, found that several chemical drums had been buried in his backyard near the river. In a recent interview, Mr. Gibbs said that he caught G.E.'s contractors trying to cut corners as they cleaned up his property and that he developed a lasting mistrust of the company. ''My family's lived in this neighborhood for over 60 years,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''G.E. owes it to us to clean our river.'' Another resident, Tim Gray, 54, is executive director of the Housatonic River Initiative, which acts as a watchdog on G.E.'s activities. Mr. Gray pushed to have Pittsfield added to the national list of Superfund sites, but local officials objected, saying they believed it would stigmatize the city, causing economic harm. In March, G.E. held public hearings in Massachusetts and Connecticut to discuss options for cleaning the 135 miles of river from Pittsfield south to the Long Island Sound. They range from dredging long stretches to doing nothing at all. At a hearing in Kent, Conn., G.E. presented data indicating that PCB concentrations in fish and invertebrates had declined substantially before leveling off in recent years. When the company suggested that the river was cleaning itself, Mr. Gray objected, as did Mr. deFur, the environmental consultant. ''I think they're trying to put something over on people,'' Mr. deFur said. If the river was cleaning itself, he said, concentrations would continue to decline. He said the chemicals were degraded in water but not destroyed. Continued leakage from the plant and an incomplete cleanup mean the riverremains polluted, he said. At the Hudson Falls plant, a few ounces of PCBs continue to leak into the river each day, according to G.E. Local environmental advocates express fears that the chemicals have also contaminated the soil beneath homes in the area, but G.E. has not agreed to a residential cleanup, as it did in Pittsfield. ''Pittsfield is a precedent that G.E. did not want to set,'' said Robert Goldstein, a lawyer for Riverkeeper, an environmental group on the Hudson. ''They did not want to advertise to the folks in Fort Edward that there was an upland cleanup.'' Since it would be impossible to reroute the Hudson the way the engineers diverted the Housatonic, Mr. Ramsey, the G.E. official, said the company would use old-fashioned mechanical dredging. A ''yellow iron Tonka Toy look-alike clamshell dredge'' will scoop up contaminated river mud and dump it on barges, he said. The dried sediment will then be shipped by rail to a licensed landfill outside the Hudson Valley, he said. Mr. Ramsey said the Housatonic project had taught him that even with advanced engineering, ''things take longer than everyone thinks.'' The biggest challenge on the Hudson will be ensuring that the dredged material is not set adrift, Mr. Ramsey said. He said the affected communities needed to understand that if monitoring shows that too much material is escaping, the operation could be slowed down or suspended. ''If there are starts and stops,'' Mr. Ramsey said, ''it won't be because anyone is trying to pull a fast one.'' Correction: May 7, 2007, Monday A map on Tuesday with an article comparing two PCB-removal projects by General Electric -- one on the Hudson River in New York and the other on the Housatonic in Massachusetts -- misspelled part of the name of a city near the G.E. factory in Hudson Falls, N.Y. It is Glens Falls, not Glen Falls."
"The workers, by and large, have been young and healthy. None were smokers, and none had any history of lung disease. But after working at plants that produce food flavorings, they all had one thing in common: they could not breathe. Over the last several years, California health officials have been tracking a handful of workers in flavoring factories who have been incapacitated with a rare, life-threatening lung condition -- bronchiolitis obliterans -- for which there is no cure or treatment. Usually found only in people who are poisoned by chemical fires or chemical warfare or in lung transplant patients, bronchiolitis obliterans renders its victims unable to exert even a little energy without becoming winded or faint. ''The airways to the lung have been eaten up,'' said Barbara Materna, the chief of the occupational health branch in the California Department of Health Services. ''They can't work anymore, and they can't walk a short distance without severe shortness of breath.'' Seven flavoring-factory workers in California are known to have the disease or similarly serious lung damage, and 22 others have had lung tests come back with abnormal results. In each case, scientists and health officials say, the common dominator is exposure to the vapors from a pungent yellow-colored flavoring called diacetyl, best known for giving microwave popcorn its buttery goodness. Officials from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration testified at a Congressional hearing last month on concerns about the additive. Several other federal agencies, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, are also investigating the effects of diacetyl, the subject of scores of civil lawsuits filed on behalf of victims of so-called popcorn lung. But in California, which has 28 flavoring plants known to use diacetyl, some legislators and government officials seem unwilling to wait. A bill to ban diacetyl in the workplace by 2010 has passed two committees in the State Assembly and could be taken up by the full body this summer. It is the first proposal of its kind in the nation. Assemblywoman Sally Lieber, the author of the bill, said she introduced it because of what she said was the slow response by the flavoring industry, which is largely self-regulating on occupational safety. ''What we've heard is that the flavoring industry has known for years that this is potentially a problem, and they haven't taken action,'' said Ms. Lieber, a Democrat. Officials in the flavoring industry, which had about $3.5 billion in sales in 2006, say they are well aware of the concerns surrounding diacetyl, but they strongly dispute that they have been lax. John B. Hallagan, the general counsel for the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, a trade group, said his members had provided information on worker health to state and federal authorities since 2001, shortly after the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued a report linking lung problems in 16 workers at a popcorn packaging plant in Missouri to diacetyl. Mr. Hallagan added that his group was working closely with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to ''help flavor manufacturers have the safest workplaces possible.'' Len Welsh, the acting chief of the occupational safety agency, a division of the state Department of Industrial Relations, said the trade group had been cooperative. ''They have done nothing but facilitate our involvement,'' Mr. Welsh said. Mr. Welsh's office is considering a petition by the California Labor Federation and the United Food and Commercial Workers union asking for immediate standards to be set to protect workers. An advisory committee is mulling recommendations to the occupational safety and health standards board at the state Department of Industrial Relations. The board, which sets the state's workplace standards, said in a report released in September that there was ''little question that serious respiratory illness in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans had occurred in association with occupational exposure to flavoring substances.'' The first case of bronchiolitis obliterans in flavoring-factory workers was reported in California in August 2004. The unidentified worker, who is now in his early 30s, had worked at a plant in Southern California since 2001 as a flavor compounder, handling and mixing diacetyl with other ingredients in cauldron-like blenders. Early symptoms included wheezing, chest pain and cough. Soon, the man was unable to walk more than 15 feet without breathing heavily. In April 2006, state authorities found another worker with similar symptoms, and officials have since confirmed five other cases of ''severe fixed obstructive lung disease.'' All of the victims worked in factories in California. At the time they sought medical attention, they ranged in age from 27 to 44. One of them is now on a list for a lung transplant, Ms. Materna, the California health official, said. ''When you're talking about handling the pure material, it's a very concentrated and very strong chemical,'' she said. ''And it was typically handled without precaution. There was no particular recognition that this chemical had this very severe health effect.'' Mr. Welsh, the California Occupational Safety and Health Authority official, said two California companies had been fined for failing to protect workers, and 26 others had agreed to conduct health screenings and make workplace changes that included covering vats, providing respirators and masks, and installing better ventilation. Still, he said, his office is having trouble keeping up. ''I wish we'd gotten out act together faster,'' he said. While diacetyl has long been used in so-called flavor houses like the factory in Southern California, concerns about its safety date to the mid-1970s, said Dr. David Egilman, a clinical associate professor of community health at Brown University. Dr. Egilman has worked as a litigation consultant for popcorn workers and wrote a recent paper about diacetyl published in the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health. ''There's lots of cases where this chemical is the only consistent factor,'' he said. ''And there's a lot more disease out there than people know.'' Mr. Hallagan, the trade group lawyer, said manufacturers used higher concentrations of diacetyl in response to consumer preferences. Still, he said, manufacturers were looking to lower the concentration, without robbing the consumer of flavor. ''There is no single substance that can replace diacetyl because it is the single substance most responsible for the 'buttery note,' '' Mr. Hallagan wrote in a response to questions about the chemical. Mr. Hallagan said that data on any link between diacetyl and lung disease was inconclusive, but that his industry was not waiting for definitive proof. He said many flavor manufacturers had already embraced better ventilation, employee health testing, and new safety and educational programs. Ms. Lieber, the California legislator, said a better solution might be to take the chemical out of the workplace altogether. ''It's not like we're talking about a potential flaw in the polio vaccine,'' she said. ''We are talking about a potentially devastating disease caused by buttering flavor. And there are alternatives out there. Including butter.''"
"ONE giant cardboard box held hundreds of power cords, coiled like snakes, and a tower of computer monitors, wrapped in plastic, stood six feet high. Piled on a wooden pallet were electronic relics -- like a Soundesign combination record player-radio-eight-track player. Montclair's biannual electronic-waste collection had been under way for less than an hour, and dozens of residents had already dropped off carloads of so-called e-waste. ''My biggest joy is getting rid of those old C.R.T. monitors,'' Chris Ehrenbard, a Montclair resident, said at the site. Spring is when many municipalities hold special collections of electronic equipment that might have once found its way into a landfill. It is also the time for household hazardous-waste collections, where residents can get rid of pesticides, paints and solvents, and trash like tires, motor oil and batteries. ''It's definitely the season when people clean out their basements and closets,'' said Gray Russell, Montclair's environmental coordinator, who said the March 31 collection netted 22.7 tons of waste. The town paid a contractor, Advanced Recovery, of Port Jervis, N.Y., $300 to handle the materials -- a bargain compared with the $1,650 it would have spent to incinerate it all, Mr. Russell said. ''We're doing better financially, plus we're doing good for human health and preventing valuable stuff from being destroyed,'' he said. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are considering laws to require recycling of a variety of electronic equipment like computer parts, which are rife with the toxic metals lead, cadmium and mercury. While there are no state or federal laws that bar residents from dumping chemicals with their trash or down the drain, local governments began encouraging people to recycle them in the 1970s and '80s. About half of the waste collected at municipal events is recycled, said John Kelsey, the vice president of Clean Harbors Environmental Services, of Norwell, Mass. It contracts with local governments in the New York City area, taking in about one million pounds of material a year. Lead from car batteries can be removed and resold to vendors who need it for other products; used antifreeze and motor oil can be cleaned and repackaged, often ending up back on the store shelf, Mr. Kelsey said. Toxins like pesticides and vermin killers usually cannot be recycled and are incinerated, he said. Advanced Recovery says it stages hundreds of e-waste recycling events in New York and New Jersey, netting almost 300 million tons a year. Mark Rea, the company president, said that 99.7 percent of the items are resold, either as repaired products or after the electronic equipment has been harvested for parts. ''There is a market for everything,'' he said. Glass from monitors and televisions can be ground down and recycled into windshields. Precious metals like gold and copper can be salvaged from computer gear. Some electronic equipment, like televisions, is even sold to antiques collectors. E-waste recycling days are so popular in the Town of North Hempstead on Long Island that it expanded the service this year to include drop-offs every Sunday, said Michael P. Engelmann, the acting director of the solid-waste management authority. But the largest amount of material collected during household hazardous-waste days is paint related, solid-waste managers say. Latex paint is not toxic but is a nuisance, clogging recycling machinery and staining trucks, said Thomas J. Nosker, a professor of materials science and engineering at Rutgers University. Rutgers and Re-Manufacturing Technologies, of East Brunswick, N.J., are trying to address that problem by creating a system that dries latex paint and uses the remaining polymers to create new plastic, Mr. Nosker said. Using old paint means less raw material is needed to create a plastic product, and in some cases the recycled paint polymers made the end product more flexible and tough, he said. The partnership, announced in March, is about a year from moving from the laboratory to a commercial enterprise, Mr. Nosker said. Many agencies do not accept latex paint, but in New Jersey, the Bergen County Utilities Authority accepts it at seven hazardous-waste events throughout the year, said Richard Baroch, the solid- and special-waste program coordinator. He said the county takes in about one million pounds of waste a year -- although not always without incident. In March a resident came in with a small container of picric acid, which is highly explosive. ''We did have to evacuate the area and bring in the bomb squad,'' Mr. Baroch said. Alain Fortier, the hazardous-waste supervisor in Monmouth County, N.J., said many towns use innovative ways to deal with waste. For about 10 years, Monmouth has used propane collected from tanks brought by residents to heat a small warehouse and office building. E-waste collected in Rockland County, N.Y., that can be salvaged goes to two nonprofit groups that distribute rehabilitated cellphones and computers to needy people, said Janet Lee Burnet, the program assistant for the county's Solid Waste Management Authority. The county, one of the few in the region to offer permanent collection operations on weekdays, also started accepting many kinds of old medications two years ago, and New York State gave the authority $1.2 million in grants this year, Ms. Burnet said. Noting residents' concerns about identity theft as well as the proliferation of paper, Westchester County bought a large portable paper shredder last year for $65,000, said Robert A. Morabito, the deputy commissioner of environmental facilities. At the first two collection efforts of the year, in February and in April, the shredder devoured 10 tons of documents. ''Most people might shred at home, but it just winds up in the garbage stream,'' Mr. Morabito said. Reselling the shreds to a paper company nets the county about $100 a ton. In 2003 the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority started allowing businesses to participate in household hazardous-waste days, said Lori Vitagliano, the hazardous-waste central coordinator. The authority goes a step further: Residents who drop off household hazardous waste get a recipe for less toxic cleaners using vinegar and Borax. ''That way,'' Mrs. Vitagliano said, ''you don't even have to use some of these hazardous items.''"
"The Chinese authorities are investigating whether two companies from this coastal region exported poison-tainted toothpaste as more of the product, including some made specifically for children, has turned up in Latin America. A team of government investigators arrived here Sunday afternoon and closed the factory of the Danyang City Success Household Chemical Company, a small building housing about 30 workers in a nearby village, according to villagers and one factory worker. The government also questioned the manager of another toothpaste maker, Goldcredit International Trading, which is in Wuxi, about an hour's drive southeast of here. No tainted toothpaste has been found in the United States, but a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that the agency would be taking ''a hard look'' at whether to issue an import alert. Authorities in the Dominican Republic said they seized 36,000 tubes of toothpaste suspected of containing diethylene glycol, an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in some antifreeze. Included were tubes of toothpaste marketed for children with bubble gum and strawberry flavors sold under the name of Mr. Cool Junior. Toothpaste containing the toxic solvent was also found in Panama and Australia in the last week. Bautista Rojas Gómez, the secretary of health of the Dominican Republic, said the toothpaste, with diethylene glycol listed as an ingredient, was found in stores and warehouses across the country, including ones near the Haitian border. Diethylene glycol is the same poison that the Panamanian government unwittingly mixed into cold medicine last year, killing at least 100 people. In that case, the poison, falsely labeled as glycerin, a harmless syrup, originated in China, shipping records show. Diethylene glycol is generally less expensive than its chemical cousin glycerin. Panamanian authorities said they believed that the tainted toothpaste found in their country, containing up to 4.6 percent diethylene glycol, came from China. Executives from both companies under investigation in China denied in interviews on Monday that they had exported any toothpaste containing diethylene glycol to Panama. ''We didn't do this; we didn't make the bad stuff,'' said Shi Lei, a manager at Danyang City Success. ''It was probably someone else.'' But Ms. Shi and other toothpaste makers in this region said that diethylene glycol had been used in toothpaste in China for years and that producers believed that it was not very harmful. Government investigators arrived here just days after customs officials in Panama said that they had discovered diethylene glycol in 6,000 tubes of toothpaste. The toothpaste was being sold under the English brand names Mr. Cool and Excel. There have been no reports of deaths tied to toothpaste containing the chemical. Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, deputy director for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the F.D.A., said diethylene glycol levels found in some Panamanian toothpaste were nearly 50 times what is deemed safe. ''Kids swallow toothpaste,'' Dr. Throckmorton said. ''That is going to be a concern to you.'' Suspicion over China's role in the tainted toothpaste and cold medicine comes just weeks after investigators blamed two Chinese companies for intentionally shipping pet food ingredients contaminated with an industrial chemical to the United States, leading to one of the largest pet food recalls in history. The cases are fueling mounting concerns about the quality and safety of China's food and drug exports and threatening to turn into a trade dispute. After initially rejecting any Chinese role in the tainted pet food, Beijing officials banned the use of melamine, an industrial chemical used in fertilizer and plastics, from vegetable proteins. Melamine and several related chemicals were discovered in contaminated pet food ingredients. Chinese officials also promised to overhaul food safety regulations and tighten export controls. The government does seem to have responded quickly to reports last weekend about contaminated toothpaste. Hu Keyu, the manager at Goldcredit International, said investigators talked to him over the weekend because his company was the first to sell and export toothpaste under the brand Mr. Cool. But he and his staff insisted that Goldcredit never exported to Panama, and that this year the company had exported only a small amount of Mr. Cool toothpaste to Australia. Goldcredit executives said they did not sell toothpaste under the Excel brand name. Mr. Hu said his company exported toothpaste, toothbrushes, glue and other goods to the United States, Europe and other regions but that his company no longer uses diethylene glycol. He said, however, that most toothpaste makers in this region use diethylene glycol because it is considered a cheap substitute for glycerin. ''You know, if you're in the export market, the margins are small, so people use the substitute,'' he said. ''Even 1 percent or half a percent price difference can matter to people here.'' Executives from Goldcredit and Danyang said that the Mr. Cool brand had been copied by several other companies and that numerous trading companies could be exporting the products. Danyang City Success Household Chemical, however, said that while it did not export to Panama, it had used diethylene glycol in its toothpaste and that the government did not have a clear regulation on how much could be added. Danyang City Success is a small company in a village in Danyang, where the city's entrance boasts that it has been designated one of China's ''national sanitary'' cities for its cleanliness. Danyang City Success produces both Mr. Cool and Excel and exports toothpaste around the world, including Europe and Africa, company executives said. But this afternoon, villagers and one young factory worker, who declined to give her name, said that investigators had arrived Sunday night and closed the factory to investigate possible contamination in its exports. Ms. Shi, one of the managers along with her husband, met a reporter at the entrance to the factory and insisted her company had nothing to do with the case in Panama. Inside the gate a team of investigators could be seen meeting with company executives and then departing with a bag of documents. Villagers said the investigators were provincial and local officials, including the village's Communist Party secretary. The sister of the party secretary, who gave her name only as Miss Hu, said Danyang City Success had been in business for four or five years and that it was run by a former salesman and his wife, Ms. Shi, who grew up in the village. ''He used to sell packaging materials. Then he saved up his money and started this toothpaste company,'' she said. ''But lately the company has been struggling.'' Mr. Hu at Goldcredit said that while he did not produce the toothpaste shipped to Panama, diethylene glycol had been used for years at very low levels in Chinese toothpaste as a glycerin substitute. ''If diethylene glycol were poisonous,'' he said, ''all Chinese people would have been poisoned.''"
"A second industrial chemical that American regulators have identified as a pet food contaminant may have been intentionally added to animal feed by producers seeking larger profits, according to interviews Tuesday with chemical industry officials. Three chemical makers said Chinese animal feed producers often came to purchase cyanuric acid to blend into their feed because it was cheaper and helped increase protein content. In the United States, cyanuric acid is often used as a chemical stabilizer in swimming pools, though it is not thought to be highly toxic on its own. Up until now, American regulators had focused on a chemical called melamine. Animal feed producers here have acknowledged recently that for years they added melamine to animal feed to gain bigger profit margins. But American regulators and scientists have also been aware for several weeks that cyanuric acid may have played a role in causing sickness or death in pets. China said on Tuesday that it had found two companies guilty of intentionally exporting pet food ingredients containing melamine to the United States. The country's watchdog for quality control released a statement on its Web site late Tuesday saying officials at the two companies were also detained for their roles in shipping tainted goods that may have contributed to one of the largest pet food recalls in American history. ''The two companies illegally added melamine'' to wheat gluten and rice protein, the government said, ''in a bid to meet the contractual demand for the amount of protein in the products.'' The revelations from chemical producers help address uncertainties about the presence of cyanuric acid. For instance, it has not been clear whether it is a derivative or a byproduct when melamine is broken down in the animals, or whether the cyanuric acid was separately placed in the feed. In China, chemical producers say it is common knowledge in the chemical and agriculture industry that for years feed producers in China have quietly and secretly used cyanuric acid to cheat buyers of animal feed. ''Cyanuric acid scrap can be added to animal feed,'' said Yu Luwei, general manager of the Juancheng Ouya Chemical Company in Shandong Province. ''I sell it to fish meal manufacturers and fish farmers. It can also be added to feed for other animals.'' Yang Fei, who works in the sales department of the Shouguang Weidong Chemical Company in Shandong Province, echoed that view: ''I've heard that people add cyanuric acid and melamine to animal feed to boost the protein level.'' The Food and Drug Administration in the United States said Tuesday that farmed fish had been fed meal contaminated with melamine and other contaminants but that the level was probably too low to harm anyone who ate the fish. Moreover, the feed was mislabeled as wheat gluten, when in fact it was wheat flour spiked with melamine and other nitrogen-rich compounds to make it appear more protein-rich than it was, officials said. Two of the Chinese chemical makers say that cyanuric acid is used because it is even cheaper than melamine and high in nitrogen, enabling feed producers to artificially increase protein readings which are often measured by nitrogen levels of the feed. The chemical makers say they also produce a chemical which is a combination of melamine and cyanuric acid, and that feed producers have often sought to purchase scrap material from this product. Competition among animal feed producers here is intense. But the practice of using cyanuric acid may now provide clues as to why the pet food in the United States became poisonous. Scientists had difficulty pinpointing the precise cause of the deaths, for neither melamine nor cyanuric acid are thought to be particularly toxic by themselves. But scientists studying the pet food deaths say the combination of the two chemicals, mixed together with perhaps some other related compounds, may have created a toxic punch that formed crystals in the kidneys of pets and led to kidney failure. ''I'm convinced melamine can't do it by itself,'' said Richard Goldstein, an assistant professor at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. ''I think it's this melamine with other compounds that is toxic.'' On May 1, scientists at the University of Guelph in Canada said they had made a chemical discovery that may explain the pet deaths. In a laboratory, they found that melamine and cyanuric acid may react with one another to form crystals that could impair kidney function. The crystals they formed in the lab were similar to those discovered in afflicted pets, they said. In the United States, some contaminated pet food and protein meal recently found its way into hog and chicken feed, which led the government to ask farms to quarantine and slaughter some animals as precaution. But on Monday, a joint assessment by scientists working for the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department and several other federal agencies said there was a very low risk of danger to humans who consume meat from animals that were accidentally fed melamine-tainted feed. The scientists said the dilution was a major factor in lowering the risk. The government also said that both chickens and hogs fed the melamine-tainted feed appear to be healthy. In pets that apparently consumed a higher concentration of melamine, however, a result was often kidney failure. The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine in China said an investigation named two animal feed companies previously under suspicion: the Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company and the Binzhou Futian Biology Technology Company. China essentially acknowledged Tuesday that the two companies had cheated pet food companies by adding a fake protein to the feed to make pet food suppliers think that they were purchasing higher-protein feed when in fact they were getting lower-protein feed. China also said that a nationwide survey did not uncover other companies using melamine in feed products. Chemical producers of cyanuric acid, however, say the practice for them may be different. ''The substance is nontoxic -- it's legal to add it to animal feed,'' Mr. Yu at Juancheng Ouya Chemical said of cyanuric acid. ''The practice has been around for many years. I often sell it to animal feed makers.''"
"Ever since pet food contaminated with an industrial chemical was traced to shipments of wheat flour from China, American officials have concentrated on cracking down on imports. It turns out the problem was closer to home, too. Yesterday, federal officials announced that a manufacturing plant in Ohio was using the same banned substance, melamine, to make binding agents that ended up in feed for farmed fish, shrimp and livestock. The problem surfaced after a distributor, concerned about what was in its feed binders after the reports from China, sent the product to a private laboratory for testing. The melamine was used by Tembec BTLSR, a Canadian forest products company with a small chemical plant in Toledo, to make binding agents that keep pellets of animal feed together, said Dr. David Acheson, assistant commissioner for food protection at the Food and Drug Administration. Melamine is not permitted in food or pet food products. In the last few months, pet food contaminated with melamine, all traced back to China, sickened or killed thousands of pets in the United States. Dr. Acheson said the levels of melamine and melamine-related compounds in Tembec's products were far lower than that found in wheat flour from China that ended up killing the pets. Consequently, the authorities said that they thought the contamination did not appear to pose a risk to human health. Nevertheless, the F.D.A. issued a voluntary recall of finished feed made with two binding agents: Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II, which are made by Tembec and used in fish and shrimp feed. A third product, Xtra-Bond, which is made by a Colorado firm called Uniscope using Tembec ingredients, was not recalled because the levels of melamine were low. Uniscope is the distributor of all three products. Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II are sold mostly overseas; Xtra-Bond is sold domestically. Agency officials are alerting the foreign governments that received the products, Dr. Acheson said. The investigation began on May 18 when Uniscope alerted the agency that it had discovered melamine in the testing. Dr. Acheson said that the investigation was in its early stages and that some questions remained unanswered, like how long Tembec had used melamine in its products and the extent of the contamination. ''What Tembec knew, didn't know, what their activities were, is part of the investigation,'' Dr. Acheson said, at a news conference. Earlier, he said, ''It's hard to believe that a manufacturer of pet food would not know about this.'' Federal officials would not say whether they would pursue criminal charges in the Tembec case. They said that they had already been contacting domestic manufacturers to make sure they were aware of the sources of their ingredients. John Valley, Tembec's executive vice president for business development and corporate affairs, said his company thought that Uniscope was shipping the binders overseas for use as shrimp feed. Once the F.D.A. told it that the binders were being used domestically, Tembec stopped making them from melamine, Mr. Valley said. Tembec makes resins and certain chemicals for industrial uses, including melamine. Mr. Valley said Uniscope was the only customer that used its products for animal feed. Asked why it was all right to use melamine in feed for shrimp overseas but not in the United States, he said: ''Melamine has just really had a focus that's come upon it. A lot of companies and agencies are reviewing certain applications of melamine.'' The pet food scandal has led to increased scrutiny of all food imports, particularly those from China, and threatened trade relations. Some members of Congress have demanded tougher inspections of food imports from China. ''This recent incident goes to show that we apparently have some bad actors out there,'' said Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia. ''It can happen in the United States.'' But Mr. Doyle pointed out that the incidence of food illness remains relatively rare in the United States. The problem with the Tembec binders surfaced after Uniscope, a company based in Johnstown, Colo., decided to test the binders. ''They just asked themselves, 'I wonder what's in this stuff? I wonder if we have anything in here that shouldn't be in here?' '' said Charlie Russell, a company spokesman. ''So they sent some samples to a lab.'' Tembec has been a supplier to Uniscope since January 2004, Mr. Russell said. Employees at Uniscope, which was founded in 1975 and is family owned, thought that they were buying a resin that was fit for animal consumption, Mr. Russell said. Uniscope sells the binders to feed manufacturers that mix them with grain and other ingredients to make food pellets for livestock and fish, he said. The binders are sold both domestically and abroad, Mr. Russell said. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tembec acquired BTLSR Toledo, a custom manufacturer of spray-dry resins, for $8.5 million in 2003."
"After a week of confusion and worry that led the mayor here to step in and close a middle school, state environmental workers on Wednesday carted away two truckloads of soil contaminated with old, banned pesticides unearthed last fall. Students at the West Brook Middle School and their parents questioned why the soil -- containing pesticides at levels of up to 39 times the state's safety guidelines -- was not removed when it was discovered five months ago, and why they were told of the problem only last week. School officials said that approximately 40 cubic yards of dirt, possibly contaminated decades ago, was dug up during renovations to the 47-year-old school last fall. It was piled near classrooms. In December, an environmental testing group hired by the school district found the dirt contained chlordane, aldrin and dieldrin, chemicals banned by the Environmental Protection Agency because of concerns about their effects on human health. ''I'm upset that they knew about this, and I don't know who dropped the ball,'' said Janet Bisceglie, who said her daughter, an eighth grader at the school, has been having pseudoseizures recently, the cause of which has not yet been determined. James J. Tedesco III, the mayor of this Bergen County borough of 26,500, ordered the school closed on Tuesday night, after about 200 people showed up at a Borough Council meeting to express concern about the safety of its 700 students. He said he was dismayed that he learned about the contamination from articles in The Record, in Hackensack, N.J., rather than through official channels. Tests will be conducted on Thursday for possible contamination of the school itself in an effort to determine whether it is safe. Mario V. Sicari, the school board president, said that the district was planning to use Bergen Community College classrooms in Paramus for the rest of the school year, beginning on Monday. The school board approved the move last night. While three different pesticides were discovered in the soil, a statement issued on Wednesday by the district referred only to the chlordane, a pesticide that was historically used to keep termites from building foundations. The statement said that ''since this type of chemical is normally found underground around foundations,'' it is not a major concern to the state environmental agency. Aldrin, another of the pesticides found in the dirt, was historically used aboveground on crops, according to the state environmental agency, and eventually breaks down into dieldrin. Lisa P. Jackson, commissioner of the state environmental agency, offered to speed up the testing and removal of the contaminated soil, though she said the school district would have to pay for the removal. ''We want to try to move this along,'' Ms. Jackson said in a phone interview. ''We're investigating over there, how this came to be.'' She said hazardous waste cannot be stored on property for more than 90 days. She added, ''In a case like this, we would've preferred that it be taken off as soon as possible.'' Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said the agency learned just last week about the contaminated dirt and sent an inspector out the same day. Jerome F. Bohnert, the district's business administrator, said he was told that aldrin and dieldrin were not considered hazardous waste, but that chlordane was. In describing the time between the discovery of the pesticides last December and the closing of the school, Mr. Bohnert told of conflicting advice that he said school officials received from environmental consultants, the state's Department of Environmental Protection and its contractors. The company that tested the soil, Melick-Tully and Associates of South Bound Brook, N.J., reported its findings to the school district's building and grounds committee in late December, Mr. Bohnert said. But it was not until February, he said, that the committee asked the contractor, McCann Acoustics and Construction Inc. of Nutley, N.J., to remove it. In March, Mr. Bohnert said, McCann Acoustics responded, saying that its lawyer believed the district, not the contractor, was responsible for disposing of the soil. At that point, he explained, the district was advised by its environmental lawyers that it would need to do additional testing before it could move the dirt. State regulations would allow it to be diluted with uncontaminated soil or removed. Mr. Bohnert said some of the conflicting advice he received played down the potential danger posed by the pesticides. One environmental consultant told him a person would have to ingest the contaminated soil for a long time before suffering liver or kidney problems. School officials pointed out that it would have been legal for them to simply spread out the soil without testing it, but they had wanted to be more careful. Mr. Bohnert said that if the further tests showed serious levels of contamination from all the chemicals, not just chlordane, that could indicate that much of the borough might be contaminated. ''If they're not good, it would be a townwide problem,'' he said, since ''the whole town was celery fields'' until suburban development arrived. The piles of dirt were covered by plastic tarps behind a chain link fence, but some blew off at one point last week, he said. Students in the neighborhood said that students in the school's photography club had been taking pictures inside the fence recently. Kunal Malkan, 13, an eighth grader at the school, who was riding his bicycle on his unexpected day off, said: ''I kind of feel unhappy about what's happening. They shut down school, and it's kind of scary.''"
"As many as 85,000 large residential and commercial buildings in New York City lack special valves on their water connections that could prevent hazardous substances from being sucked into the public water system, according to city records. In investigating the presence of a chemical, tetrachloroethylene, in the drinking water supply in parts of Queens last week, city officials identified a car wash as having contributed to the contamination at least partly because it did not have the valve installed on one of its water supply lines. The amount of the contaminant was considered too low to pose a serious health problem. The records also show that about 26,000 buildings in the city represent an especially high risk because factories, gasoline stations or businesses that handle hazardous materials housed in those buildings have not installed the device, called a backflow prevention valve. State law has required that the device be installed on certain categories of buildings since 1981. Critics say the city's lax enforcement of the rules on backflow valves endangers the water system and encourages owners to ignore the law. They also say the city does little to ensure that owners have the valves tested once a year to make sure they are not clogged, as required in the state sanitary code Last year, only 2,085 such tests on the valves were conducted in the city, according to a 2006 report by the Department of Environmental Protection, which operates the city's water system. But fewer than 2,000 violations were issued for the thousands of property owners who failed to conduct the tests, according to the report. City officials admit that compliance goals set by a city industry task force in 2000 have not been met. But they insist that the city's water supply is safe. The backflow prevention valves are generally located near water meters inside commercial, industrial and large residential buildings. They are attached to water lines completely separate from wastewater lines that run to the sewers, and are designed to prevent contaminated water within a building's systems from being drawn back into the water mains. For example, the chemically treated water in a large boiler could flow back into the water supply if water pressure into the building suddenly dropped. The contaminated water then could travel to other buildings. New buildings generally install the devices during construction. One and two family homes are exempt. Stewart O'Brien, executive director of the Plumbing Foundation City of New York, an industry group, said the city's failure to rigorously enforce the rules put thousands of New Yorkers at risk. ''These valves are like sprinkler systems in buildings,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ''If you don't have a fire, it's not an issue. In this case, nobody worries about it unless there's an incident.'' Some businesses object to the high cost of installing the valves, which can be $8,000 to $16,000. For their part, licensed plumbers have a financial interest in seeing the law enforced because they install the valves and perform the yearly inspections. Emily Lloyd, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said that historically, the backflow valve program had not been as high a priority for the department for assuring water quality as its testing and monitoring program. ''But testing is really the way we assure the public of water quality,'' she said. Ms. Lloyd said inspectors regularly test for 280 different substances in the water and conduct more than 300,000 water analyses a year. She also said that the federal Environmental Protection Agency approved of the city's enforcement record for backflow preventers before it recently exempted the city from requirements to filter its upstate water supply for 10 more years. Still, Ms. Lloyd said, the law requires that the drinking water system be adequately protected from backflow episodes. And following the recent contamination in Queens, she said, the department will try to increase the number of inspections it does to determine whether buildings are properly equipped. The Real Estate Board of New York, which represents the owners of many of the largest buildings in the city, has criticized the law requiring the devices as being cumbersome and confusing. Marolyn Davenport, senior vice president of the board and a former member of a backflow prevention task force established by the city, said the numbers of buildings that have installed valves is probably much higher than city records suggest. But she said unclear reporting requirements might have kept many businesses from completing all the steps necessary to be in compliance with the law. ''People routinely don't get things signed off, but that doesn't mean the valve is not there,'' Ms. Davenport said. The chance of contaminated water flowing back into water mains is considered relatively small, though potentially serious. In one of the few reported cases, a school in Queens had air conditioning coolant back up into the drinking water in 1998. But the contamination in Queens this month, detected during routine water testing, underscored the potential danger. Tetrachloroethylene is known to cause liver problems and an increased risk of cancer if consumed over a long period. The city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene did not consider the contamination an immediate health threat because the amount of the chemical found in the water was minute, and the contamination was expected to last only a few days. Still, officials told people who were concerned to use bottled water for cooking and drinking until the problem cleared up. Water samples this week showed no trace of tetrachloroethylene, Ms. Lloyd said. After inspecting hundreds of buildings in the area, officials are focusing on the Cambria Car Wash on Linden Boulevard, which they suspect was at least a partial source of the contamination. Ms. Lloyd said that the car wash drew water from a contaminated well and from two connections to the city water system, one legal and the other illegal. Somehow, the tainted well water crossed over into the illegal connection, which did not have a backflow preventer, and seeped into the water mains. The level of tetrachloroethylene in the well was considered low, however, and officials believe some other source, still unidentified, also contributed to the contamination. Ms. Lloyd said her department was authorized to issue violations and eventually terminate water service to buildings without a backflow prevention device. But records show that in the past 25 years, the city has shut off the water to only three commercial buildings that did not have the valve installed."
"A federal advisory panel recommended Tuesday that thousands of former workers at a nuclear weapons plant be denied immediate government compensation for illnesses that they say result from years of radiation exposure there. The recommendation is a significant setback for a large number of people once employed as plutonium workers at the plant, Rocky Flats, 16 miles northwest of Denver. Their union, the United Steelworkers of America, had petitioned the Department of Health and Human Services to allow more than 3,000 of them to bypass a complex federal evaluation and compensation process established by Congress in 2000. In that time-consuming process, sick workers from Rocky Flats and other American nuclear facilities may apply for $150,000 in compensation, plus medical benefits, if there is evidence that they suffer from any of 22 kinds of cancer linked to radiation. A worker must first file a claim with the Labor Department, a step that brings a lengthy investigation in which scientists from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, through records, research and interviews, determine eligibility by establishing the radiation dose incurred by the worker. If the scientists are unable to determine the dose, the worker may file for ''special exposure cohort'' status. It was this status that was sought by the former Rocky Flats workers. But after more than two years of hearings and debate, the panel -- the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, a unit of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- decided on a vote of 6 to 4 Tuesday that the occupational safety scientists could accurately determine dose exposure for almost all of the plant's former workers. The board did recommend that a relatively small subset of the petitioning workers be allowed to receive the expedited benefits. These workers were exposed from 1959 to 1966, and the panel found that the occupational safety agency could not be expected to establish the dose for so early a period. The board's recommendations now go to the Department of Health and Human Services, though it is unclear when the department will rule. ''I'm stunned,'' said Laura Schultz, a former plutonium worker who has suffered from cervical and kidney cancer. ''We don't have the money to keep fighting for this.'' One panel member, Dr. James Melius, a physician, called the process ''grossly unfair'' and said the board had had little opportunity to review the accounts of the former workers, many of whom argued that the occupational safety agency's records were incomplete and vastly understated their illnesses. But a member who voted with the majority, Mark Griffon, a consultant on radiation and hazardous waste, said he felt that the agency's scientists had proved that they could accurately reconstruct the radiation dose level for most Rocky Flats workers. ''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Griffon said, ''I do feel like we have data.'' Rocky Flats opened in 1952 and ultimately produced more than 60,000 nuclear weapons parts. It was closed in 1989 after a raid by federal agents investigating accusations of environmental crimes on the part of its operator, Rockwell International, an Energy Department contractor. The plant was designated a Superfund hazardous waste site by the Environmental Protection Agency, and a cleanup took place from 1992 to 2005. It is now a wildlife sanctuary. In the absence of expedited benefits, a total of 2,682 Rocky Flats workers have filed claims over their illnesses, the steelworkers union says, with 807 approved and 617 denied. The rest, 1,258, are still pending. On Monday, more than 100 Rocky Flats workers and supporters attended a hearing of the advisory panel in this Denver suburb. Some of them -- burly men with worn faces and white-haired women with slouched shoulders -- told of suffering, and sometimes death, their plain-spoken narratives in sharp contrast to the data-driven discussions of board members. Judy Padilla, who worked as a sheet metal worker at Rocky Flats for 22 years and has since had a mastectomy, told the board: ''We ask neither for sympathy nor charity. All we ask for is the truth.'' Jennifer Thompson, a former Rocky Flats worker who is a spokeswoman for the petitioners, told the panel that it took an average of 742 days to process a successful claim. Sixty-seven workers have died waiting for their benefits to come through, Ms. Thompson said. Charlie Wolf, a former project engineer at the plant who now suffers from brain and bone marrow cancer, said he had waited more than four years before his claim was approved. ''It's hard for me to even read anymore,'' said Mr. Wolf, whose bald head is creased by a nine-inch scar from brain surgery related to his cancer. Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado and all the members of the state's Congressional delegation sent letters asking the panel to support the petition. Representative Mark Udall testified on Monday that the compensation program's red tape left workers in a ''Kafkaesque nightmare.'' Michelle Dobrovolny, 42, is one of 15 family members who worked at Rocky Flats. Four have died of cancer. Five others are sick, among them Ms. Dobrovolny herself, who has a brain tumor. ''We're the forgotten bunch,'' she said. Correction: June 27, 2007, Wednesday An article on June 13 about a more hospitable approach to day laborers taken by the village of Mamaroneck, N.Y., referred imprecisely to the number of hiring sites in the country. According to the National Day Labor Organizing Network, there are approximately 65 formal sites, like the one at the Strait Gate Church in Mamaroneck. But there are hundreds more informal gathering places for day laborers, including street corners and parking lots. (The first nationwide study of day laborers, released in 2006, counted more than 500 sites.)"
"EVERY year, dozens of bills die quiet deaths at the Statehouse. A few carry an unusual poignancy, because they foreshadow the quiet human deaths that could have been prevented had the proposals become law. Two such bills -- one promoting research in less toxic alternatives to industrial materials and the other encouraging employers to use them -- could have saved the lives of several hundred workers in this state. Workplace accidents kill close to 6,000 Americans every year. Health experts estimate that 10 times that many die from work-related illness. Here in Connecticut, we occasionally hear about the sudden, traumatic on-the-job deaths like that of the New Haven police officer who was run over directing traffic last year or the Greenwich country club groundskeeper who died in January when a trench collapsed on him. But the workers who die slowly and prematurely, after years of gradual poisoning, never make the news. Nor did either of the workplace bills, both of which were pronounced dead in committee this spring. The cause of death was lack of interest, worsened by industry opposition. We don't know how many Connecticut workers are getting sick on the job. Examining the most recent available statistics, Tim Morse, a professor at the University of Connecticut, found that the state Labor Department reported more than 4,500 cases of occupational disease in 2004 -- a figure the Department acknowledges is undercounted. Several academic studies have found that federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration records capture only about one in three workplace illnesses and injuries. If you take Mr. Morse's finding of an occupational disease rate of about 30 per 10,000 Connecticut workers and multiply by three to account for underreporting, you get a rate of 0.9 percent per year. That sounds minuscule until you realize that, during a 45-year work life, that rate adds up to about a 33 percent chance of getting sick on the job. Most of those who do become ill will probably never know that their jobs are the cause. Disguised as run-of-the-mill ailments or chalked up to the mysteries of cancer, these sometimes deadly illnesses are usually not diagnosed as work-related; they are not recorded in any official statistics; the victims' families receive no compensation. Most important, no one fixes the fatal work conditions. The bills that died this year would not have ended the problem, but they would have taken a modest first step on a trail being blazed by the European Union. Last week, a new law went into effect that requires companies doing business with the union to show that the chemicals they use or make are safe or that their usefulness outweighs the health risks. Connecticut companies, like everyone else, must comply or face getting shut out of the world's biggest economy. The workplace safety bills would have helped protect local workers' health as well as their employers' access to the European market. If you're thinking that federal rules give Connecticut workers all the protection they need, think again. Most of the OSHA guidelines about exposure to toxic chemicals and metals are based on outdated science. For example, OSHA permits workers to be exposed to up to 1,000 times the concentration of hazardous substances that the Environmental Protection Agency allows in air or water. What's more, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. recently calculated that it would take OSHA inspectors 94 years to visit each Connecticut workplace just once. The same report noted that in 2006, OSHA's average penalty for ''serious'' violations -- those considered likely to cause death or serious injury -- in Connecticut was $767. Such a paltry fine will do nothing to deter employers from endangering their workers' lives. Connecticut should learn from Massachusetts, where companies have been required since 1989 to develop plans to reduce their use of toxic materials. Then we should take the next step and put those plans into effect. Our workers, our economy and our environment will all be healthier. Op-Ed Contributor Carole Bass, a journalist, is writing a book about workplace safety."
"Chinese regulators acknowledged for the first time Thursday that two Chinese companies had ''engaged in some misconduct'' in the way they labeled and sold a poisonous ingredient that ended up in cold medicine, killing at least 100 people in Panama last year. But the regulators said primary responsibility for the deaths rested with traders in Spain and Panama who knew the product was not suitable for use in medicine but sold it for that purpose anyway. Both trading companies dispute that charge. Chinese companies sold the ingredient as 99.5 percent pure glycerin, even though it contained about 24 percent diethylene glycol, a poison commonly used in antifreeze, according to the United States Food and Drug Administration. Chinese authorities also said that Chinese-made toothpaste containing small amounts of diethylene glycol was safe, and that its manufacturer had broken no laws. But officials also said that new controls would be put on the use of the chemical in toothpaste, and that toothpaste sold for export would be tested. Tens of thousands of tubes of tainted Chinese-made toothpaste were recently seized in Panama and at least three other Latin American countries. The F.D.A. is now testing samples of all toothpaste imported into the United States from China. The Chinese government's findings reflect its growing concern over the perception that the country's safety regulations may not have kept up with its booming export economy. American officials recently accused two Chinese companies of intentionally shipping pet food ingredients contaminated with an industrial chemical, melamine, to the United States, leading to one of the largest pet food recalls in history. After initial denials, Beijing officials banned the use of melamine and have promised to improve food safety regulations and export controls. Chinese authorities reopened an investigation of the Panama poisonings in response to a report last month by The New York Times that traced 46 barrels of the mislabeled poison from the Panama port city of Colón through Barcelona, Spain, to a Beijing trading company and finally to its origin at the Taixing Glycerine Factory in the Yangtze Delta. Wei Chuanzhong, the head of investigation and deputy director of the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, acknowledged that the factory had labeled the barrels as glycerin even though they contained significant amounts of diethylene glycol. An official confirmed that they had passed through Chinese customs as glycerin. But Mr. Wei said the manufacturer and its exporter, CNSC Fortune Way in Beijing, had sold the barrels as ''TD'' glycerin -- or substitute glycerin -- for industrial, not medical, use. He further charged that a Panamanian import company, the Medicom Business Group, had altered the paperwork, describing the substance as pharmaceutical grade. Mr. Wei did not explain why the Chinese companies had exported barrels with a false certificate of analysis, listing their content as 99.5 percent glycerin. Both companies remain under investigation, according to Chinese authorities. The F.D.A. said China's explanation sidestepped a critical fact: the deception had begun with the false certificate of analysis. ''If the drums had been 99.5 percent glycerin, the deaths in Panama would never have occurred,'' the agency said. Ascensión Criado, manager of the Spanish trading company Rasfer International, said China was wrong to blame her company. ''We ordered glycerin and they sent us something else,'' she said. Valentín Jaén, a lawyer for Medicom, the Panamanian importer, said, ''The Chinese state has no reason or justification to blame Medicom for anything.'' On Thursday, Nicaragua announced the seizure of more than 40,000 tubes of Chinese-made toothpaste suspected of contamination and that as many as 80,000 tubes of the Excel and Mr. Cool brands might still be on the local market."
"They might be called China's renegade businessmen, small entrepreneurs who are experts at counterfeiting and willing to go to extraordinary lengths to make a profit. But just how far out of the Chinese mainstream are they? Here in Wudi in eastern China, a few companies tried to save money by slipping the industrial chemical melamine into pet food ingredients as a cheap protein enhancer, helping incite one of the largest pet food recalls ever. In Taixing, a city far to the south, a small business cheated the system by substituting a cheap toxic chemical for pharmaceutical-grade syrup, leading to a mass poisoning in Panama. And in the eastern province of Anhui, a group of entrepreneurs concocted a fake baby-milk formula that eventually killed dozens of rural children. The incidents are the latest indications that cutting corners or producing fake goods is not just a legacy of China's initial rush toward the free market three decades ago but still woven into the fabric of the nation's thriving industrial economy. It is driven by entrepreneurs who are taking advantage of a weak legal system, lax regulations and a business culture where bribery and corruption are rampant. ''This is cut-throat market capitalism,'' said Wenran Jiang, a specialist in China who teaches at the University of Alberta. ''But the question has to be asked: is this uniquely Chinese or is there simply a lack of regulation in the market?'' Counterfeiting, of course, is not new to China. Since this country's economic reforms began to take root in the 1980s, businesses have engineered countless ways to produce everything from fake car parts, cosmetics and brand name bags to counterfeit electrical cables and phony Viagra. Counterfeiting rings are broken nearly every week; nonetheless, the government seems to be waging a losing battle against the operations. Dozens of Chinese cities have risen to prominence over the last two decades by first specializing in fake goods, like Wenzhou, which was once known for selling counterfeit Procter & Gamble products, and Kaihua in Zhejiang province, which specialized in fake Philips light bulbs. For a time, people even derided the entire province of Henan as the capital of substandard or fake goods, like medicines that could make you miraculously grow taller. But the discovery of dangerous ingredients in foods and drugs has raised more serious questions. One such operation is centered here in Wudi, about five hours southeast of Beijing. This is where the trail of the American pet food recall leads. Regulators came to Wudi in early May and shut down one of the region's biggest feed exporters, the Binzhou Futian Biology Technology Company. They also detained its manager, Tian Feng, after American officials identified Binzhou Futian as one of two Chinese companies responsible for shipping contaminated pet food ingredients to the United States. Chinese authorities said that Binzhou Futian and a company in bordering Jiangsu province had intentionally doctored feed ingredients to generate bigger profits. Regulators in China called it an isolated incident. But agricultural workers and experts in this region tell a different story. They say the practice of doctoring animal and fish feed with melamine and other ingredients is widespread in China. And Wudi, they say, has long been known as a center for such activity. ''Wudi became famous for fake fish powder almost 10 years ago,'' said Chen Baojiang, a professor of animal nutrition at the Agricultural University of Hebei. (Fish powder is used as a protein additive to animal feed, including fish feed.) ''All kinds of fillers have been used. At the beginning it was vegetable protein, then urea. Now it's feather powder.'' In small village workshops on the outskirts of Wudi, residents say hundreds of workers make animal feed doctored with fish scraps and cheap ingredients that are then packaged for sale to unsuspecting farmers and fish farms. Much of the fish scrap comes from the nearby Bohai Bay area or imported from Peru and then blended with cheap fillers to bolster profits. ''About 90 percent of the fish powder on the market is fake,'' said Xue Min, who works at the Feed Research Institute, a division of the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. ''When it reaches the customer, he doesn't know how many kinds of filler have been added.'' But recently, residents say more buyers have turned skeptical of Wudi's fish powder. And that has forced some local manufacturers to switch to vegetable protein and search for new buyers. ''Customers are now suspicious about fish powder,'' says Sun Hong Qiang, who operates a fish scrap supplier in Wudi. ''Everyone knows there's some fake fish powder out there.'' To reach bigger customers, feed producers from Wudi recently began calling themselves ''technology'' companies that sell protein powder. And they are using online trading Web sites like Alibaba.com to sell their goods. But few companies here were as successful as Binzhou Futian, which in 2006 won contracts to ship pet food ingredients to major suppliers in the United States and South Africa. The American and South African middlemen say that they found Binzhou Futian through online advertisements and commodity-trading Web sites. The companies did not bother to visit Binzhou's factories or to investigate its background or its export record. ''I'm not sure of the introduction, but I think it was through Google search,'' said Leon Ekermans, a marketing director at Bester Feed and Grain, a South African grain trader. ''We were told by an intermediary that they were once a government company and made good feed.'' Asked whether Bester had researched the supplier's record or visited China, Mr. Ekermans acknowledged that the answer was no. ''We tested samples,'' he said, ''but it was very difficult to test for melamine.'' When investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration visited China in early May, hoping to determine why melamine ended up in pet food ingredients, they saw little more than a shuttered Binzhou Futian factory. ''They've all been closed down, machinery dismantled, nothing to get access to,'' said Walter Batts, an F.D.A. official. Binzhou Futian was run by Tian Feng, a small-town entrepreneur who started out producing fish powder but later moved into vegetable protein, according to local residents. Mr. Tian's company shared a building with the county government's cereal and grains bureau, an indication of its close ties to the government. ''Futian didn't have any actual factory here,'' said a guard who works at the Binzhou headquarters. ''They hung a banner here because they wanted to look good in front of visitors. They had countless suppliers from the countryside.'' A spokesman for the county cereal bureau, however, denied having any relationship with Binzhou Futian and Mr. Tian, who has been detained by the authorities. Mr. Tian has denied knowing anything about melamine or how it got into the feed he exported. And while the government said that it had not found any other companies exporting melamine-tainted goods overseas, regulators shut dozens of fish feed producers near Wudi. Investigators say Mr. Tian's company engaged in fraud: it mislabeled its feed exports as nonfeed goods, possibly to avoid food inspection; it also exported tons of pet food ingredients labeled as corn gluten and rice protein concentrate. Actually, they say, it was low-protein wheat powder. Analysts say Binzhou's case is not unusual. This is how the counterfeiting system often evolves, they say. For decades, small entrepreneurs have started out counterfeiting in emerging industries in China, seeking an early advantage and their first pot of gold. Often, they try to get around regulations, or simply believe small-time cheating that involves adding cheap substitutes or low-grade ingredients will not cause much harm. ''Basically, for entrepreneurs, if something is not explicitly banned -- it's not banned,'' said Dali Yang, who teaches at the University of Chicago and has studied China's food safety regulations. ''As long as people are not sick or dying, it's O.K.'' Experts say counterfeiters are now moving to outlying areas of the country, where it is easier to evade regulation. The counterfeiters are also moving into food and agriculture, which are difficult to monitor because they involve small farmers and entrepreneurs. Small-time entrepreneurs have played the same game over and over with other products, experts say, adding cheap substitute chemicals to toothpaste; using lower-grade materials to produce car parts, batteries and cellphones; and creating factories that specialize in counterfeit goods. Last year, for instance, pirates were caught faking an entire company, setting up a ''branch'' of the NEC Corporation of Japan, including 18 factories and warehouses in China and Taiwan. ''We have to bear in mind they probably don't think about the consequences at all,'' said Steve Tsang, a China specialist who teaches at Oxford University. ''They're probably only thinking of making a fast buck.''"
"Ron Lacroix has been fishing the waters of southeast New Hampshire -- Mendums Pond, Swains Lake, Bow Lake, Spruce Pond -- for a little less than half a century. He has made endless meals of fresh-caught black crappie, bass, and smelts and has been the host of endless fish fries. So he was not pleased to find that his fishing grounds and fish contain high levels of mercury, a neurotoxin. These lakes are nestled in one of the country's best-documented mercury ''hot spots,'' places with high concentration levels that experts believe probably come from the emissions of local power plants or other facilities, like incinerators. ''You're worrying me,'' Mr. Lacroix said, when told that some of his favorite lakes were among those on the state government's list. Last week the Environmental Protection Agency issued a rule to limit mercury emissions from power plants. But rather than requiring across-the-board cuts in emissions it gave companies the ability to buy and sell pollution allowances. In the short run, some plants could buy allowances from cleaner companies and delay making large expenditures to cut emissions. New Hampshire is one of the places that could be left to grapple with the emissions problem itself if local power plants -- chiefly the Bow plant of the local utility, Public Service of New Hampshire -- uses the flexibility the environmental agency granted last week to postpone a cleanup of what in 2003 was 116 pounds of mercury coursing upward from their stacks and raining down on the lands and waters to the southeast. The Bow plant, known locally as the Merrimack plant for the river nearby, is one of hundreds in the country that, collectively, put out 48 tons of mercury annually, making them the largest single remaining source of airborne emissions of the toxic metal. In the 1990's federal regulation reduced emissions from other sources, like municipal incinerators. Senior environmental agency officials said the economics of their approach would encourage the largest polluters to move first to control mercury. In addition, the new rule allows the states to issue more stringent regulations, or even ban their utilities from participating in the trading of pollution allowances. The State Senate is expected to vote Thursday on whether New Hampshire is going to choose one or both of those options. Certainly, the testimony of a local utility official at a State Senate committee hearing last week indicated that the utility would be cautious about taking aggressive clean up measures on its own. ''We're not afraid of taking action,'' said William H. Smagula of Public Service of New Hampshire. ''We just want to take action when there's known science.'' Speaking against the proposed legislation, which would put New Hampshire's cleanup timetable 10 years ahead of the E.P.A.'s, Mr. Smagula said, ''The only thing we know is that we'll spend a lot of money.'' ''We don't know how much we will spend or what results we will achieve,'' Mr. Smagula added. He did not specifically address whether Public Service of New Hampshire would choose to buy pollution credits. In a later telephone interview, the company's spokesman, Martin Murray, indicated it could meet the first of the environmental agency's two deadlines without taking on improvements beyond those already under way. Mr. Murray added that the state's utility regulators once investigated the company when it adopted expensive cleanup tools that achieved results beyond those that were legally required. Worries about hot spots, like southeast New Hampshire, were one of the chief arguments marshaled by environmental groups against allowing the trading of credits. Unlike nitrogen oxide or sulfur dioxide, the mercury emitted from power plants is a toxin for which there are no other general, national or region-wide controls. At least two epidemiological studies have shown that mercury can hurt neurological and cognitive development in infants; one more recent study suggests it might be implicated in heart attacks. New England is more than familiar with mercury and other pollutants from coal-fired power plants. ''We're at the end of the national tailpipe,'' said Matt Prindiville an environmentalist with the Natural Resources Council of Maine, at the hearing. ''Mercury levels are high and persistent in New England,'' David C. Evers, a scientist with the Maine-based Biodiversity Research Institute, told the Senate committee. Dr. Evers specializes in studies of mercury in loons, a fish-eating, lake-dwelling bird beloved by many New Englanders. One of these is Carl R. Johnson, the 83-year-old Republican state senator who is chairman of the Environment and Wildlife Committee and also a member of the policy board of the Loon Preservation Committee, a private group. Scientific studies by Dr. Evers and others, in the latest issue of the journal Ecotoxicology, thoroughly document, through loon and fish studies, the unusually high level of mercury pollution in this region. But it is harder to document their source. ''Mercury is a very tricky pollutant because it transports and it pollutes locally,'' said Jeff Underhill, a scientist with the State Department of Environmental Services. Mr. Underhill told the committee that 90 percent of the emissions responsible for a separate hot spot in northern New Hampshire come from out of state. But, he added, ''the closer you get to our sources, the lower the overall out-of-state percentage.'' Downwind of a power plant, he added, as much as 80 to 90 percent of the mercury deposits can come from that single source. Mr. Smagula of Public Service said he was skeptical. ''A large volume of data is based on analytical assumptions and conclusions,'' he told the committee. ''We don't do business on the basis of analytical assumptions and conclusions.'' The measure, as approved by the committee last week, requires that mercury emissions from power plants be cut to 50 pounds annually by 2008 -- 10 years ahead of the E.P.A.'s timetable for New Hampshire. By 2010, maximum emissions would be 24 pounds. In response to the testimony of Nancy Girard, vice president of the Conservation Law Foundation's New Hampshire Advocacy Center, the committee approved an amendment to the bill that would prohibit the emissions trading. Even if the State Legislature decides to take that route, it is not clear how quickly mercury levels would drop in local waters and the fish within them. Fishermen like Mr. Lacroix are concerned, but he at least has not changed his ways. ''You don't want to know how many fish I've eaten from those ponds,'' Mr. Lacroix said in an interview. The black crappie he caught in Round Pond, downwind from the plant near Patuckway state park, ''almost had a metallic taste to them. They had a taste that was different.'' But, while Mr. Lacroix, a meat cutter, worries, he has not cut back on his fish consumption. ''I eat more fish than most people do,'' he said. ''I probably eat it two, three times a week.'' Art Cunningham, a retired lawyer who volunteers with the Conservation Law Foundation's New Hampshire office, fishes for fun and throws back his catches, but is also concerned about mercury contamination. When Mr. Cunningham went fishing recently in Rollins Pond, he saw a new sign. ''There was this mercury warning sign -- fish consumption can be dangerous,'' he said. ''My immediate reaction was: Isn't that a shame. A beautiful rural spot, a pretty pond, and it's got dangerous levels of mercury.''"
"Ten months ago, government safety officials warned that more than half of the nation's 60,000 pressurized rail tank cars did not meet industry standards, and they raised questions about the safety of the rest of the fleet as well. Their worry, that the steel tanks could rupture too easily in an accident, proved prophetic. On Thursday, a train crash in South Carolina caused a deadly release of chlorine: 9 people were killed, 58 were hospitalized and hundreds more sought treatment. The ninth body was found yesterday, and thousands of people have been kept from their homes. [Page 18.] Last summer, a derailment in Texas caused a steel tank car to break open, spewing clouds of chlorine gas that killed three people. The exact causes of the accidents are still under investigation. But the devastation they have wrought shows why tank cars have become an increasing concern not just to safety investigators but also to domestic security officials worried that terrorists could turn tank cars into lethal weapons. The Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in 2002 that Al Qaeda might be planning to attack trains in the United States, possibly causing derailments or blowing up tank cars laden with hazardous materials. And after bombings on commuter trains killed 191 people in Spain last March, security officials secretly persuaded one railroad to reroute toxic shipments that had routinely passed within four blocks of the Capitol in Washington, government officials said. Federal authorities have been working with railroads and the chemical industry to improve security for trains. But there is still much to be done, particularly given the structural weaknesses of many tank cars, current and former federal officials say. George Gavalla, a former associate administrator for safety at the Federal Railroad Administration, said railroads had promised to beef up security when there was a credible terrorist threat. So when such a threat arose a year ago in Las Vegas, Mr. Gavalla said, he sent an inspector there on New Year's Eve to assess the security measures in place. Those measures, he said, were virtually nonexistent. When the inspector visited a rail yard 13 miles from the airport, he found no one watching over six tank cars with markings indicating that they might contain chlorine gas, according to a memorandum that he wrote about his visit. Two hours later, he visited another rail yard with four tank cars possibly carrying poisonous gas and they, too, were unguarded, the memorandum stated. Finally, Mr. Gavalla said, the inspector visited a rail yard near several hotels. ''None of the train crew members challenged me or even talked to me,'' the inspector wrote. A spokesman for the railroad administration declined to comment. Railroad officials have said they have taken many steps to improve security. Nancy L. Wilson, a senior vice president of the Association of American Railroads, said in a statement about the same time as the inspection that the railroads had ''tightened security and intensified inspections across their systems.'' Police forces employed by the major railroads, Ms. Wilson said, had ''put into place more than 50 countermeasures to ensure the security of the industry.'' Just how ruptured tank cars can endanger a community was underscored three years ago when a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailed just outside Minot, N.D. Five tank cars carrying a liquefied type of ammonia gas broke open, releasing toxic fumes that killed one resident and injured more than 300. The National Transportation Safety Board, in a report on the accident released last year, said the steel shells on the five ruptured tank cars had become brittle, causing a ''catastrophic fracture'' that released clouds of toxic vapors. Those cars, the safety board found, were built before 1989 using steel that did not -- as it does now -- undergo a special heat treatment to make it stronger and less brittle. Tank cars built after 1989 use this specially treated steel. The safety board warned that of the 60,000 pressurized tank cars in operation, more than half were older cars that were not built according to current industry standards, leaving them susceptible to rupture. And because these cars may remain in service for up to 50 years, some older ones could still be hauling hazardous materials until 2039. Among the hazardous materials carried by the tank cars are liquefied ammonia, chlorine, propane and vinyl chloride. In most cases, the cars are owned by chemical or leasing companies, not the railroads. ''We are required to carry this stuff,'' said Kathryn Blackwell, a spokeswoman for Union Pacific, the nation's biggest railroad. ''We'd rather not in many cases, but this is one of the things we would like chemical companies to be responsible for.'' Although the rail industry now requires that tank shells be made with the special heat-treated steel, the safety board said that treatment alone ''does not guarantee'' enough protection against impact. Other manufacturing techniques should also be explored, the board said, but it cautioned that the industry and the railroad administration ''have not established adequate testing standards to measure the impact resistance for steels and other materials used in the construction of pressure tank cars.'' Steven W. Kulm, a spokesman for the railroad administration, said, ''We have a long history of activities and actions that have improved the integrity of tank car construction.'' Mr. Kulm said that since 1994 accidents ''have been few in number,'' though even one death, he added, was too many. ''Tank cars are more crashworthy and puncture resistant in train derailments today than ever before,'' he said. In the Texas crash last summer, the tank car that ruptured and released poisonous gas was made before 1989, though federal investigators have not yet concluded whether brittle steel played a role in that accident. The South Carolina crash involved the rupture of a newer tank car manufactured in 1993, said Richard Koch, vice president for public affairs at the Olin Corporation, a diversified manufacturing company that owned the car. Mr. Koch said that tanker was recertified to carry hazardous materials last June. Investigators have just begun exploring why the tank car ruptured and whether any federal safety standards or recommendations were ignored. Railroad and chemical executives formed a task force to study the safety board recommendations, and it has been conducting crash tests on about a dozen tank cars. Michael E. Lyden, the vice president for storage and transport at the Chlorine Institute, a trade group in Arlington, Va., said the leading companies were ''working in a cooperative manner to improve the pressure vessels.'' Industry officials said the group could recommend the retirement of cars made by certain manufacturers or suggest that some types of cars carry less hazardous materials. Security experts said the recent accidents also illustrated the harm that terrorists could cause if they attacked trains carrying highly toxic substances. Some cars are also used to store chemicals at water treatment, sewage and industrial plants. ''Whether it's an accident or Al Qaeda, these hazardous materials are very vulnerable and pose a great risk to densely populated areas,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has pushed for greater rail security. The danger of such an attack has been a major concern since the Sept. 11 strikes. When the United States invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, freight railroads placed a 72-hour moratorium on carrying some hazardous chemicals as a precaution against retaliatory strikes. In warning in 2002 about possible attacks, the F.B.I. said, ''Recently captured Al Qaeda photographs of U.S. railroad engines, cars and crossings heightens the intelligence community's concern of this threat.'' The fears have been most evident among local officials in Washington, some of whom have pushed for a year to ban toxic rail shipments though the capital. An expert from the Naval Research Laboratory testified last January that more than 100,000 people could be at risk of death or injury if one of the tank cars exploded there. Federal and railroad officials have opposed a ban, saying that rerouting the shipments could lengthen transits and upset other communities. But late last year, officials from the Department of Homeland Security told congressmen that after the Madrid bombings they quietly asked the CSX Corporation, a leading railroad, to shift some of the shipments away from Washington, Mr. Markey said. The officials also said they were working on a $6 million security plan that would increase surveillance of 42 miles of railroad track in the Washington area. The District of Columbia Council rejected the proposal for a ban last November. But Kathy Patterson, a District of Columbia councilwoman, said in an interview that last week's accident in South Carolina should increase the chances that the Council would approve the ban when it reconsidered the matter early next month. ''Frankly, the horrific news out of South Carolina underscores that these really are nasty chemicals,'' Ms. Patterson said, ''and that could make a difference with my colleagues, especially given the extent that we are vulnerable here.'' Since last August, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation have been looking at whether to require greater security for toxic rail shipments nationwide. The agencies have said they are considering several possible measures, including better identification and tracking of the most toxic substances and ''strengthened tank car integrity.'' But Rick Hind, a toxics specialist at Greenpeace, the environmental group, said that the best answer would be for industrial plants to substitute less toxic substances for chlorine and other hazardous materials. Safer technologies have emerged in some areas, Mr. Hind said, and switching to them would reduce the sense that the plants and trains are ''a target-rich environment.''"
"Now that the holidays are over, we find ourselves wondering what the happy owners of new computers and televisions did with their old models. This is not idle curiosity. Unless these electronic devices are redeployed as coffee tables, they might wind up as trash on the streets of New York. That is not illegal -- although it should be. E-waste, as it is known, is toxic. It is also the next big challenge in managing the city's mountain of garbage. A computer monitor or TV can contain seven pounds of lead, buried beneath the screen. Usually there are various amounts of two other heavy metals, mercury and cadmium, in the cathode ray tube or in components like circuit boards. Cellphone batteries contain some of the same pollutants. Many discarded electronic devices end up with the regular trash at an incinerator in New Jersey, where they can produce toxic fumes. Or they are taken to a landfill, where pollutants leach into the soil. Within two years, there may be 500 million obsolete computers in the United States, many of them here. Add to that the televisions orphaned with the proliferation of flat-screen models, and you begin to get the picture. The city has addressed the problem in a limited way, by, for example, sponsoring recycling events with equipment makers Dell and Lexmark. One event on Staten Island last fall retrieved five tons of electronics. But by one estimate, there are more than 75,000 tons of personal computers discarded yearly in the city and that doesn't count those stored by owners who would like to get rid of them. A bigger push is needed. Mayor Michael Bloomberg seemed to acknowledge that when he called for an initiative for electronics recycling in his solid waste management plan last year, a good first step, especially coming on the heels of the example the mayor has set on other recyclables. His decision to restore programs to recycle glass, plastics and metals was good for both the environment and the economy. The City Council is taking its own lead on e-waste and is working on recycling legislation that may call on the Department of Sanitation to schedule several special pickup days for electronics. That promises to be a useful element in a wider solution. New York can learn what not to do by studying California's struggles with an e-waste recycling program, which it finances with an upfront fee of as much as $10 on the purchase of televisions, PC's and other devices. The program has created a whole new bureaucracy and a process so inconvenient it may be discouraging participation. A better approach may be to hold manufacturers responsible for the products they produce. Some companies do have programs to take back computers, although they charge the consumer. Maine -- taking a cue from European countries and Canada -- requires municipalities to help collect the items for delivery to a consolidator, who manages the recycling and bills the manufacturers. Besides providing a way to keep poisons from the air, soil and water, this system might also encourage a more intelligent and less toxic design of our machines. E-waste deserves urgent attention. In the meantime, New Yorkers need to do their part and resist the urge to just dump stuff on the street. We recommend that consumers explore recycling options. One way is to go to www.nycwasteless.org and examine its lists of manufacturers' take-back programs for old computers. The City"
"Amid the blur of travelers in the lobby of the Ramada Plaza Hotel at Kennedy International Airport in Queens, 13 men have taken up permanent residence, padding around like caged bobcats. They banter with hotel workers and pass the days loitering in the lobby, picking at the lunch buffet or watching cable TV in their rooms. The men are merchant seamen: eight crew members from the Philippines, one from Russia and four officers from Greece. They have lived here all expenses paid for the past month, detained indefinitely by the federal government. They are not accused of being terrorists or illegal immigrants or criminals. Rather, they are material witnesses in an investigation into whether their ship, a tanker called the Fair Voyager, illegally dumped oil into the ocean before arriving in New York Harbor from Spain on Nov. 21. Authorities seized the ship that day for inspection, and the men were ordered to stay on board, several seamen said. On Dec. 21, the men were handcuffed, taken off the ship, photographed, fingerprinted and brought before a judge. They were told they would be detained pending a Justice Department investigation, so they could testify before a grand jury determining whether the shipping company should be charged with environmental crimes. The men were taken to the Ramada off the Van Wyck Expressway, which has spacious conference halls, a sunken bar and a small dance floor. They have been there ever since, paired up in small rooms on the fifth floor. In the room shared by Robert Roquite, 32, and Ricardo Noya, 45, engine room workers, the shelf space is covered with Bibles, energy bars, cans of tinned meat and buffet vouchers. Mr. Roquite sat on his bed on Thursday and stared out at the Belt Parkway. He said the detention has kept him from his two young sons and his infant daughter, born in September, and has strained his marriage. ''At first, I did not tell my wife I'm a prisoner, for fear she would think I was a drug smuggler,'' Mr. Roquite said on Thursday. ''Then I told her, 'They call us witnesses and don't tell us when we can leave.''' Mr. Noya watched professional wrestling on TV. He said the vessel was seized by the Coast Guard near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Dozens of Coast Guard officers in body armor and carrying automatic weapons swarmed the ship, he said, and put the 13 seamen into a Coast Guard vessel. They were handcuffed and jailed for a day before seeing a judge. After arriving at the Ramada, Mr. Noya said, he called his wife and 17-year-old son and told them he had to wait to testify. Weeping, he added, ''I didn't promise them anything about coming home.'' Down in the lobby restaurant, the Greek officers ate lunch. ''Everything is strange for us because we don't understand the process,'' said Stelios Charonitakis, 48, a chief mate on the Fair Voyager. ''I've spent my life on ships,'' said Mr. Charonitakis, a 30-year veteran seaman from Crete. ''I've never been in a courtroom. It's no vacation for us, but what are we going to do? We are not in prison. We're just waiting.'' The Greek officers have become friends of a Greek waiter, George Vatsis, 57. ''It is ridiculous to keep them here at an airport hotel,'' Mr. Vatsis said, stopping at the table. ''It's a good hotel but it is the most difficult place to live in the U.S.A. They go up and down the elevator all day long. Mentally, it's torture.'' Seafarers advocates say such cases of detaining merchant mariners as material witnesses of environmental crimes have increased in recent months, as prosecution of polluters has stepped up. (They point to a crew of 13 Philippine seafarers who have been held near Long Beach Harbor in California since September.) While acknowledging the need to secure witnesses, advocates say that the federal government drags out the detentions and gives no information to the seamen or anyone else. Advocates say the detentions violate longstanding maritime law and conventions, and they want guidelines for detention times. They note that some companies stop paying salaries and will not pay hotel costs; in those cases the seamen are held in immigration jails. ''These are innocent witnesses of an alleged crime being hauled into court in shackles,'' said Douglas B. Stevenson, 56, a retired Coast Guard commander who is director of the Center for Seafarers' Rights, with the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey, which last month posted news of the detention on its Web site. ''Just having them there is a pressure tactic of the government,'' said Mr. Stevenson. ''The longer you keep them away from their homeland, in an unfamiliar environment, the sooner they're going to break.'' Capt. Glenn A. Wiltshire, commander of Coast Guard Activities New York and captain of the Port of New York and New Jersey, said that Coast Guard officers conducting a routine inspection on the Fair Voyager found ''indications of a possible illegal discharge of oil.'' This was probably oil and water that routinely leak into a ship's bilge that operators are required to pump out while in port, he said. Coast Guard officials notified the United States attorney's office in the Southern District, escorted the seamen to shore and turned them over to United States marshals. Reached for comment last night, Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District, in Manhattan, said, ''As a matter of policy, we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing investigation.'' Tom Russo, a lawyer for the Greek shipping company Fair Deal, which operates the Fair Voyager, said the company was voluntarily paying the seamen's salaries and living expenses. ''The crew and company did nothing wrong, and we're optimistic that when all facts come out, they'll be no charges,'' he said. He said that justice officials had given him no appearance date yet, adding, ''If it continues much longer, we will go to federal court and ask a judge to release them as criminal witnesses.'' ''These men shouldn't be arrested as if they're criminals,'' he said. Asked about a possible oil spill, he said, ''There are no charges of that, and the company operates its vessel in a safe and legal manner.'' Mr. Noya said that while no one was preventing them from going out during the day, the men were leery of doing so. ''It's dangerous to go out,'' he said. ''If the police catch us, they'll take us to jail because we are 100 percent illegal. We have no papers, no visa, no passport, nothing.'' The Rev. Virginia Gonzalez, 58, a Christian pastor with the Seamen's Church Institute and the Adonai Seafarers' Fellowship in Red Hook, Brooklyn, has begun sending a van to take the men sightseeing in Brooklyn, to Philippine churches, to thrift shops for clothing and to restaurants. ''They're not being tortured, but it's mental torture,'' she said. She said that last year she helped a crew of 14 Honduran seamen detained in a Staten Island hotel for months to testify about conditions on their cargo ship. ''The shipping company was paying the bill daily and was always late, so every day the men had to pack their bags and wait in the parking lot until the bill was paid,'' she said. ''They got no wages, only a plane ticket back home.'' The Philippine men, with their compact builds and Tagalog conversation, are easy to pick out from the business travelers and flight crews wheeling luggage into the Ramada. Most live out of a single duffel bag and wash their clothes in the tub. They are amazed that French fries are offered three meals a day; they miss their plain white rice. ''The hard part is not knowing when we can leave,'' said Mr. Noya. ''But I still feel the American government is honest,'' he said. ''We love this country.''"
"Once they were coveted technological marvels. But now so many outdated computers, television sets and other pieces of electronic equipment just get thrown into the trash in New York that the City Council is considering what would be one of the toughest laws in the nation to force manufacturers to take the discarded devices back. A bill is expected to be introduced today that would require producers to collect and recycle the electronic devices if they want to be allowed to continue selling them in the city. Electronic devices are a mounting concern because they can contain potentially toxic substances like lead, mercury and chromium. The federal Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 70 percent of the heavy metals in landfills leach from electronic equipment. A traditional computer monitor can contain as much as four pounds of lead that can be released if the screen is shattered, Council officials said. Although electronic waste now accounts for less than 1 percent of the city's residential trash, officials say they think that number will grow dramatically because many old computers and other pieces of equipment are being hoarded in basements and closets and will eventually be discarded. Officials say that only about 10 percent of this growing mound of electronic waste is recycled. ''This bill is an environmentally sound way to handle the explosion of 'e-waste' by imposing producer responsibility for what they sell,'' said Councilman Michael E. McMahon of Staten Island, the chairman of the Sanitation Committee, and a sponsor of the bill along with Speaker Gifford Miller and Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn. Mr. McMahon, who said he had three old computers in his office closet and two more in the attic at home, said that recycling tons of electronic equipment would also save New Yorkers money on disposal costs. He said the new law would be an integral part of the solid waste management plan that the city is putting together. But the new law is unlikely to be passed without a fight from manufacturers and retailers, who agree that something must be done about old computers but worry that it will be impossible to comply with a patchwork of laws. Four states have already passed legislation, and bills have been introduced in more than 20 others. ''We actually support a recycling initiative by government but in our view, it should be a national standard,'' said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association, which represents manufacturers and some retailers. Mr. Shapiro said the proposed New York City law seemed ''pretty onerous,'' and he said he was surprised that it did not force retailers to share responsibility with manufacturers for taking back outdated electronic devices, which would be similar to the current system for recycling beverage bottles. But unlike the bottle law, which imposes a five-cent deposit per container, the new electronics bill specifically prohibits manufacturers from imposing any fees on consumers to cover the cost of recycling. Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council who helped draft the electronics recycling bill, said forcing manufacturers to take responsibility for their products, as they do in Europe, would encourage them to use fewer toxins and to design devices that could be more easily reused. ''Right now, manufacturers have no financial incentive to design products that facilitate reuse,'' Mr. Izeman said. Under the proposed law, manufacturers would have to submit a plan for collecting and recycling old equipment to the Sanitation Department by 2008. By 2010, the manufacturers would have to collect the equivalent of 30 percent of the equipment they sell. To help meet those goals, manufacturers that donate usable second-hand computers or other equipment to schools or nonprofit groups would get extra credits. Manufacturers would also be responsible for handling computers made by companies that no longer exist. Some computer makers already run their own recycling programs. Dell gives every buyer of a new computer the option of mailing back an old computer free, regardless of the maker. A Dell spokeswoman, Caroline B. Dietz, said that for a $10 fee, the company is also willing to accept an old computer from someone who is not buying a new one."
"A Chemical Exposed Polybrominated diphenyl ethers, the flame retardants better known as PBDE's, have been causing concern among health and environmental experts for the better part of a decade, since a Swedish study first showed that the chemicals accumulate in breast milk. PBDE's have been widely used in electronics and furniture, and although the health effects on people are still a subject of debate, production of two types has been banned in Europe. In the United States, where more recent studies have found even higher levels of the chemicals in tissues than in Europe, the main manufacturer has voluntarily stopped making the two types. Still, there are a lot of PBDE's around. And one question for researchers has been exactly how people are exposed to them. Although PBDE's get into outdoor air through manufacturing, many scientists have suspected that dust particles in indoor air are the more likely culprit. A new study led by Miriam Diamond, a geography professor at the University of Toronto, confirms the suspicions. Using a computer model and measures of PBDE concentrations in air in the Toronto area, the study, being published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, shows that household dust is the main source of human exposure, followed by consumption of meat and dairy products. Drinking water is not a significant source of the chemicals. PBDE's get into indoor air through normal wear and tear of foam cushions and fabrics and other treated household products. Toddlers are highly susceptible to PBDE exposure because they tend to put things in their mouths. Undercover Butterflies The peacock butterfly, which is found in Europe and Asia, has a two-pronged strategy for avoiding becoming a bird's lunch. One could be termed a passive approach: when its wings are folded, only the dark undersides are visible, making the butterfly look for all the world like a leaf. So it sits there hoping a yellowhammer, blue tit or other hungry bird will overlook it. If a bird does approach, however, the peacock butterfly springs into active mode. It unfolds its wings, revealing spectacular coloring on the top side, including two sets of what look like eyes. The butterfly usually then flicks its wings open and closed, producing hissing and clicking sounds as veins on the wings rub together. It's been thought that this active defense -- a version of ''call my bluff'' in which the butterfly tries to intimidate the bird -- must be effective at keeping birds at bay. A new study by scientists at Stockholm University and the University of St. Andrews in Scotland shows just how effective it is. The study appears in Proceedings B of the Royal Society. The researchers altered peacock butterflies by masking their eye spots or removing the sound-producing veins, or both. Then they exposed these and unaltered butterflies to the blue tits. All but one of the butterflies with intact eye spots survived, while most of those with masked eye spots were caught by the birds. Whether the butterfly was capable of making sounds or not had no effect on survival, though the researchers point out that the combination of sight and sound may be effective with other predator species. Further Into the Night Sky The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has peered deep into a swath of the night sky over the last five years, precisely measuring several hundred million stars, galaxies and other objects, is about to enter a new phase. The project, which is operated by a consortium of universities and other institutions and uses a telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, has announced financing for its second phase, to continue through summer 2008. The goal of SDSS-II, as the new phase of the survey is known, is to conclude measurements of perhaps a million more galaxies and quasars in the study area, create a detailed map of the Milky Way galaxy and search for supernovas. An Ideal Place to Raise a Barnacle Even for barnacles, apparently, it's all about location. Researchers at Oregon State University have shown that there are coastal hot spots where barnacles reproduce at much higher rates than elsewhere. The finding has implications for conservation efforts, particularly the design of marine reserves. ''For many years most folks have assumed that the ocean is pretty well mixed,'' said Jane Lubchenco, a professor of zoology and an author of a paper describing the finding in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. On the Oregon coast, she said, the assumption has been that ''one place is pretty much the same as the other in terms of the water in the near-shore.'' But earlier research by her and others has shown that differences in oceanography and currents can make one area quite unlike another, especially in the amount of plankton and other primary food sources in the water. For instance, on the central Oregon coast, Cape Perpetua has large amounts of plankton, so the intertidal zone is home to barnacles, mussels and other plankton eaters. Fifty miles to the north, however, at Cape Foulweather, there is little plankton, and seaweed dominates. The current research shows another effect that different conditions can have. It was conducted at the two capes largely by a graduate student, Heather M. Leslie, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton. She painstakingly counted egg production by female barnacles and found that those at Cape Perpetua produced many times the number of eggs than those at Cape Foulweather. At Cape Perpetua, Dr. Lubchenco said, ''the barnacles have a lot more food, are growing a lot faster and have much greater reproduction.'' There is more food, she said, because off the cape the current encounters a seamount, creating a circular pattern that probably concentrates the plankton. Dr. Lubchenco said that barnacle larvae, like those of many other marine invertebrates and fish, drift and settle elsewhere. So in designing marine reserves, productive areas like Cape Perpetua could serve as sources of organisms that would then settle in other parts of the reserve. ''Knowledge of what kinds of places are going to be useful as sources is critically important,'' she said. HENRY FOUNTAIN Observatory"
"Peeking out just past the rooftops of neat two- and three-story homes in the Ironbound section here are the smokestacks of the factories that gird the neighborhood. Residents, many of them immigrants from Portugal, or from Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America, say they feel smothered by the factories, which include paint and chemical manufacturers. Although the huge pastel pink, blue and silver garbage incinerator nearby on Raymond Boulevard barely stands out, they say, they want less waste -- not more. ''Why can't New York burn its own garbage?'' said Vanesa Rodriguez, 23, an immigrant from Portugal pushing her daughter in a stroller. ''The air here is bad, really bad.'' Another resident, Krystyna Fitzsimmons, 57, spoke of the ''different strange smells over here: an acid smell, a fish smell, a diaper smell.'' ''Whatever they're burning over there, it's up in the air,'' she said, referring to the incinerator. ''What we're breathing, I don't know.'' The plant burns about 930,000 tons of garbage a year, said Scott Cunningham, a manager at American Ref-Fuel, which owns it. Some 420,000 tons come from New York City, Mr. Cunningham said, adding that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 20-year plan, which the City Council rejected on Wednesday, would have raised the amount of waste New York sent to the Ironbound to 500,000 tons a year. Arnold Cohen, who directs the Ironbound Committee Against Toxic Waste, called the Council's action a ''success.'' ''The incinerator is already polluting the neighborhood enough,'' he said. Ana Baptista, who teaches a class on environmental issues in urban areas at Rutgers University, gives what she calls a Toxic Tour of the Ironbound. Besides the trash incinerator there are the refineries and smelters along Doremus Avenue, long known as Chemical Row. There's the Diamond Superfund site, 66,000 cubic yards of dioxin-contaminated soil that includes the grounds where the Diamond Alkali Company produced 1 million gallons of Agent Orange for the Vietnam War. Asthma rates are high, said Joseph Della Fave, the director of the Ironbound Community Corporation. ''In our day care program, upwards of 20 percent of the kids have asthma,'' he said. Luis Ramon, 51, who lives in one of three public housing projects in the Ironbound, says he began to suffer from asthma only after he moved to New Jersey from Puerto Rico. ''If they bring more garbage, it will affect me,'' Mr. Ramon said. ''It will make it worse.'' But American Ref-Fuel's government affairs director, Susan King, said the levels of dioxins, mercury and lead emitted by the incinerator were well within acceptable standards. Even so, no one wants to breathe the air near waste incineration, and if Lower Manhattan sends its waste to New Jersey for burning, some of the stench, and toxins, could waft right back to Manhattan on easterly winds, said Alan Jay Gerson, a New York City Council member who represents Lower Manhattan. Councilman Gerson said New York should be phasing out incineration altogether, in favor of recycling, compacting and landfill. ''Alternatives exist,'' he said."
"THE General Electric Company is trying to package itself as a company that cares about the environment. To those of us who have spent our careers protecting the environment, this would be a bad joke if there were not serious health consequences involved. Last month, General Electric announced its ''ecomagination'' initiative, presenting itself as a provider of environmental and energy technology. In rolling out this strategy, Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric's chief executive, called on the Bush administration to articulate a clear national policy on global warming. While General Electric's increased emphasis on clean technology will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line, Mr. Immelt's credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company's intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy. General Electric's announcement culminates a year of planning and packaging aimed at positioning the company as the dominant player in environmental technology, where it already holds a commanding position. The ecomagination initiative is expected to consume much of the company's $90 million corporate advertising budget, according to AdAge.com, and ramp up General Electric's investment in researching and developing greener technologies to $1.5 billion in 2010, up from $700 million in 2004. The company is making considerable contributions to new products, including wind turbines, energy-efficient engines for commercial jets and fuel cells, which can potentially benefit the environment. But General Electric under Mr. Immelt's leadership hasn't applied its penchant for innovation to the cleanup of the Hudson River, one of the largest federally designated hazardous waste sites. Since the 1940's, and up until 1977, General Electric factories used PCB's, which are persistent organic pollutants, that contaminated the Hudson River. Still today, residual PCB's from their factory sites continue to leak into the river. New York State identified high levels of the contaminants in the upper Hudson River in the early 1970's, and the pollutants have been linked to cancer and other health problems. They wiped out most of the Hudson's commercial fishing industry decades ago. State health officials continue to advise that children and women of child-bearing age not consume fish caught in the Hudson. In February 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency decided that General Electric's PCB's pose a public health and environmental threat and must be dredged up from 40 miles of the Hudson River. Yet three years later, General Electric is dragging its feet on this cleanup. For the past few years, the company has hidden behind a veil of cooperation, doing what regulators have asked while still disputing and trying to negotiate over the agency's decision. The start date for the cleanup has been postponed from 2005 to 2006, and additional delays seem likely. In federal court, General Electric continues to challenge the cleanup law, trying to strip the government of its authority to order companies to deal with hazardous waste. The same week that General Electric rolled out its eco-friendly campaign. Representative Charles Taylor, Republican of North Carolina, using research provided by General Electric, attached language to a House appropriations bill calling for further study of PCB dredging projects. If Congress approves that language, it can be used by General Electric to justify a further delay, if not a derailing, of the cleanup. According to General Electric, the stalling isn't about the cost of the cleanup. The company has consistently assured its stockholders that the cleanup will have no material impact on its financial condition. Indeed, its first-quarter earnings in 2005 exceeded earnings in the same period of 2004 by about $600 million, or $100 million more than the cleanup itself. In rolling out the ecomagination publicity campaign, Mr. Immelt was quoted as saying, ''It's no longer a zero-sum game -- things that are good for the environment are also good for business.'' Only after G.E. uses its ecomagination to rid the nation's waterways of its contamination will these words ring true. Until then, its green campaign is nothing more than an eco smoke screen.

"When Venice Levy had a problem with roaches, she looked for the strongest insecticide she could find. A friend told her about a mystery powder called Tempo. ''When it first came out I bought it. Sure,'' said Ms. Levy, who runs Botanica Oggun in East Harlem and sells herbs and ornaments used in Hispanic spiritual and religious ceremonies. She applied Tempo and the pests disappeared. But then her dog, a Shih Tzu named Chi Chi, sniffed the powder and began to foam at the mouth. Tempo contains cyfluthrin, a potent insecticide that can be lethal to dogs, cats and humans. It is legal for licensed applicators to use but illegal when sold on the streets in part because people use it at 200 to 400 times the recommended quantity, figuring that if using a little works well, using a lot will work better. After a visit to the animal hospital, Chi Chi recovered and went on to live to a ripe old age. Ms. Levy stopped using Tempo. But Tempo can still be found in parts of New York, despite efforts by city officials to go after the peddlers who sell it. And despite numerous health warnings, surveys done by the city show that Hispanics are much more likely than any other group to use it. Getting people in the city's ethnic and immigrant communities to reject harmful products like Tempo is a complex and delicate task, touching on culture, language and sometimes religion. Officials try to balance the benefits of strict enforcement against the danger of offending a large group that is already under economic and social pressures. Sometimes, a ban simply drives hazardous products underground, where they can be even harder to regulate. Part of what makes this such a daunting environmental and health problem is that the people who are most affected are those who are introducing the hazardous materials into their own homes, usually because they believe that using them will take care of a visible and immediate problem. That is why Miguel Gomez's family followed a peculiar ritual before sitting down to supper in their basement apartment in the Bronx. His mother, Myrtha, would crawl under the dinner table and draw a line around its underside with a piece of special white chalk. ''She wanted to make sure that cockroaches didn't crawl up the table while we were eating,'' said Mr. Gomez, now 18. ''It worked.'' It sure did. Although it looked like ordinary blackboard chalk, Mrs. Gomez was actually using a powerful unlicensed insecticide called Chinese Chalk or Miraculous Chalk. Imported in small orange boxes, it sold for about a dollar in Chinatown, East Harlem and the South Bronx. It was toxic to bugs that crossed it, and was widely used in China and Latin America because it was so effective. But it was not approved for use in homes here because it contained deltamethrin, which is highly toxic. Two years ago the New York police arrested a number of people for selling Chinese Chalk and warnings about its dangers went up throughout the city. The efforts appear to have been successful. Mr. Gomez has not seen Chinese Chalk in his neighborhood for a few years, and a recent afternoon spent looking for it in Chinatown proved futile. But many other hazardous products are still out there. Warnings have gone out in recent years about a pesticide from Mexico called Tres Pasitos, which means three little steps in Spanish. It contains aldicard, which is highly toxic to pests and humans. Rats that nibble on it are said to take three steps and die. Nine cases of Tres Pasitos poisoning were reported to the New York City Poison Control Center in the last year. Most of the incidents are believed to involve young children who touched the powder on the floor of their homes and then ingested it. Families living in substandard housing are tempted to use the strongest product they can find. Jessica Leighton, deputy commissioner of New York's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the city often has to enlist a local group that has already established special bonds with a community to help get the word out about risky products. A few years ago, small plastic bags containing a peach-colored powder called litargirio began showing up on city streets. It was made in the Dominican Republic, where it has been used for years as an underarm deodorant and burn remedy. Samples of it contained up to 80 percent lead. It cannot be absorbed through the skin, but any that gets on the hands can be ingested. City officials asked the Alianza Dominicana, a large advocacy and social services group representing Dominicans, to spread the word about the risks of using litargirio. But Moises Perez, executive director of the Alianza, said getting people to stop using it took a lot of effort, even among his own staff. ''They said to me, 'Moises, I grew up with that stuff. My mother used it all the time,' '' Mr. Perez said. The organization's workers had to be convinced that something as familiar to them as litargirio was dangerous before they would tell other people not to use it. No hazard has stirred more sustained controversy than the ritualistic use of mercury in some Afro-Caribbean religions. The practice was first publicized by Arnold P. Wendroff, a former public school teacher, who in 1989 asked his junior high school students in Brooklyn how mercury was used. One student answered that his mother sprinkled mercury on their apartment floor to ward off bad spirits. Mercury vapors can cause developmental problems. ''The government has known about this for a long time,'' said Dr. Wendroff, 64, who has a Ph.D. in the sociology of medicine. ''There needs to be a response plan and there isn't one.'' It is not illegal to sell mercury in New York, but packages have to be properly labeled. In response to Dr. Wendroff's urging, the city has monitored mercury sales in botanicas, conducted air sampling in the shops, and distributed pamphlets about the dangers of mercury, known on the street as azogue (ah-ZOH-gay). No one knows with certainty how great a threat ritual mercury represents. In one of the most comprehensive investigations, Dr. Philip O. Ozuah of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx found that 38 of 41 botanicas he checked in 1995 sold mercury in small vials without warning labels, suggesting that the metal was widely available in the borough. But tests on a large group of children from the Bronx a few years later showed that only 3 percent of them had elevated mercury levels in their urine, where elemental mercury exposure would be detected. Dr. Ozuah, now interim chairman of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore, said he had to conclude at this point that ritual mercury was not a serious problem. He said the most common way it was used -- contained in a good luck amulet -- posed no harm. Mercury can be hard to find now. Ms. Levy, the botanica owner in East Harlem, said she had never sold mercury, but she is certain that those who use it can find other places to buy it, or bring it in from another country. Eric Canales, an ordained Santeria priest, said that even if some sects used mercury in rituals, their numbers were too small to warrant the aggressive crackdown that Dr. Wendroff advocated. ''To blatantly say that because you have a huge Latino population you think there is a huge problem with mercury is prejudiced, inflammatory and ignorant,'' Mr. Canales said. Dr. Wendroff says there is nothing pejorative about making sure that mercury is sold with the proper labeling. Leaders in the Latino community reject his ideas, he says, ''because they are embarrassed about the bad name it gives to the community.''"
"There is so much storm debris in Louisiana that some of it has to be destroyed again. Bulldozers at an immense landfill work atop a mountain of tree limbs and the jagged shards of homes and lives here, pushing piles toward a line of enormous excavators. Each excavator works with balletic grace, grabbing a giant's handful and passing it toward a trailer-size grinder. The manufacturer calls this machine the annihilator. It can chew iron sewer covers as if they were Necco wafers, and it transforms the chaotic mixture to something resembling mulch. It can reduce the volume of debris by two-thirds. It is part of an effort by the Army Corps of Engineers to make the most of landfills that have to accommodate an unprecedented onslaught of debris. The annihilator is just one of the ways that government agencies, contractors and private organizations are trying to shrink the enormous problems caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Here in southern Louisiana, destruction, mitigation and restoration play out against a backdrop of misery and hope. Many of the disaster recovery efforts are financed through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and are managed by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government organizations, and are carried out by contractors. Dump trucks will be feeding the annihilator for some time to come. The pile so far is made up of debris cleared from roads, ditches and levees. Demolition of ruined homes here in Plaquemines Parish will not start until next month. Contractors have disposed of more than six million pounds of waste so far throughout the state, and workers say it is only the beginning. There have been 222,000 refrigerators, washers and dryers gathered, and more than a million containers of hazardous waste have been plucked from land and sea. Sid Falk, the corps manager for debris operations in Louisiana, said that the total volume of debris from the two hurricanes cames to 44 million cubic yards. By comparison, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, previously considered the most destructive United States hurricane of record, left 15 million cubic yards. ''We basically had three Andrews,'' he said. Bill Hurlbut, a scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency who manages a collection site for toxic waste, said that three months after Hurricane Katrina the scene still looked ''like somebody stuck it in a blender and put it on high.'' Mr. Hurlbut is one of two site managers working at the toxic waste site near Buras, squeezed between a bedraggled high school football field and the levee of the Mississippi River. It sits a few miles from Empire on Highway 23, which meanders southeasterly through this peninsula toward the marshy zone where the land morphs into the Gulf of Mexico. Without these efforts to gather hazardous waste, the damage of the hurricanes would go on and on: pollutants would collect in landfills and possibly leach into the soil, or leak into the water. The Coast Guard uses special excavators called marsh buggies that can float and traverse the wetlands without tearing up the fragile landscape. What was once an open field near historic Fort Jackson and across the river from Bayou Mardi Gras now teems with 55-gallon drums and tanks that hold as much as 550 gallons; they have fallen off oil rigs or floated away from industrial sites. ''The ocean burps them up later,'' Mr. Hurlbut said. Big tanks are returned to their owners or cut and recycled as scrap; oil goes to refineries for recycling. Waste has come in from drilling rigs, industrial sites, homes, a hardware store and a hospital. There are fuel and lubricants, pesticides and solvents, medical waste, paint cans and more, and mystery fluids that must be categorized before disposal in a process called ''haz-cat,'' in which workers in white protective suits and respirators draw samples for analysis. But most of the tanks, he said, come in empty. Along with the devastation, there are some signs of renewal: efforts to protect the environment from further damage, and even to improve it. On Wednesday morning, federal and state officials, including the E.P.A. administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, gathered with representatives of private organizations to dedicate 5,000 acres of restored wetlands at Pointe-aux-Chenes, near the southern Louisiana town of Houma. Before the ceremony, Mark Castille, a supervisor with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, steered an airboat through the staggered cuts in even rows of dredged-up hummocks covered with high swamp grass. The muddy rows slowed the water flow, providing a hospitable home for plants and wildlife. In the light of the brilliant morning, birds were everywhere: egrets, killdeer, gadwalls and teals. The project attempts to recreate the conditions that existed when the Mississippi River supplied this part of Louisiana with fresh water. A levee and water gate block most of the saltwater that would wash in from the gulf, and pumping plants bring in fresh water from nearby Bayou Terrebonne; the result should be an environment more hospitable to aquatic plants, beasts and fowl -- and one that buffers the coast from storms. ''When I first came out to work here in '82, all this bayou was solid marsh,'' Mr. Castille said. ''When I came back in 93, it was all open pond.'' The project, more than a decade old, was damaged by the back-to-back hurricanes, and much of the hard-won grass was blown away. ''We were this close to having this project completed,'' said Kenneth M. Babcock, the director of the southern regional office for Ducks Unlimited, the conservation organization that pushed for the project and helped finance it. Finishing the job now is better than starting from scratch, he said. And, while he acknowledged that 5,000 acres might seem piddling in the face of the million acres of wetlands that gave way to open water over the years, Mr. Babcock argued that it was an important start: ''We lost it one acre at a time, and we're going to restore it one acre at a time.'' Other efforts go beyond mud, debris and barrels. On Dec. 12, workers at the toxic waste station near Fort Jackson started gathering money from the 320 workers to buy gifts for local families. ''Guys are giving $100 every day,'' said Jenny Moore, an employee who was collecting from her co-workers. They spoke of a woman with cancer who asked only for presents for her grandchildren, and of a family that escaped Hurricane Katrina with only the truck they were driving. The family settled in Iberia Parish to the west, only to have Hurricane Rita strike southwestern Louisiana and destroy the truck. The workers were sponsoring four families, buying Christmas dinners and gifts like coats, blankets, laptop computers and DVD players for those who had lost so much, Kim Benke, an employee, said. ''It's something to do -- warm their hearts and let them know that somebody cares.'' [When the drive ended over the weekend, $6,500 had been collected, said Dean McInnis, who is one of the workers.] For those trying to bring Louisiana back, mitigating harm is not enough; surrounded by so much heartbreak and loss, they want to mend the human spirit, as well."
"So far this summer, Wing Goodale and his boss, David C. Evers, have used decoys and recorded bird calls to lure about 150 thrushes, warblers and other wild songbirds into nets here and in several others parts of New York City's Catskill Mountain Watershed to determine what is happening to the drinking water. From each tiny bird, no bigger than a cellphone, Mr. Goodale, a research biologist, gently takes blood samples with toothpick-size pipettes. Then Mr. Evers, also a biologist, stretches out a bird's wing and counts down to its 11th flight feather, which he deftly plucks and puts into a plastic storage bag for sampling. Mr. Evers, who is executive director of the BioDiversity Research Institute, a nonprofit research and education group in Gorham, Me., is looking for signs of mercury in the songbirds. He has a pretty good hunch that he will find it, as he has already found mercury in songbirds in the Adirondacks and in New England. If substantial amounts of mercury show up in the blood and feathers he has collected, it could spell trouble for the watershed and, potentially, for the nine million people who rely on the New York drinking water that comes from here because it would mean that the toxin is present in ways that were previously unknown. ''It's far more extensive than was ever put forth to the public,'' Mr. Evers said. Mercury contamination has long been present in lakes, rivers and the city's reservoirs. Mercury, a liquid metal, does not get into water because of broken thermometers, as some believe. Rather, mercury occurs naturally in the earth, including in coal. It is released into the air by coal-burning power plants and other sources. Emissions from power plants in the Midwest drift toward New York. The real problem comes when the airborne mercury comes into contact with water and is transformed into its toxic form, methylmercury. Although the water in New York City's Catskill reservoirs is considered safe to drink, state health officials have posted advisories warning that pregnant women and children ought to limit their consumption of bass, trout and other fish caught in the reservoirs because the fish have absorbed some of the toxic material. Until recently, the mercury problem was thought to be limited to water. The discovery of mercury in songbirds that never go into the water may represent a serious new threat. Mr. Evers was invited to the watershed by the New York chapter of the Nature Conservancy, a national environmental group that has helped protect open spaces throughout the state. In recent years, New York City has spent about $175 million to buy about 60,000 acres of Catskill woodlands to protect the reservoirs. But what good is buying forest land, asked Alan White, director of the conservancy's Catskill Mountain Program, if the health of the forest itself is at risk? It is still early in the investigation, but Mr. Evers, who spent more than a decade studying the impact of mercury on water birds like loons, believes that the harmful form of mercury gets caught in the fallen leaves and other litter on the forest floor, where it is consumed by sow bugs, centipedes and other small insects. As those bugs are eaten by larger bugs, the mercury content is passed on. The buildup of mercury continues as those insects are eaten by songbirds. Mr. Evers and Mr. White say that it makes sense to think of forest songbirds as early warning systems, like the canaries that used to be carried into coal mine shafts. If the canaries died, miners hurried out of the mines because they knew that dangerous methane or carbon monoxide was present. In the same way, unnatural levels of mercury in songbirds could be interpreted as a sign of pending danger in the forests. In loons and other water birds, excessive levels of mercury cause erratic behavior and lower birthrates. The scientists in the Catskills are focusing their attention on the wood thrush, a gutsy little frequent flier with a flutelike voice that can combine two notes at once. The wood thrush can migrate as far south as Panama, more than 2,500 miles from the Catskills. In recent decades, the number of wood thrushes has declined 45 percent, and the reason is unclear. Mr. Evers says biologists initially suspected that destruction of the bird's winter habitat was responsible. But now he thinks elevated levels of mercury could be to blame. The connection between mercury in the birds and the purity of the city's drinking water is indirect, but real. As Mr. White explained, if the songbird population declines, the natural check on insects will be disturbed. Without the birds preying on them, caterpillars and other destructive insects can defoliate forests, killing trees that filter runoff that eventually winds up in the reservoirs. Before dawn, Mr. Evers and Mr. Goodale set up nearly invisible traps, called mist nets, along a trail on the western slope of Hunter Mountain, in between the city's Schoharie and Ashokan Reservoirs. On the forest floor near the nets they placed plastic decoys and CD players that reproduced the thrush's beautiful ee-oh-lay song. By 8 a.m. they had trapped about 10 birds, including several wood thrushes. Because the wood thrush is somewhat larger than other forest songbirds, it is believed that it will show a higher level of mercury when the tests are completed in about six weeks. If these initial studies of songbirds indicate, as expected, that there is a serious problem with mercury, Mr. White said the long-range concern would be that ''these forest systems will start to unravel,'' endangering the water supply. Mr. White said that there was no immediate health danger, and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the city's water system and continuously tests for mercury, has not detected the element in the water. New York is one of only a handful of cities in the country that do not filter their drinking water. What goes into the upstate reservoirs comes out in New York taps 120 miles later unfiltered, although chlorine and fluoride are added. Mr. Evers says it is much too early to determine what the impact of mercury on the songbirds might be, or how long before the reservoirs are affected in any way. But he said that, when it comes to drinking water, it is important to anticipate a potential problem. ''The wood thrush is a good indicator species,'' Mr. Evers said. ''If this small-scale, pilot project shows that there is a danger in these parts, it will be time to go to the policy makers and say this is what we've found, and we should do something about it.''"
"For much of the summer, Dustan Wisner, 15, and his friends have whiled away the days fishing the banks of the Black River. On Friday, he and his friends were beside the river again -- no poles in sight. This time, they were learning that a toxic spill was snaking its way through the slow current and killing vast numbers of fish. ''That stinks,'' Dustan said. And it did. The toxin was liquid cow manure -- three million gallons in all -- creating a murky plume that stretched for miles and giving unfortunate new meaning to the river's name. The manure did not so much spill as gushed from an earthen reservoir at one of the largest dairy farms in the state, Marks Farm, in the nearby town of Lowville. The police were notified on Thursday morning, but the callers did not know when the contamination actually began. ''For some reason, one of the walls of the reservoir gave way and it started flowing into Black River,'' said James M. Martin, the emergency manager for Lewis County, which includes Lowville. Workers tried to shore up the pit, but so much manure escaped that the contamination grew to roughly a fourth the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. ''It started killing all the fish,'' Mr. Martin said. ''Black River is known for its fish.'' Trout, bass, pickerel, pike and walleye, to be exact. As the manure traveled the river's northwest current through several Adirondack communities toward Watertown, a city of 25,000, and on to Lake Ontario, it sapped the water of oxygen and poisoned the fish with ammonia. Hours later, fish began to bloat and float to the surface. ''It's the biggest fish kill I've ever seen,'' said Frank Flack, the regional fisheries manager for the State Department of Environmental Conservation, as he paused while taking oxygen measurements from the river in Carthage, an Adirondack town about 15 miles east of Watertown. ''Before it's all done, it could end up to be millions of fish,'' he said. ''Some of those pike are 20 pounds, so they're 10 to 20 years old. It will be years before the river completely recovers.'' Health inspectors were busy testing E. coli levels in wells. Emergency crews tried to dilute the contamination by increasing the water flow to a Black River tributary. Watertown, which uses the river for some of its public water supply, has cut off intake of the water. A national kayak competition was still scheduled to take place in Watertown next weekend. Residents are praying for rain before then. Canadian officials were keeping track of the plume's path and hoping it would be diluted by the time it reached Kingston and other Lake Ontario communities next week. Investigators said they did not yet know whether Marks Farm was negligent or the victim of some kind of industrial accident. With a milking herd of 3,000 and 55 employees, the sprawling farming complex is one of the larger employers in the region, which depends on agriculture and tourism to survive. Much of the product is used for kosher milk, residents said, and is shipped to outlets in New York City. Mr. Martin said he knew of no previous spills from the farm. The farm's manager, David Peck, declined to comment, saying, ''I'm too busy cleaning up the mess to talk now.'' The farm's Web site says that it is developing a ''manure handling system'' as part of its business plan. Mr. Martin said he had been told by the farm's employees that they were planning to spread some of their manure supply on corn and hay fields. But Steven M. Fuller, whose restaurant, Memories, sits on the banks of the Black River in Lowville, said manure odor from the complex had permeated the air long before the spill. ''Unfortunately, that's a part of living in this area,'' he said. ''Farming is vital to the community, but hopefully this spill will lead to better regulation.'' Since the accident, he and his staff have been clearing the banks of dead fish so customers will not be repulsed. He has had his well water tested, he said, and it is safe. ''Business is starting to pick up again,'' he said, adding: ''Except for the outside decks. That part hasn't been good.''"
"While the human and economic toll of Hurricane Katrina continued to mount, New Orleans was beginning to pump back into Lake Pontchartrain the floodwaters that had inundated the city. But this is not the same water that flooded the city. What started flowing back into the lake on Monday and continued spilling into it Tuesday is laced with raw sewage, bacteria, heavy metals, pesticides and toxic chemicals, Louisiana officials said on Tuesday. Whether or not the accelerating pumping of this brew from city streets into coastal waters poses a threat to the ecosystems and fisheries in the brackish bay remains to be seen, the officials said. They added that they could do little more than keep testing and count on the restorative capacity of nature to break down or bury contaminants. Though the state of the lake was a prime issue, it was just one of a host of problems identified in the storm-ravaged region on Tuesday by Louisiana and federal environmental officials. For example, the officials said that although two large oil spills, from damaged storage tanks, were under control, thousands of other smaller spills continued to coat floodwaters in New Orleans with a rainbow sheen. The first samples of the city's floodwaters were taken on Saturday by the Environmental Protection Agency, and results were expected later in the week, officials said. ''It's simply unfeasible'' to try and hold the pumped water somewhere to filter out pollution, said Michael D. McDaniel, the Louisiana secretary of environmental quality. ''We have to get the water out of the city or the nightmare only gets worse,'' said Dr. McDaniel, who is a biologist. ''We can't even get in to save people's lives. How can you put any filtration in place?'' Some scientists outside government tended to agree that the risk of long-term damage to the coastal waters was not high. One reason is that the lake is fed by several rivers and flushed by tides through its link to the Gulf of Mexico. There will probably be an ''initial toxic slug'' entering the lake but that will be diluted and degraded by bacteria, said Frank T. Manheim, a former geochemist for the United States Geological Survey who teaches at George Mason University and was a co-author of a 2002 report on pollution issues in the lake. ''I think the lake has withstood has some big hits,'' he said, including an oxygen-sapping algae bloom after a 1997 flood. He said that most of the long-lived industrial pollutants that can accumulate in organisms and work their way up the food chain have largely been phased out. Overall, though, it was becoming evident that just the flooding of New Orleans had created environmental problems that could take years to resolve, state officials said. Each of the estimated 140,000 to 160,000 homes that were submerged is a potential source of fuel, cleaners, pesticides and other potentially hazardous materials found in garages or under kitchen sinks, officials said. The E.P.A. on Tuesday estimated that more than 200 sewage treatment plants in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were affected, with almost all of the plants around New Orleans knocked out of action. Hundreds of small manufacturers or other businesses using chemicals or fuels, many with storage tanks held in place by gravity instead of bolts, are probably leaking various chemicals and oils, officials and independent experts said. The E.P.A. and the Department of Health and Human Services issued a joint statement on Tuesday warning people that ''every effort should be made to limit contact with floodwater because of potentially elevated levels of contamination associated with raw sewage and other hazardous substances.'' The statement urged anyone exposed to the water to wash thoroughly with soap and water and alert medical personnel about open cuts. ''Early symptoms from exposure to contaminated flood water may include upset stomach, intestinal problems, headache and other flu-like discomfort,'' the statement said. Officials pointed to a short list of developments they called encouraging: the two largest known oil spills were declared under control, with one slick drifting out into the Gulf of Mexico and away from the state's ravaged coastline, where it will probably degrade over time. As for the lake, ''The wonderful thing about nature is its resilience,'' Dr. McDaniel said. ''The bacterial contaminants will not last a long time in the lake. They actually die off pretty fast. The organic material will degrade with natural processes. Metals will probably fall and be captured in the sediments. Nature does a good job. It just takes awhile.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ENVIRONMENT"
"The global export of electronics waste, including consumer devices, computer monitors and circuit boards, is creating environmental and health problems in the third world, a report to be issued on Monday by five environmental organizations says. The report says that 50 to 80 percent of electronics waste collected for recycling in the United States is placed on container ships and sent to China, India, Pakistan or other developing countries, where it is reused or recycled under largely unregulated conditions, often with toxic results. The groups said there were no precise estimates of the amount of such waste currently created by the disposal of obsolete consumer electronic and computing gear. The Environmental Protection Agency estimated last year, however, that in 1997 as many as 3.2 million tons of ''e-waste'' ended up in United States landfills and that the amount might increase fourfold in several years. The groups also cited National Safety Council estimates that as many as 315 million computers have or will become obsolete from 1997 to 2004, generating a wide range of potentially toxic wastes. For example, each color computer monitor or television display contains an average of four to eight pounds of lead, which can enter the environment when the monitors are illegally disposed of in landfills. ''We've created a problem that has to be dealt with,'' said Ted Smith, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, one of the groups that participated in the report. The others are the Basel Action Network, Toxics Link India, Pakistan's Society for the Conservation and Protection of the Environment and Greenpeace China. An E.P.A. scientist, Robert Tonetti, acknowledged that a significant portion of the nation's obsolete consumer electronics gear was exported. He said, however, that there was no systematic reporting of the shipments, so there was no way to gauge the extent of the problem accurately. ''No one has a good grasp of the numbers,'' said Mr. Tonetti, a senior environmental scientist in the E.P.A.'s office of solid waste. Mr. Tonetti said that figures in a 1999 National Safety Council report showed that about 723,000 computer monitors had been recycled in the United States and 100,000 had been exported. The report noted that more than a million monitors were unaccounted for and that many of them may have gone to parts brokers who subsequently exported the gear. There is an international debate over how to deal with the problem, Mr. Tonetti said, adding that the European Union was moving toward requiring manufacturers to take cradle-to-grave responsibility for their products, particularly when they contain potentially hazardous materials. In contrast, the United States industry has resisted this approach, he said. While there is no consensus on a solution, he said the environmental groups had focused on important issues that should have more attention. Mr. Tonetti added, however, that the cradle-to-grave approach was not endorsed by the United States government. Environmental groups, he said, have overlooked that much electronics manufacturing is now outside of the United States and Europe, complicating the issue of manufacturer responsibility. He also said that a significant factor in the increased export of obsolete electronics from the United States was the closing of smelters here in recent years, frequently because of environmental regulations. The report, ''Exporting Harm: The Techno-Trashing of Asia,'' focuses on electronics recycling around the region of Guiyu in Guangdong province in China. The area, which is northeast of Hong Kong, includes a cluster of small villages that since 1995 have become a booming recycling center for electronic gear arriving from all over the globe through the port of Nanhai. The region has a work force of approximately 100,000 people focused on recycling, the report stated, with the process broken into small, specialized cottage work groups. In one neighborhood, plastics may be salvaged, while in another, circuit boards may be smelted to extract trace amounts of gold and other valuable materials, according to the investigators, who visited the region in December last year. One casualty of the recycling boom in the region has been drinking water, the report says. Since 1995, as a result of groundwater pollution, water has been trucked in from 20 miles away. The investigators said the recycling operations often involved young children, many of whom were unaware of the hazards. The hazardous operations included open burning of plastics and wires, riverbank acid works to extract gold, the melting and burning of soldered circuit boards and the cracking and dumping of cathode ray tubes laden with lead. The report described certain areas of Guiyu that were dedicated to dismantling printers. In those areas, toner cartridges were recycled manually, according to Jim Puckett, an author of the report. ''Workers without any protective respiratory equipment or special clothing of any kind opened cartridges with screwdrivers and then used paint brushes and their hands to wipe the toner into a bucket,'' the report said. It added that the process created constant clouds of toner, which were routinely inhaled. Mr. Puckett, coordinator of the Basel Action Network, said, ''They call this recycling, but it's really dumping by another name.'' The network is an international watchdog group that is trying to enforce the Basel Convention, a 1989 United Nations treaty intended to limit the export of hazardous waste. The United States is the only developed nation that has not signed it. The convention calls on countries to reduce exports of hazardous wastes to a minimum and deal with their waste problems within their own borders where possible. The authors of the report argue that stricter environmental regulations in the developed world have caused a trend toward exporting hazardous materials to the poorest countries, where occupational and environmental protections are inadequate. The environmental groups took water and soil samples along the Lianjiang River and had them tested by a private center in Hong Kong. The results, the groups said, revealed alarming levels of heavy metals that corresponded directly with metals most commonly found in computers. The water sample, taken near a site where circuit boards were processed and burned, showed levels of toxic materials 190 times the levels for drinking water recommended by the World Health Organization. The report also notes evidence of similar unregulated recycling operations in both Pakistan and India. The researchers said that Karachi, Pakistan, was one of the country's principal markets for second-hand and scrap materials. TECHNOLOGY"
"A truck carrying uranium fuel rods crashed on Wednesday night inside an Idaho highway tunnel, and officials said there might be a terrorist connection. Well, no. The crash and resulting alarm occurred only on the NBC drama series ''The West Wing.'' But in New Mexico, where there is a large underground storage complex for radioactive waste near Carlsbad, Gov. Gary E. Johnson guarded against any chance that the people of his state might fear that it really did happen, or could. He instructed his office to reassure them. In a statement issued by that office before the broadcast, the state's Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department explained that for one thing, the transportation of radioactive material is ''well planned between state and federal agencies,'' and officials are ''trained to deal with any possible problems.'' For another, the statement said, Idaho does not have highway tunnels, and in states that do, highways with tunnels are not used for transporting such hazardous material. Anne Clark, a radioactive-waste official who prepared the statement, said that as a result of it she had been receiving inquiries from reporters as distant as Australia, many of them poking fun at the governor for feeling a need to separate fact from fiction. ''Clearly, we all know TV drama is fiction,'' she said. ''But usually things that are portrayed could happen. So where's the line? We thought it was a good idea to let people know what could happen and what couldn't happen.''"
"A judge declared a mistrial today in a groundbreaking suit in which Rhode Island tried to hold paint manufacturers responsible for the health hazards of lead-based paint. The suit, seeking to take a page from the suits against tobacco companies, was the first time that a state had filed such a claim against paint manufacturers. It was closely watched by jurisdictions that have filed similar lawsuits, including Chicago, Milwaukee, New York City, St. Louis, San Francisco, a score of cities and counties in New Jersey and several school districts and housing authorities. The mistrial was declared by Justice Michael A. Silverstein of Superior Court in Providence after a six-member jury that had deliberated for four days told him that they were deadlocked. The judge has to decide whether there will be a new trial. The jury was charged with determining whether lead-based paint, which the federal government banned in 1978, was a public nuisance, posing an immediate or potential public hazard."
"A husband and wife were found dead in their home in Queens yesterday, apparently from carbon monoxide poisoning, the police said. The authorities said that the couple's car had been left on in a garage underneath their house on 20th Road in Whitestone, and that fumes might have seeped into the home. ''It doesn't look like foul play,'' a police official said. ''It looks like a tragic accident.'' The couple, Greta and Everett Gibson, both 72, lived in a single-family home. Mrs. Gibson was found in the laundry room downstairs, and Mr. Gibson was found in a recliner in the living room. The couple's son could not reach his parents by phone yesterday, so he called his sister, who lives next door to them, said Laura and Arthur Blasi, who live across the street from the Gibsons. The daughter found Mr. Gibson just after 3:30 p.m., the police said, then called the authorities. The deaths came one day after four members of a New Jersey family died from a similar cause. On Monday, two parents and their two adults sons were found in their home in Woodbridge, N.J., in what the police called an accidental case of carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly from a malfunctioning heating system."
"The New York City school system announced yesterday that it had shut off drinking fountains and posted warning signs on sinks at about one in five of its public elementary schools, after finding that the level of lead in the water slightly exceeded federal standards during tests completed last month. The lead was found in water at 222 of the city's 990 elementary schools during tests that started in August. The levels were not high enough to pose a significant health risk, said David Chai, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein. The exact levels of lead in the water were not released yesterday, nor were the names of the affected schools. But officials began notifying parents, principals and unions at the schools by letter. Notices will also be posted in the schools. All told, 298 sinks, used mainly for washing hands, and 254 drinking fountains were found to have water that exceeded the federal government's recommended safe level for drinking water, 20 parts per billion, Mr. Chai said. There is no apparent pattern among the affected schools, he said, but the source of the lead appeared to be old pipes. The city began daily flushing of the water systems of all schools in August to minimize the possibility of lead in the water until each school had its water tested, officials said. Water at the city's middle and high schools is now being tested. The tests, part of the city's first comprehensive school-water-testing program, are believed to be the most comprehensive tests in the nation, officials said. The only previous tests were in 1996, when water in some city schools was randomly sampled and tested for contamination, Mr. Chai said. The results of those tests were not available. Ernest Clayton, the president of the United Parents Association of New York City, said, ''I've got to give them credit for having it done, but for this to have gone unattended for so long is really a shame.'' Many of the school buildings are a century old, he said, and the water in their pipes may have contained lead for decades. Mr. Clayton said the association would advise parents to take their children from the affected schools to the doctor for blood tests. Dick Riley, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers, said he had not yet seen the test results, but added that he hoped the city would fix the affected sinks and fountains as soon as possible. Plumbing systems and fixtures once routinely used lead, but that is now prohibited, according to the Web site of the New York City Health Department. In buildings with old pipes, joints or fixtures, it can be released when the water is heated or sits in the pipes. Lead can disrupt the growth and development of a child's brain and nervous system, and is most dangerous to children younger than 6. At high levels, it can damage the kidneys, blood and brain."
"ENVIRONMENTAL threats often have an overwhelming sweep that can paralyze people eager to help. When considering toxic waste in Asia, fouled water in Africa, radioactive landscapes in Russia, where do you start? In the face of such vast issues, Richard Fuller, a successful recycling and energy-use consultant to American companies, decided a few years ago to start small, very small. He sought grants and diverted some assets of his business, Great Forest, into creating the Blacksmith Institute, a vest-pocket nonprofit that scours the world's toxic spots for clearly defined and fixable pollution problems. Mr. Fuller says he is unapologetic about looking for the simpler kinds of challenges, mainly because there are so many, and because many hide in plain sight with no one doing anything to clean them up. There is the slaughterhouse in downtown Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which is the source of 80 percent of the waste rendering the Msimbazi River nearby toxic and infectious. There are the sprawling dumps in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where infectious hospital waste mingles with trash that is scavenged by flocks of poor children. Then there is Kabwe, a city of 250,000 that grew up around a century-old lead smelter and is so contaminated that many neighborhoods would qualify many times over as Superfund sites, if they were located in Illinois instead of Zambia. Although the smelter closed in 1994, residents still excavate the dusty earth by hand to get at residual seams of the neurotoxic metal. Some schoolyards contain mineable concentrations. Thousands of people have blood-lead levels many times higher than the American limit. IT was pressure from Blacksmith that prompted the Zambian government to agree to include Kabwe in a list of mining sites it plans to clean up under a pending $40- to $50-million loan from the World Bank, officials of the bank said. Initially, the cleanup was focused on the opposite side of the country, in a copper-mining region. Kabwe's problems had been identified, but government officials had tried to play down the dangers for years, reports by the Blacksmith Institute said. The institute's involvement as an independent force brought the issue of including Kabwe on the list to a close, said Yves Andre Prévost, senior environment specialist in the bank's Africa region environment group. ''The bank is not in a position to take an issue and bring it to public attention,'' he said. ''The fact that Blacksmith identified the issue and started doing things about it comforted us, and allowed us to tell the government you can't run away from this one.'' Mr. Prévost said that Blacksmith had shown a knack for identifying local partners who can pinpoint pollution problems and devise possible solutions. Blacksmith can also raise money and channel it where it can do the most good, he said. Mr. Fuller appears to be determined not to waste money, Mr. Prévost said. ''In Kabwe, there was some consultant offering his services for something like $300 a day,'' he said, and Mr. Fuller said, ''get lost.'' The annual budget for Blacksmith's projects has grown to about $400,000, an amount that pales beside the budgets of groups like the Nature Conservancy or the National Wildlife Federation. Mr. Fuller, a youthful 42-year-old Australian, operates Great Forest and Blacksmith out of a 29th-floor office on Park Avenue in New York (www.blacksmithinstitute.org). The other full-time employee is Sara Kate Gillingham, who until recently was writing grants for urban agriculture projects in places like Yonkers, and now spends her time inspecting toxic dumps in Maputo, Mozambique. The group's small size has led to remarkable agility, as are Mr. Fuller's entrepreneurial instincts, said Frances Beinecke, who advised Mr. Fuller when he was establishing his group and is the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the influential American environmental organization. ''We'd have to have a multiyear plan and figure out how to have a long-term impact,'' Ms. Beinecke said. ''He finds a sewage problem or a lead problem somewhere and cobbles together resources from here and there, and in developing countries it makes a big difference.'' Ms. Beinecke also noted that Mr. Fuller's focus was on toxic pollution even though most American conservation groups, when working overseas, stress saving species or ecosystems. Usually, Blacksmith finds ways to support a particular official in a local government agency that is responsible for cleanups but lacks the ability to get the job done. SOMETIMES, the support is as basic as a retainer of $200 a month for local contacts who act as coordinators for pollution surveys or other projects. In many countries, this can easily be enough to double someone's income, Mr. Fuller said. In places like Cambodia, where the government has not yet mandated environmental laws, Mr. Fuller and his staff -- one full-time development expert, several part-timers and volunteers -- draft legislation. Last year, the group conducted the first thorough survey of Phnom Penh hospitals and clinics to determine what they do with their hazardous waste. Blacksmith is now working with government officials to outline legislation to control the flow. In places where there is little hope of working effectively with a government, Blacksmith finds a local nonprofit group or helps to establish one, often a person with a telephone and a computer. In Dar es Salaam, the contact is a collection of environmental engineering school graduates who found the unfiltered streams of blood and offal flowing from the slaughterhouse into the Msimbazi River. These are not green activists waving placards, Mr. Fuller said. They have a specific design, right down to the size of the necessary pipes, he added. Plans are under way for a $70,000 loan to build a treatment plant for the slaughterhouse, Mr. Fuller said. As more of Blacksmith's projects move from planning to concrete cleanups, Mr. Prévost said, it is becoming evident that the group's technique could be applied widely. What is also clear, Mr. Fuller said, is that many hot spots remain. His next destination is Siberia, where towns near former factories that generated plutonium during the cold war were contaminated with traces of radioactive materials. He will be heading there next month to assess the situation. So far, Mr. Fuller said, he has always solved these seemingly intractable problems. ''You get a punch list of things that need to happen some place until we can tick it off and say its pollution problems are solved,'' he said, adding that the goal is to ''be reasonably sure kids can be born without the risk of getting really sick or dying young.'' THE ENVIRONMENT"
"An oil truck spilled its slippery cargo onto a North Jersey highway yesterday, shutting it down for several hours. But this was not your typical spill: the lubricant was used cooking oil. A truck loaded with about 2,500 pounds of the oil overturned on Interstate 78 near Newark Liberty International Airport just after noon, shutting all five eastbound lanes of the highway for nearly five hours and creating miles of traffic jams on the highway and nearby roads, officials said. The entire cargo spilled across the eastbound lanes, and at least two vehicles slid out of control on the slick and crashed, the state police said. No drivers were seriously hurt, but the ensuing traffic snarl delayed thousands of vehicles on Interstate 78, nearby stretches of the Garden State Parkway, and several local roads that feed into both highways. By 6 p.m., state trucks had hauled in about four tons of sand to absorb some of the spilled oil, and the operation to coat the entire slick was expected to continue until at least 9 p.m., said Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Transportation."
"Car exhaust fumes that killed a doctor in a possible suicide here today drifted up from a garage into a four-story apartment building, leaving five people with carbon monoxide poisoning and prompting the evacuation of about 20 others, the police said. Residents of the building, the Avalon Crest Apartments, described a frightening, chaotic scene shortly after 8 a.m. Firefighters, responding to a 911 call about carbon monoxide detectors being set off, went door to door, some with axes, and ordered occupants to leave at once. ''They were running around the building, banging on doors and telling everyone to get out,'' said one resident, Gail Fabrikant. ''Nobody was even allowed to change. They were very thorough.'' After she was roused, Ms. Fabrikant said, she hurried into a hallway reeking of eggs, apparently the residue of exhaust fumes from the car, and then went outside. Clusters of firefighters were waiting with oxygen tanks to help those with breathing difficulties, she said. Other firemen were tending to several adults and small children who were vomiting in a parking lot at the rear of the complex, said another woman, who would not give her name. She said she had been awakened by the ringing of the carbon monoxide detector in her living room. All the apartments are equipped with carbon monoxide detectors. Joseph Licata, Fort Lee's emergency management coordinator, said firemen searched all 47 apartments in the building and ordered the evacuation of at least 25 residents. The five residents who were overcome by fumes were taken to area hospitals for observation and treatment, Mr. Licata said. He said they did not seem seriously ill. Firefighters found the body of the doctor, Robert Stenson Jr., 42, in his locked car, which was parked in one of the building's one-car garages at ground level, said Capt. Steven J. Hervey, a spokesman for the Fort Lee police. The garage itself was also locked, he said. ''The overall circumstances seem to point to suicide,'' Captain Hervey said, though he cautioned that the police had not ruled out the possibility that the death was an accident. There was no evidence of foul play, he said. Captain Hervey said no suicide notes had been found. He said detectives planned to question Dr. Stenson's family, friends and colleagues in an effort to determine if he had become despondent recently over any problems. Dr. Stenson's wife last saw him alive when he left their apartment at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, the police said. ''He said he was going to the hospital to see his patients,'' Captain Hervey said. ''We don't know if he ever left the garage.'' A 1985 graduate of Tufts University School of Medicine, Dr. Stenson specialized in the treatment of ovarian and uterine cancer. He maintained a practice in Tenafly, and had served on the staff of Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck since 1998. From 1993 to 1997, he was on the staff of Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. Kevin McCarthy, a vice president for public affairs at Holy Name Hospital, called Dr. Stenson's death a tragedy. ''He was a highly skilled surgeon and well respected,'' Mr. McCarthy said."
"Even as the Bush administration is trying to increase the aerial spraying of drug crops in Colombia with herbicides, an American law enacted in January threatens to disrupt the strategy and possibly even halt it. A little-noticed provision in the $15.4 billion spending measure for government operations abroad requires that the American-backed program to eradicate coca crops in Colombia must meet the same health and safety standards that would apply if the herbicides were being sprayed in the United States. ''Colombia is far away, but we are making decisions that can directly affect the health of thousands of people there,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat, who sponsored the new law. ''The American public and our own health agencies would not allow use of a toxic chemical like this on this kind of scale.'' The provision requires that before the program in Colombia can proceed, the Environmental Protection Agency must certify that the spraying of a herbicide mixture containing glyphosate from low-flying planes does ''not pose unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the environment.'' The glyphosate mixture is a variety of the weed killer known by the trade name Roundup. Although most types of Roundup used in the United States have been found to be only mildly toxic when used according to instructions, the compound used in Colombia has more restrictive handling instructions, indicating a higher toxicity, and has not been widely used in this country. It was approved for use here only in November. An unfavorable finding by the Environmental Protection Agency could jeopardize one of the main United States efforts to reduce the production of cocaine, for which the coca plant is the raw material, at its source. Experts say that assessing the impact of the spraying will be complicated without an epidemiological study, which would be costly and difficult given the remote and sparsely populated areas where coca is grown. Advocates for Colombians exposed to the fumigant have charged that it caused a variety of ill effects. They assert, moreover, that an additive intended for use in Colombia, to make it stick to the coca plants, makes it even more dangerous. Congressional supporters of the spraying program said they had been compelled to support Senator Leahy's provision or face losing the overall spending measure, which also finances programs like aid to Israel and Egypt, security for international embassies and AIDS prevention around the world. Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican, denounced the Leahy provision as ''one more roadblock that the bleeding hearts tried to throw in front of our program.'' The herbicides used in Colombia are no more toxic ''than what most people use in their backyards,'' said Mr. Mica, who is co-chairman of the House task force on counternarcotics. But critics of the spraying say that is not true. The mixture used in Colombia carries handling instructions that correspond to the highest Environmental Protection Agency toxicity rating, Class 1, while most Roundup products used in the United States fall into the more benign Class 3 or Class 2. Even if the product were safe, the critics say, there is no way to ensure that it is applied according to E.P.A. standards. ''It's not the same as what you're finding on the shelf at the Home Depot,'' said Anna Cederstav, a staff scientist at Earthjustice, an environmental law firm. When the Environmental Protection Agency reapproved the glyphosate for use in this country in 1993, the agency said it had ''relatively low'' acute toxicity when sprayed on the skin or ingested. But, noting that it caused high numbers of injuries to agricultural workers in California, it required a standard precaution that workers generally not be allowed to enter areas that have been sprayed for 12 hours. A restriction like that would be impossible to enforce in the areas that would be sprayed in Colombia. Environmental Protection Agency officials, who have been studying the matter since last spring, missed a deadline last week to present their conclusions to the State Department, which is preparing a report on the program's safety for Congress. The review will not be complete for ''a handful of weeks,'' said David Deegan, an E.P.A. spokesman, adding, ''It's pretty difficult for us to evaluate a program in Colombia.'' Lino Gutierrez, an assistant secretary of state, said the goal this year was to fumigate 370,000 acres of coca, compared with 207,000 acres last year. The program involves about 14 crop-dusters operated by American and Colombian pilots or foreign contractors. Colombia's incoming president, _lvaro Uribe, has embraced the spraying. But so far it has had mixed results. Despite widespread spraying last year, the amount of coca under cultivation rose by nearly 25 percent, the State Department has reported. State Department officials say the herbicide being used is not toxic, even when people are directly sprayed. One official who defended the program said he had been inadvertently sprayed with the herbicide in Colombia on 15 occasions and had suffered no adverse effects. Still, in a statement to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, advocates for Colombians who were exposed to the fumigants said the spraying caused ''gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., severe bleeding, nausea and vomiting), testicular inflammation, high fevers, dizziness, respiratory ailments, skin rashes and severe eye irritation.'' Last year, four Colombian governors from zones with heavy coca cultivation traveled to the United States to ask for a halt in spraying. The fumigation program ''doesn't really take into account the human being,'' said Ivan Gerardo Guerrero, their spokesman. ''All it cares about are satellite pictures.'' The administration has also fueled suspicion about the herbicide mixture used in Colombia by refusing to disclose its precise ingredients or discuss how the final product is prepared. Officials say they do not want to divulge corporate trade secrets. But spraying opponents accuse the administration of trying to conceal other components, known as surfactants, added for use in Colombia to help the glyphosate to stick to the coca leaves. ''We don't know what those surfactants are,'' said Dr. Cederstav of Earthjustice."
"Five years ago, Flutorime Jani and her extended family settled on the grounds of an abandoned chemical plant. Fleeing from the barren, lawless mountains, they found a spot a few miles from this city, Albania's main port. At first they thought they were lucky. ''The land was free,'' Mrs. Jani said. Bricks and tiles were also free. The men stripped them from the old factory buildings and created shacks. The word spread, and today the plant is a shantytown with more than 3,000 inhabitants. Today, it is also a place where experts say people are being collectively poisoned. Until 1990, this state factory made a range of hazardous chemicals, including chromium 6, used in leather tanning, and lindane, a pesticide so dangerous that many nations ban it. Mrs. Jani is among those who complain of nausea and stomachaches. ''The pains come often, like the clouds,'' she said, raising a hand helplessly to the heavens. Last year, the United Nations Environment Program, in its first assessment of Albania's environment, designated this site of the former Porto Romano chemical plant ''an environmental disaster area'' that posed ''grave risks to human health, groundwater and the marine habitat.'' The report called for closing the area, removing the settlers and monitoring the health of 10,000 people living on the fringes of the plant. The government's only action was to build a wall blocking the access road. Angry residents tore it down, and new settlers keep coming. ''We have no money to fence it off,'' said Miri Hoti, the mayor of Durres, shrugging. He implied that the foreign experts were overreacting. ''These people come here voluntarily, though it's banned. There is no other housing.'' About 400 tons of chemicals are still stored on the 750-acre site, leaking from corroded steel barrels and spilling from torn bags. The acrid sting of lindane fills the air. Some residents keep vegetable patches. Cows and goats rummage among the rusting metal vats. Mrs. Jani's grandchildren, like the other children, play on the contaminated grounds and roll in the noxious dust. New homes are going up along the plant's open dumpsite, which holds 20,000 tons of hazardous waste. The unfolding crisis here is a result of the anarchy that began a decade ago with the end of the harsh Communist regime. It was compounded when vast pyramid investment schemes collapsed in 1997, ruining countless Albanians. The Janis, from the mountains near Macedonia, were among the losers. Mrs. Jani, looking worn at 53, said the vegetables she grows here and the milk from her cow taste different. On hot days, she has to leave her home because of the overwhelming vapors coming off the walls, once part of the lindane warehouse. She made a gesture of nausea. ''Where do we go?'' she said. ''The authorities are doing nothing for us.'' Lushi Bajrami, 33, a supermarket worker, said he had developed kidney and lung problems. ''The doctors don't know what's really wrong with me,'' he said. The first time he heard the site was dangerous, he said, was when the United Nations investigators arrived. Samples taken by the experts help explain why things here taste different. Milk from Mrs. Jani's cow had lindane concentrations 100 times higher than the European safety limit, the report said. On family vegetable plots, lindane concentrations were more than 600 times what the Dutch would consider hazardous waste. Lindane accumulates in the food chain and long-term exposure can lead to lung, liver and kidney damage, the report said. Water samples from a well had more than 4,000 times the level of chlorobenzene acceptable in drinking water in Europe. Intense exposure to this solvent can affect the nervous system, bone marrow, blood and fertility, the report said. Besnik Baraj, a chemistry professor at the University of Tirana, offered a guided chemical tour. ''This is chromium 6,'' he said, walking past green-yellow piles. ''Our university can transform this into less harmful chromium 3, but we would need some $50,000 to do an assessment, study samples and get started, which is money we don't have.'' The dust now, he said, is very dangerous. He compared the toxic residues to a huge and lethal inkblot spreading into groundwater, people's bodies and the plants and animals they eat. From the plant dumpsite, the residues seep into the bay, he said. Children swim there. Fishermen haul up fish and crabs that are eaten in Durres and Tirana. Trucks cart away soil to build roads and houses. So the inkblot, he said, will grow ''until all the materials are contained by a kind of permanent box above and below ground with impermeable layers of concrete and clay.'' President Rexhep Meidani said his country, the poorest in Europe, had many other problems. He told a conference on religion and the environment organized by the Eastern Orthodox Church that he hoped foreigners would pay for the cleanup. Tatjana Hema, an official of the embryonic environment ministry, said that by some estimates it would take $10 million to secure the area and provide permanent storage for waste from this plant and from an abandoned soda factory near Vlore, where mercury is spreading.. ''We know it's a public health hazard, but settlers here and in Vlore don't believe our warnings,'' Ms. Hema said. ''They think it's just a ploy to get them off the land.'' Durres Journal"
"Q. What is the significance of the design for the biohazard symbol, something like a Ninja death star, commonly seen in hospitals? A. The symbol, chosen in 1966 with the help of the Dow Chemical Company marketing department for containment systems made for the National Cancer Institute, was picked precisely because it had no known meaning but was easy to remember. A fairly scientific process was used to make sure. First, survey groups were shown 24 recognizable symbols, like the Red Cross and swastika, mixed with half a dozen labels for Dow products. Those surveyed were asked to guess what each symbol meant, and the proposed biohazard symbol drew the fewest guesses. A week later, the same people were tested with the original symbols, plus 36 more common ones, and asked which one they remembered best. The biohazard symbol won. The color chosen was blaze orange, for high visibility. The design is three-sided, so it is recognizable on a box in any position. It is also easy to stencil. The design was presented in a paper by John Cook in the journal Science. Then authorization was sought from bodies that would be using it, like the Centers for Disease Control, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institutes of Health. With minor variations, the design is still in use. C. CLAIBORNE RAY Q & A Correction: July 31, 2002, Wednesday The Q&A column in Science Times on June 25, about the development of the biohazard symbol, misstated the authorship of a 1967 article about the symbol in the journal Science. It was by Charles L. Baldwin and Robert S. Runkle, not John Cook. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse."
"It took six hospitalizations and a number of misdiagnoses before Lynn Milam learned what was causing the vomiting and diarrhea that almost killed her in 1999. The arsenic levels in her body, her doctor said, were about 100 times what they should have been. Ms. Milam was relieved to have a diagnosis, however terrifying. That relief vanished when the police arrived. ''They said someone was trying to kill me, and they were almost 100 percent sure it was Tom,'' her husband, Ms. Milam said. But she refused to believe it. ''I know the man,'' she said. ''If he were going to kill me, he'd just shoot me.'' Ms. Milam's instincts were borne out when laboratory tests conducted by the F.B.I. showed that her husband had even more arsenic in his system than she had in hers. The results helped take the wind out of the criminal investigation, but the case has not gone away. It has since evolved into a consumer lawsuit focused on the last remaining suspect in the poisoning of the Milams: the A-frame cabin they had been building in this small town some 20 miles south of Memphis. Vicki S. Wood, one of the Milams' lawyers, said the couple were victims of chromated copper arsenate, or C.C.A., the predominant wood preservative in the United States and the subject of an emerging body of product liability lawsuits around the country. Some of the lumber for the Milams' two-story cabin frame had been treated with C.C.A., which prevents decay and repels termites. It also contains arsenic. Arsenic, a chemical that occurs naturally in the environment in small amounts, is a fatal poison at high doses and a known carcinogen at lower ones. C.C.A.-treated wood, a $4 billion industry, is a popular choice for decks, picnic tables and playground sets that must stand up to warm, wet weather. The wood has a distinctive pale green color and is sold in home improvement stores nationwide. There is substantial evidence that C.C.A.-treated lumber leaches arsenic over time. Whether that is cause for concern is in dispute, as is the safety of playgrounds built with C.C.A.-treated wood. ''C.C.A.-treated wood is practically everywhere,'' said Hugh McNeely, a Louisiana lawyer who represents plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against sellers and manufacturers of the wood. ''The potential for widespread personal injury or potential latent manifestation of arsenic- and chromium-related health problems is profound.'' The industry disputes that. A report commissioned by two manufacturers and prepared by Barbara Beck, a toxicologist with the Gradient Corporation, environmental consultants, concluded that ''use of C.C.A.-treated wood in both a residential and a playground setting does not pose a significant health risk to children or adults.'' In an interview, Dr. Beck said the risks associated with incidental exposure to C.C.A.-treated wood and the soil beneath it were lower than those associated with arsenic in food or allowed under the new federal limits for arsenic in drinking water. Philip J. Landrigan, a professor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, said the dangers from incidental exposure were a matter of perspective. ''All cancer risks are dose-related,'' he said, ''but since this is not an essential product for life in the modern world, we should find a way to live without it.'' While there is debate about incidental exposure, there is agreement that working with the wood can be dangerous. The Environmental Protection Agency and manufacturers of treated wood advise consumers not to use wood with surface residue; to wear gloves, a dust mask and goggles while sawing; to saw outdoors; and never to burn the wood. The Milams did everything wrong. ''I was holding each log while Tom cut the end of it,'' Ms. Milam said. ''I was wearing shorts and no gloves.'' They worked indoors, and they burned some of the wood. Jeffery Artis, a spokesman for the F.B.I., comes close to asserting cause and effect. ''We have not made a determination that the arsenic in their bodies came from the treated wood,'' Mr. Artis said, ''but we know that at the time the arsenic levels were very high, they were working with the sawdust.'' The Milams have sued several manufacturers and retailers, all of which deny responsibility for the poisoning, and the American Wood Preservers Institute, a trade group. Its president, Parker Brugge, declined to comment on the lawsuit. As a general matter, he said, ''the wood is safe when it's used according to the consumer safety sheet'' put together by the industry. The Milams say they never received such information. Experts say this is common. ''You see people go into a lumberyard and ask for wood to build a deck,'' Professor Landrigan said, ''and there is no sign or other warning about these dangers.'' Mel Pine, a spokesman for the trade association, said that the industry had fulfilled its obligation to inform the public about the dangers of treated wood but that until recently, ''at the retail stores the compliance was less than perfect.'' That is improving, he said. An audit of 250 major retailers in March, he said, showed that about 80 percent tagged the wood with a condensed version of the safety sheet. The industry and the Environmental Protection Agency have announced that sales of C.C.A.-treated wood for residential uses will be phased out by the end of next year. Mr. Brugge said the decision was based on ''changes in perception, changes in the marketplace'' and a new generation of preservatives without arsenic. Mr. McNeely, the lawyer in one class action, sees it differently. ''It's a rear-guard action,'' he said. ''They're trying to defend themselves as they're retreating.'' In announcing the phaseout, the E.P.A. said that it ''does not believe there is any reason to remove or replace C.C.A.-treated structures, including decks or playground equipment.'' At the same time, the statement continued, ''any reduction in the levels of potential exposure to arsenic is desirable.'' In addition to the case being pursued by Mr. McNeely in Louisiana, another class-action suit has been filed in Florida. Both suits, which are in their early stages, are aimed primarily at the property and environmental damage, as opposed to any personal injury, that is attributed to the treated wood. Litigation experts say the success of those suits and the potential for liability will turn on scientific evidence that neither side yet has. ''Before a toxin becomes a litigation concern, there has to be some science, and in this case this issue is so immature that we really don't know if the plaintiffs are going to overcome that,'' said Bill G. Lowe, who edits Emerging Toxic Torts, a newsletter. In addition to the class actions, about 30 individual lawsuits have been filed nationwide involving claims of acute poisoning from sawdust, splinters and inhalation, said David S. McCrea, an Indiana lawyer who has handled some of the suits. He said that a handful of such cases had been tried before juries and that the plaintiffs had prevailed in all of them. Other suits have been settled, and some have been dismissed before trial on statute-of-limitations grounds or because the plaintiffs could not make even a preliminary case that their injuries were caused by the defendants' products. Mr. McCrea said that only a small percentage of treated-wood injuries resulted in lawsuits, mostly because arsenic poisoning is so difficult to identify or, where it is identified, because its cause is rarely determined. He said the Milams' experience illustrated both difficulties. The police here worked the case hard. They questioned the Milams repeatedly and always separately. They advised Ms. Milam, a 50-year-old computer programmer, to leave her husband, 46, or at least prepare her own food. They sought help from the F.B.I., and the district attorney went to a grand jury to have it consider a charge of attempted murder. ''I felt like the Hernando Police Department came into it predetermined like it was attempted murder, and they had a pretty good little case,'' Ms. Milam said. ''It was really big for them.'' Mr. Artis, the F.B.I. spokesman, said the case was dubious from the start, because it lacked a motive. ''She was the breadwinner,'' he said. ''There's no big insurance policy. There's no girlfriend.'' District Attorney John W. Champion sounded defensive about having presented an attempted-murder charge to the grand jury even after the F.B.I. tests cleared Mr. Milam. He recalled being convinced by an F.B.I. analysis implicating the treated wood. On the other hand, a member of his staff had consulted the industry. ''One of my investigators kept telling me that lumber companies had told him that this couldn't be,'' he said, meaning that the F.B.I. was wrong. Mr. Champion said he had presented both theories to the grand jurors. ''I point-blank told them I believed the F.B.I.,'' he said. The grand jury declined to indict Mr. Milam."
"With a vote nearing on the future of the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch Development in Ventura County, opponents led by the former head of the E.P.A., Carol M. Browner, asked officials today to delay a decision until more is known about contamination from toxic perchlorate found near the site. ''The questions that are being raised here are very serious questions,'' said Ms. Browner, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency for eight years, ending in 2000. ''Perchlorate is very serious stuff, particularly to our children.'' Exposure to perchlorate, a substance in rocket fuel, has been found to delay development in infants and children and lead to thyroid disease and cancer in adults, experts have testified. The levels found in the samples were 28 times higher than those considered acceptable under E.P.A. standards. Ms. Browner noted that just six soil samples had been examined at the 2,800-acre site and that commonly used guidelines would recommend 600 to 700 tests on a site that size. ''You simply don't have enough information at this point in time to make this decision,'' she told the hearing conducted by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. Officials with Washington Mutual, the developer of the project, said it had taken steps to relieve the pollution, which was found in a well outside the site. The well was to have been used for irrigation. ''No one disputes that perchlorate is a toxin, and the health of the families who will live on the Ahmanson Ranch and the families in neighboring communities is important to us,'' said Tim McGarry, a vice president with Washington Mutual in Seattle. ''But today's testimony from Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch was largely beside the point, because it failed to deal with a number of key factors.'' Among the factors he outlined was an accord to treat the well water and remove the chemical along with an agreement to cap the well if it remains a problem. Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loan association in the nation, has been aided in its case by former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Although it has not been established where the chemical originated, the Santa Susana field laboratory of Rocketdyne, a rocket testing and nuclear research complex, is near the proposed development and is widely considered a possible source. Rocketdyne is a unit of Boeing. Daniel Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, which assists communities near nuclear complexes, said that several reactors operated at Santa Susana and thatit had been the site of at least one partial meltdown. The Ahmanson Ranch, which would be a minicity that would have 8,000 residents and a town center with 400,000 square feet of office and retail space, as well as a golf course and hotel, was approved 10 years ago. A series of suits challenging environmental reviews have delayed it for more than five years. In 1999, the endangered California red-legged frog was found at the site along with the San Fernando Valley springflower, which was thought to have been extinct for 30 years. Further environmental studies were conducted. The hearing today was scheduled to discuss the environmental impact report, which, if approved, would clear the way for building to begin. A vote could be taken as early as Wednesday, with the developer pressing the board to act before its year-end recess on Dec. 20. The board will change members early next year with a supervisor who favors building being replaced by a new supervisor who has opposed it. Even if the ranch is approved, Los Angeles and other municipalities have made it clear that they intend to continue fighting it for several reasons, including the adverse effects it would have on traffic."
"Despite the risk of serious accidents, tons of obsolete chemical weapons stored at sites across the country can be safely disposed of by incineration, a division of the National Academy of Sciences concluded in a report released today. The report from the National Research Council said destroying aging stores of chemical weapons in high-temperature furnaces is not without risks. But delays in getting rid of the leaky stockpiles could be even more dangerous to the public, it contended. ''Safe chemical weapons disposal operations are feasible at the new facilities scheduled to begin operating at Anniston, Ala.; Umatilla, Ore.; and Pine Bluff, Ark.,'' according to the report, which called for rigorous operational procedures and enforcement of strong safety measures. A 13-member committee of experts examined operations at two older incinerators and identified 40 ''serious'' incidents involving unexpected releases of chemical agents. But the panel concluded that such incidents could be avoided or reduced with more diligence, better training and placing a greater emphasis on safety than on meeting disposal schedules. The panel said the new plants, which each cost the Army almost $1 billion to build, should be put into operation as soon as possible because of the deteriorating condition of chemical stockpiles, including nerve agents and toxins, such as mustard gas. ''The risk to the public and to the environment of continued storage overwhelms the potential risk of processing and destruction of stockpiled chemical agent,'' the report found. ''The destruction of aging chemical munitions should proceed as quickly as possible.'' The committee examined 12 years of operations at the first two incinerators that were commissioned to destroy 31,000 tons of nerve and toxic blister agents deployed in millions of individual artillery shells, rockets and other containers. About one-quarter of the stores already have been destroyed by burning them at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, primarily in furnaces at Johnston Atoll in the Pacific and at the Deseret Chemical Depot in Tooele County, Utah. Most of the 40 chemical releases the panel studied in detail occurred within the disposal plants, but three reached outside the buildings. In those three incidents, data showed that no more than the equivalent of a few drops was released into the environment and little or none spread beyond base fences, the report said. In contrast, it said, several hundred leaks occurred at two storage sites housing deteriorating weapons and containers, most more than 40 years old. In the most serious of these incidents, 78 gallons of mustard agent escaped into the environment, the report said. Dr. Charles E. Kolb, the president of Aerodyne Research, an environmental research company in Billerica, Mass., who served as the committee's chairman, said that no leak at the incinerators threatened residents beyond the perimeters of the plants, but that safety concerns needed to be addressed seriously. ''There will be future chemical events,'' he said in an interview. ''But we are saying it's still possible to do this safely if we strictly observe procedures at the plants and make safety the highest priority.'' The committee recommended that the Army: establish criteria to uniformly classify chemical events at all disposal plants; research improved emission sensors that issue fewer false alarms; institute review boards that include a citizen representative at each site to investigate release incidents; and provide more comprehensive training for plant personnel. Craig Williams, director of the Chemical Weapons Working Group, a Kentucky-based coalition of local groups opposing the incinerators, called the report a ''whitewash'' that understated the risks of burning chemical weapons. ''This report is anything but objective and balanced,'' Mr. Williams said. ''The committee only examined selected incidents of leaks and other problems and ignored other significant incidents.'' Instead of incineration, Mr. Williams called for wider use of a chemical neutralizing process to destroy the weapons agents that will be employed at bases in Newport, Ind.; Aberdeen, Md.; Pueblo, Colo.; and Blue Grass, Ky."
"Spared from worry about whether they will have enough to eat today or a roof over their heads tomorrow, most Americans have the luxury of worrying about the hazards that may be lurking in their air, water and food as a result of all this progress and affluence. We are healthier, live longer, have more sources of pleasure and convenience and more regulations of industrial and agricultural production than ever, but we are also more worried about the costs to our health of environmental contaminants. This is not to say there is nothing to worry about. In an ideal world, progress would result only in benefits, no risks. In an ideal world, we would be able to produce, organically and inexpensively, all the food we need and the food our importers rely on. In an ideal world, manufacturing would leave no residues in air, water or soil, and people would be smart and disciplined enough to resist exposure to health-robbing substances like tobacco and consistent about using protective devices like seat belts, helmets and condoms. But this is not and never will be an ideal world, so bad things will occasionally happen. Regulations cannot control every risk. Besides, every regulation has a price. The millions or billions spent in compliance and enforcement might be better used in ways that would save many more lives, and sometimes the cost is not worth the potential benefit. I say ''potential'' because in many cases, the risks involved are only hypothetical, extrapolations from studies in laboratory animals that may have little or no bearing on people. For example, despite widespread belief and laboratory studies in rats that link pollution to breast cancer on Long Island, this month an $8 million federal study found no evidence that environmental contamination from pesticides and industrial chemicals was responsible. Why People Worry ''People are scared about environmental dangers,'' noted Dr. Glenn Swogger Jr., a psychiatrist in Topeka, Kan. ''Being scared affects their ability to think realistically and use good judgment.'' Underlying these fears, he believes, are uncertainty about the effects of exposures to certain substances, a tendency to overreact and seek scapegoats in stressful situations, guilt about our affluence and an unspoken wish to return to a simpler and purer world. Experts in risk perception say people who become agitated about real or potential risks are influenced by a number of ''outrage'' factors. Prominent among them is control. Is the risk voluntarily assumed or imposed by others? A woman I know who eats only organically grown food enjoys rock climbing, skiing and whitewater rafting, sports far riskier than all the chemical fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotics combined. Likewise, does it make sense for smokers to worry about pollution from a nearby factory? In short, too often, the risks people worry most about are out of proportion to the actual dangers involved. Next is the fairness factor. Is there a benefit to the consumer, or are consumers assuming risks resulting from benefits gained only by the manufacturer? A classic example is toxic waste dumped on a community. Or, if there are some consumer benefits, are they out of proportion to the risks? One example is the use of antibiotics in animal production, a process that has led to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Is the hazard natural or caused by people? Although there was a brief flurry of concern about radon, which emanates naturally from soil and rock, perpetual and far more intense concern arises over radioactivity from mine tailings and nuclear power plants. Yet the known cost to lives from other energy sources, including solar power, gas and oil, still far exceeds that associated with nuclear power. How new or familiar is the risk? People worry much more about possible accidents caused by new technologies than about ones they have known about all their lives. Traditional plant-breeding techniques have resulted in no protests. But the introduction of genetically modified foods has prompted some people to pay premium prices for foods said to be free of any genetic manipulation, even if it results in more wholesome products. Is there potential for a catastrophe? Consumers have repeatedly ranked nuclear power as the No. 1 hazard among more than two dozen activities and technologies, including smoking and handguns. Many people are far more frightened of air travel, especially after a plane crash, than they are of driving, which, mile for mile, presents a far greater risk. Facts to Consider It is not possible to anticipate, regulate and control every risk. Priorities must be assigned for risk management, with time and money devoted to those hazards best established and most likely to cause the most harm. Not every regulation is a good investment. For example, for each premature death averted, the regulation that lists petroleum refining sludge as a hazardous waste costs $27.6 million while the rule that does the same for wood preserving chemicals costs $5.7 trillion per death avoided, according to estimates from the Office of Management and Budget. The asbestos ban, at $110.7 million per life saved, was a bargain compared with the exposure limits placed on formaldehyde, which cost an estimated $86.2 billion per death averted. Animal tests that result in cancer caused by a suspect substance do not necessarily apply to people. Half of all chemicals that have been tested have caused cancer in one or another experimental animal, but not always in all species or strains tested or even in both sexes. Often animal strains genetically susceptible to certain cancers are chosen for these tests. When very large doses are used in animal tests, the result is often toxicity and inflammation, which itself can cause cancer even if the substance is not carcinogenic. A cardinal rule in toxicology is ''the dose makes the poison.'' You can eat a dozen carrots at once with no ill effect, but 400 carrots could kill you. Animal studies rarely reveal the possible effects, or safety, of long-term exposure to the kinds of low doses people may experience. Keep in mind that we all have livers, which accrue and detoxify small amounts of hazardous substances. Another limitation of animal tests is their usual failure to detect risks that may result from interactions between two or more otherwise innocuous substances. Remember, too, that ''natural'' is not necessarily safer, and just because something is manufactured does not make it a potential hazard. Nature is hardly benign. Arsenic, hemlock and, despite its current medical applications, botulism toxin are wholly natural but also deadly. For helpful, detailed discussions of how best to consider environmental threats, consult the new book ''How Much Risk?

"A trial under way in Rhode Island, the first state to file such a suit against paint manufacturers and one in which nearly 80 percent of the housing is believed to contain lead paint, is being closely watched by cities and states around the country. Several jurisdictions, including New York City, Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee, San Francisco, have filed similar lawsuits, contending that the companies are responsible for the learning and behavioral problems often suffered by lead-poisoned children. ''Lead paint litigation has the potential to become the next major corporate plague, analogous to asbestos litigation in corporate America,'' said Tim Gerdeman, an industry analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''It could become a major, major financial drain for my companies. A few years ago people seemed to discount asbestos and tobacco litigation, and shame on those people who did, because look what happened.'' The potential costs are significant. The Rhode Island lawsuit is asking paint companies to pay for the cost of removing lead paint from the 331,000 dwelling units the state says contain it. The suit does not name a figure, but Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse said it cost $2,000 to $10,000 to remove lead from each house, putting the total cost at roughly $600 million to $3 billion. The lawsuit also seeks money for the treatment of lead-poisoned children. In Rhode Island, more than 35,000 children under 6 have been found to have elevated lead levels since 1993, said Dr. Patricia A. Nolan, director of the state's health department, who said authorities were continuing to see new cases at an average rate of seven a day. Rhode Island, which has a large number of older homes, has a higher incidence of lead poisoning than many states. But national studies in the 1990's found that two-thirds of the nation's housing still contained lead paint and that 890,000 children ages 1 to 5 had elevated lead levels in their blood. The lead paint lawsuits are clearly lifting some pages from the tobacco suits, particularly in the role that governments are playing as plaintiffs, combining the resources of state and city legal arms with the expertise and staff of private law firms. One of the law firms involved in the Rhode Island case is Ness, Motley, Loadholt Richardson & Poole, a Charleston, S.C., firm that represented 28 states in the tobacco litigation. Legal experts and industry analysts are curious to see whether the Rhode Island case has found a way around some of the legal minefields that have caused other lawsuits against the paint industry, many of them filed by individuals, to founder or have some or all of their claims dismissed. ''This Rhode Island case is not only the highest profile case,'' Mr. Gerdeman said, ''but based on the first few weeks of testimony, the plaintiffs seem to have a pretty solid approach.'' Lead paint cases face some legal hurdles the tobacco cases did not. Lead paint, unlike cigarettes, is no longer manufactured, having been banned by the federal government in 1978. While the Rhode Island lawsuit accuses the industry of promoting the use of lead paint while covering up its danger to children, much like allegations against the tobacco companies, the paint industry says it acted to curtail its use after it learned of the risks, beginning in the 1950's. While cigarettes, when used as directed, are known to cause cancer, paint manufacturers have long contended that lead paint itself is not hazardous, but causes poisoning only when allowed to deteriorate to the point at which paint flakes or dust can be ingested or inhaled. ''The companies have argued that it's only a danger if it is peeled off and eaten,'' said Paul Martinek, editor of Lawyers Weekly USA, who has followed the lead paint cases. ''They can say, 'We didn't manufacture this product to be peeled off and eaten.' And the landlords, the building owners could remove this material if they wanted to.'' That is exactly the case that the paint companies are making in the Rhode Island case. ''Lead paint is a good product,'' said Bonnie Campbell, a former attorney general for Iowa who now advises some of the paint companies being sued. ''It isn't the presence of lead paint which causes the problem. Properly maintained, leaded paint generally poses no hazard or risk. There is a culprit here, and that is the landlord.'' Tim Hardy, a lawyer for one of the companies, N.L. Industries, said studies suggested that a small percentage of the homes with lead paint were unsafe, ''primarily rental properties which are in very poor condition because there's been no basic maintenance for years.'' The success of such arguments in the past, experts say, makes it striking that the Rhode Island case has gotten this far. The case was filed in 1999 against a lead industry trade group and eight paint makers, including E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and the Sherwin-Williams Company. In the courtroom this month, in the first of four phases of the trial, pediatric and environmental health experts have testified that lead paint is always a potential problem and that even in homes where the lead level is low enough to meet Environmental Protection Agency standards, there is no proof the paint will not cause problems. Leonard Decof, a lawyer for the state, said in opening arguments that lead paint chips and dust could be released into the air by hanging a picture or opening a window. He said that paint also deteriorated naturally, no matter how well-kept a property was. ''What more can we say than this: Lead paint, even when it's painted over, is harmful,'' Mr. Decof said. In an interview this week, Mr. Whitehouse, the Rhode Island attorney general, offered his own home as an example of Mr. Decof's point. He said his two children, now 9 and 13, had elevated levels of lead as toddlers. He said he did not know if his children had been adversely affected. ''Lead interferes with brain development,'' Mr. Whitehouse said. ''You have to know what they otherwise would have been.'' But there are many obvious cases of lead poisoning in Rhode Island. Kizzy Cole said two of her three children were hospitalized because of high lead levels when she lived in a rundown apartment with peeling paint in Providence, and her daughter, now 10, was now ''kind of slow as far as learning goes.'' Kristen and Jack Field, a middle-class couple who moved into an old colonial home in Cranston and began to fix it up several years ago, said their two daughters had lead problems because the home had lead paint inside and outside. ''We're a married, white, educated, middle-class family,'' Ms. Field, a nurse, said. ''They focus on the landlords, the slumlords, and it's not true.'' The Rhode Island case is the first to come to trial accusing the paint companies of causing a public nuisance, a relatively untraditional legal strategy that is being used increasingly in other lawsuits, including some of those filed by cities against gun manufacturers. In the first phase of the trial, the state is simply trying to prove that lead paint is a public nuisance, something posing an immediate or potential public hazard. If the state wins the first phase, it will try to show that the paint companies are responsible for helping to correct the problem. Among other things, the state will introduce documents it says show the industry knew about the hazards before it took action and described the problem as relegated to ''slum children.'' ''They were fighting a losing battle and tried to keep their product on the shelves for as long as they could and they did so at a time when they knew that the product was dangerous, in particular for children,'' Mr. Whitehouse said. Industry representatives said such documents were dismissed in a previous lawsuit. ''The reality is that these companies really acted very appropriately dealing with this issue right from the time in the late 40's that they discovered or suspected that it appeared that poorly maintained lead paint was harming children,'' Ms. Campbell said. She said the state would be better off cracking down on landlords, a view Mr. Whitehouse said was ''a little bit like with the arsonist saying that the fire department should be working harder.'' Mr. Whitehouse said that causing a public nuisance did not require fault or intent; someone can be held responsible even if they acted ''innocently and lawfully.''"
"A couple who ran an asbestos removal business in Westchester County have been charged with operating illegally for years, using forged documents to renew a state license and issuing false air-sample analyses to hundreds of homeowners, the Westchester County district attorney said today. From 1999 to 2002, Richard and Eleanor Rinaldi removed asbestos from about 500 homes in the county, according to the district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro. The jobs ranged in price from several hundred dollars to several thousand. Investigators have not determined whether the removal work itself was done improperly. But they charge that Mr. Rinaldi, 57, and Mrs. Rinaldi, 65, who at one time had operated with a valid certification, forged insurance certificates to renew their license from the State Department of Labor. In addition, the couple, whose companies operated under the names Certified Asbestos Abatement and Economy Asbestos Abatement, provided homeowners with fictitious reports that said air samples taken from their homes were free of asbestos, law enforcement officials said. Investigators said they were unable to locate or find any record of the laboratory listed on the reports. All such laboratories must be certified by the state. The Rinaldis, who until recently lived at 13 Old Aspetong Road in Bedford, N.Y., were also charged with illegally storing asbestos at that address from late 1999 until the middle of 2001, officials said. The couple stored the asbestos, a hazardous material formerly used in insulation, in black plastic bags on the front lawn of the Bedford home, the authorities said. The State Department of Environmental Conservation assisted in the investigation. Officials say the couple recently sold the house for $1.19 million, and the authorities have seized some of the proceeds to provide compensation to homeowners whose properties might require additional asbestos testing. ''Obviously, if we get a conviction, we will try to get restitution,'' Ms. Pirro said. ''It's about making the victims whole again.'' The couple were arraigned on Tuesday in Bedford Town Court. They were charged with multiple counts of endangering the public health, safety or environment in the third degree; scheme to defraud in the first degree, and criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree, all felonies. The district attorney's office sent a letter to the affected homeowners this week. The letter suggests they contact the county's health department with concerns about any remaining asbestos in their houses."
"Seeking to counter assertions that the nation's nuclear plants are vulnerable to attacks like the one on the World Trade Center, 19 prominent nuclear experts have concluded that a reactor containment building could easily withstand the force of a jetliner crash. But the federal laboratory that conducted a major test cited by the experts says its experiment was not meant to demonstrate anything about reactors' structural soundness. The 19 experts, many of them retired, work or worked at universities or companies that build or operate reactors. In an article on Friday in the journal Science, they dismiss fears voiced by opponents of nuclear power that the nation's reactors are vulnerable to a terrorist attack. ''We read that airplanes can fly through the reinforced, steel-lined 1.5-meter-thick concrete walls surrounding a nuclear reactor,'' the article says, ''and inevitably cause a meltdown resulting in 'tens of thousands of deaths' and 'make a huge area uninhabitable for centuries,' to quote some recent stories.'' But, they add, ''no airplane regardless of size, can fly through such a wall.'' The article says the scenario ''was actually tested in 1988 by mounting an unmanned plane on rails and 'flying' it at 215 meters per second (about 480 m.p.h.) into a test wall.'' The engines penetrated only about two inches and the fuselage even less, according to the article. But the relevance of the test, conducted at Sandia National Laboratories, has long been in dispute. People who opposed nuclear power before Sept. 11 pointed out that the test wall moved several feet; the movement reduced the damage by absorbing some of the force of impact. At Sandia, a spokesman, John German, said the point of the test was to move the wall, as a way to measure the impact forces. The test was sponsored by the Muto Institute of Structural Mechanics Inc., of Tokyo, as a preliminary step in building a computer model of such impacts, but the Japanese decided not to sponsor the next step, Mr. German said. Asked if it showed that a plane could not penetrate a dome, he said, ''We've been trying like heck to shoot down this rumor.'' Mr. German said: ''That test was designed to measure the impact force of a fighter jet. But the wall was not being tested. No structure was being tested.'' The nuclear experts contend that the test makes their point nevertheless. The opponents of nuclear power have argued that the plane in the Sandia test, an F-4 Phantom, weighs far less than a jumbo jet. But James Muckerheide, a nuclear engineer who is the co-director of the Center for Nuclear Technology and Society at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, on whose work the authors relied, said in an e-mail response to a reporter's question that penetrating a reactor containment building would take far more than an airliner. Compared with the F-4, Mr. Muckerheide said, ''a large passenger aircraft is a slow, empty, tin can.'' ''The mass of the aircraft can put a heavy compression load on the containment structure,'' he said, ''but it has negligible penetrating ability.'' The containment building can withstand huge compression loads, he argued. The fact that the block in the Sandia test moved had a trivial effect, Mr. Muckerheide said. Whether a containment building is the soft spot of a nuclear plant is also not clear. Most of the radioactivity in a power plant is in the spent fuel pool, which, critics note, is usually in a building that is far less sturdy. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is conducting an engineering analysis of the vulnerability of power plants to aircraft attack, Sue Gagner, an agency spokeswoman, said. ''If warranted by the ongoing detailed analysis, we will consider changes,'' Ms. Gagner said. Articles in Science, like those in many scientific journals, are reviewed before publication by experts not connected with the authors. But the magazine's editor in chief, Donald Kennedy, said that if there was a difference between the authors and the group that performed the experiment, ''they're going to thrash it out in our letters column, and we'll let them do it.'' The magazine is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. THREATS AND RESPONSES: REACTOR VULNERABILITY"
"New York City and federal health officials are working out the final details of what they say would be the largest study of its kind ever undertaken -- a far-reaching health registry to follow as many as 200,000 people exposed to ash and dust from the destruction of the World Trade Center. The $20 million registry, paid for by federal disaster relief money, is intended for residents and employees in Lower Manhattan, rescue and recovery workers, people who were evacuated from their homes after the disaster or anyone else who simply happened to be in Lower Manhattan on the morning of Sept. 11. The primary goal is not so much to obtain treatment for people who might still be sick more than a year after the attack, health officials say, but rather to interview people to get a broader picture of who was affected and to look for patterns in illness and recovery that individual physicians and clinics might have missed. The power, registry planners say, will be in the numbers. ''We will have enough people enrolled to evaluate whether there are long-term pulmonary effects associated with exposure,'' said Dr. Polly Thomas, the assistant commissioner at the bureau of surveillance at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. ''If there is an associated increase in asthma, heart attacks or post-traumatic stress, you need large numbers of people in different categories to see it.'' But even some of the project's supporters, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has pushed for long-term health monitoring, say that the extensive delays in beginning the registry, which was first discussed last summer and which may still not be up and running until the spring, have sharply escalated the project's difficulty. ''People move away,'' Senator Clinton said. ''How are we going to track down these people after so much time?'' Other health experts say that tricks of memory itself could also come into play -- especially with a traumatic event like the trade center attack, which for tens of thousands of people produced effects from sore throats and coughs to sleepless nights. Registry officials concede that time has taken a toll. ''The longer we wait, the longer it takes and the harder it gets,'' said Sharon Campolucci, the deputy director at the division of health studies at the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is designing the study with the city. Ms. Campolucci said the design of the registry has been complicated by thorny issues of statistics and public health analysis, and by its size. Because the registry will be divided into groups of people who had sharply different levels of exposure, from downtown shoppers who breathed in the ash for a day to volunteers who labored at ground zero for weeks, designers must assemble lists of who might be included in each group, how many people might be needed to draw valid scientific conclusions, and the different questions that the people in each group will be asked. The biggest federal registry previously designed by her agency, Ms. Campolucci said, had 12,000 people. The Mount Sinai School of Medicine is leading one of the largest medical investigations of the disaster, with up to 9,000 people being examined by doctors. Dr. Thomas said another complication in putting together the registry was deciding who would be eligible to participate. Millions of people were exposed to the dust and ash to one degree or another, she said, but the goal was to reduce the list to about 500,000 people. Of that number, the planners hope to enroll 200,000 in the study. The study's organizers are obtaining lists of people who lived, worked or went to school in the area. People who wish to participate but who are not sure if they are identified on any list will be able to volunteer if they qualify. And while some of the parameters are still being considered, Dr. Thomas said, for now the registry is restricted to people who were living or working in Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, or who worked or volunteered at ground zero, or at the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, where much of the debris and remains were examined. The interviews, most of which will be done by telephone, are expected to begin in late spring. Another major issue still to be resolved is all about money. The $20 million committed to the registry will pay only for its initial creation and the first round of interviews. Checking in with respondents on a regular basis in years to come -- a major goal of the designers, who hope to keep the project going to 2021 -- would require a lot more money. ''It will not be cheap,'' Dr. Thomas said. She said the amount needed in future years would depend on the frequency of follow-up interviews, among other factors. Health experts also stress that the World Trade Center registry does not include any medical diagnosis or clinical examination. People who say in the interviews that they are still physically sick will be provided with referrals for medical care. People who say they are still experiencing emotional or mental problems will be connected to mental health experts at Project Liberty, a crisis counseling service created by state and federal authorities after the disaster."
"In 1984, 40 tons of lethal gas leaked from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India. Thousands of people were killed. The Bhopal disaster led Congress to pass a law requiring companies to disclose chemical emissions. But even though Bhopal was an overseas disaster, the law it inspired applies only in the United States. Dangerous pollutants are just one aspect of corporate behavior that can be hidden abroad. Companies should have to make public information about overseas activities that would be prohibited or subject to disclosure laws at home. A new report by a coalition of environmental, labor and human rights groups, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Sierra Club, Oxfam and Amnesty International, argues for an international right to know. The groups are not seeking new prohibitions on company behavior. Instead they would require large companies that are traded on United States stock exchanges and have significant international operations to disclose information that could affect the communities in which they operate. The group's model is the registry created by the post-Bhopal law, the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory. The database has given communities a tool to measure and fight toxic emissions. There has been a 50 percent drop in releases in the first decade of the inventory, according to data from the E.P.A. The organizations also cite the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as an example of a successful tool to improve American business practices overseas. Globalization has brought new scrutiny to the practices of multinational corporations. Environmental, labor and human rights groups are using lawsuits, good-conduct labels, public protests and other methods to force or shame companies into better behavior. The idea of an international right to know is a creative and, for the companies, a not particularly burdensome new approach. American companies could still behave badly if they chose to do so. The law does not prevent irresponsible mining companies in Peru from spilling mercury on local roads, or toy makers in China from employing children. But they would have to tell the public about these practices, and let the market, and public opinion, go to work. Companies and trade groups argue that such burdens would be onerous. In fact, the requirements would apply only to very large companies, and many of these would experience little difficulty. No American company that offends American values should be allowed to do so in secret."
"In a study that will help assess the health of Vietnam veterans, researchers at Columbia University have doubled the accepted estimate of the chemical dioxin contained in defoliants sprayed during the war. The study, to be published Thursday in the journal Nature, re-examined military documents and concluded that an additional 1.8 million gallons of herbicides -- most commonly Agent Orange -- were sprayed by United States forces. The author of the report, Jeanne Mager Stellman of the Mailman School of Public Health, said it would be the basis for the first comprehensive study of the effects of chemical herbicides on American soldiers. ''The Vietnam War ended in 1975, yet no large-scale epidemiological study of herbicides and the health of either the Vietnamese population or war veterans has been carried out,'' the report said. From 1961 to 1971, the United States sprayed defoliants over more than 10 percent of what was then South Vietnam, in an effort to deprive its enemy of forest cover and food crops. Some 14 percent of the area's forests were destroyed, according to government figures. The various herbicides were identified by the colored stripes on their containers -- purple, white, pink, blue, green. The best known, and most common, was Agent Orange. American officials and many independent researchers caution that there is no certainty that these herbicides are responsible for the illnesses and birth defects reported among both American veterans and Vietnamese citizens and their children. The Veterans Association in Washington now offers compensation for 10 diseases as well as for the birth defect spina bifida that have been determined to be linked, or possibly linked, to the spraying in Vietnam. But the United States has declined to offer compensation to the Vietnamese until further scientific assessments are made. The higher numbers included in the new study come from the inclusion of previously omitted spraying and from a determination that some of the herbicides contained higher concentrations of dioxin than had been known. Dr. Stellman emphasized that the discrepancies were not the result of any cover-up but the result of the discovery of a trove of military reports as well as from her inclusion of missions flown between 1961 and 1965. Her study of the original military reports allowed her to view the thousands of missions in a more coordinated way. ''The major point is there is a new inventory and we have an experimental methodology, and it's time to go ahead and do some studies before we are all dead,'' she said. Dr. Stellman said her report also suggested that a significantly higher number of Vietnamese civilians had been directly exposed to the spraying than had earlier been realized. Examining hamlet census data collected during the war and putting them side by side with her study's more accurate tracking of the spraying, she found that millions of people had lived in targeted areas. ''I was actually pretty much surprised about this myself, and I recalculated many, many times,'' she said. ''The number of people in hamlets that flights were directly over, it numbers in the millions. I was quite astounded by this.'' A large number of American forces had also been directly exposed to the spraying or had served in recently sprayed areas, she said. Her report will make it possible to study more accurately the health effects this may have had."
"This rough-hewn city along the Hudson just north of Albany claims to be where the Industrial Revolution began in America, and it even salvaged the remains of an old ironworks foundry by turning it into a museum. But its industrial heritage also left a different legacy: polluted land along the waterfront. These abandoned industrial sites, known as brownfields, have long been contaminated with chemicals, fuel and other pollutants that seeped deep into the ground. Until the brownfields are cleaned up, they cannot be used for other purposes, frustrating the city's plans for a $100 million effort to redevelop the waterfront. ''This city was one of the economic engines for the Empire State,'' said Mayor Mark Pattison of Troy. ''And we are suffering from that now.'' Many cities and towns say that brownfields have become their biggest environmental problem, and by some counts there are more than 10,000 of them scattered across the state, including thousands in New York City alone. Most have remained untouched for decades, scarring inner cities and older suburbs, and in some instances contributing to sprawl by causing developers to turn to greener fields like farmland. While Gov. George E. Pataki and state leaders say that something must be done to reclaim these blighted urban areas, they have remained deadlocked for nearly four years over how to clean up brownfields. Environmental groups and lobbyists routinely point to the issue as one of the most blatant examples of dysfunction in the Capitol, where impasses often paralyze legislation for years. At the heart of the legislative standoff is a disagreement over how clean is clean. Democratic Assembly leaders have pushed for rigorous and costly cleanups of all brownfields. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, and the Republican-controlled Senate, so as not to scare off developers, have advocated less stringent cleanups of sites that are to be used for commercial and industrial projects. This year, however, Senate and Assembly leaders have indicated that brownfields are a priority and have made overtures toward an agreement. Last month, the Senate diverged from the governor's longstanding brownfields proposal and passed its own, calling for tougher cleanup standards and financial incentives for property owners. ''It was time to get it done, it was time to create some action,'' said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, whose district includes Troy. On Wednesday, he surveyed a crumbling red-brick factory along the Troy waterfront that he said illustrated the problems. On Monday, the Assembly also plans to introduce a bill that includes several significant concessions, including less stringent cleanups of sites that are not going to be used for residential purposes. ''I don't think we compromised on standards,'' Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, the bill's sponsor, said. ''You can fight to the death for a standard, but if the result is you don't have a program, what's the environmental benefit of legislative gridlock?'' But members of both chambers have questioned whether Governor Pataki will be willing to compromise on the issue, or whether they will reach an agreement only to face a veto from the governor. Mr. Pataki included brownfields legislation in his executive budget in January, and state officials have continued to lobby for it. A spokeswoman for the governor, Suzanne Morris, said that while his aides have not yet seen the Assembly bill, they have already started working with Senate leaders. ''We look forward to beginning a three-way discussion on this important issue once the Assembly finalizes its position,'' she said. New York is one of the few states without a law to regulate the cleanup of privately owned brownfields. While a 1996 state law set aside $200 million to help restore brownfields owned by local governments, municipalities have applied for money for only 153 sites. About $170 million remains unused, largely because, local officials say, it is burdensome to comply with the law's requirements. Another reason is that many brownfield sites are privately owned. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation is also monitoring the reclamation of 568 privately owned brownfields through a voluntary program established in 1994. Under that program, property owners agree to pay for the costs in return for certain assurances that they will not be sued by the department for future cleanups. The environmental conservation commissioner, Erin M. Crotty, said the governor's bill would strengthen and expand existing cleanup standards that have already proven effective in New York and other states. She added that a new law would offer ''certainty and predictability'' to property owners and encourage them to take on more cleanups. Some Assembly members and environmentalists have criticized the department for approving less rigorous cleanups of brownfields that are to be used for commercial and industrial buildings. They say allowing even a small amount of pollution to remain in the ground limits the future use of that site and may contaminate neighboring properties In addition, some environmentalists say that the state has not done enough to promote cleanups in less desirable locations, including many low-income neighborhoods. ''Developers are going for the least contaminated sites in the best locations,'' said Val Washington, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York. ''So the question becomes, how do you give them incentives for other cleanups?'' The obvious answer is money. The Senate and Assembly are proposing to give millions of dollars in tax breaks to people who clean up brownfields. They have also included new provisions to safeguard against brownfield contaminants spreading through groundwater or other means. The two chambers remain divided over cleanup standards, but that gap seems to be closing. The Senate bill calls for the level of cleanup to be determined by what contaminants are at a particular site. The Assembly bill would set a higher cleanup standard but make exceptions for sites that cannot be used for residential purposes. Senator Carl L. Marcellino, chairman of the environmental committee, said that negotiations have picked up in the past year after a leadership change in which Mr. DiNapoli was installed as the chairman of the Assembly environmental committee. The two men, who are longtime friends from Long Island, have said they are willing to compromise to reach an agreement. ''There are some people who would rather have this issue out there than to have an actual cleanup,'' Senator Marcellino said. ''But if we can get this done, this will be the biggest environmental cleanup -- and the biggest economic development boom -- in the state's history.'' Despite the effort to work out differences, the passage of a new brownfields law remains far from certain. The competing bills have already splintered environmentalists, who are vigorously lobbying both chambers. For instance, Environmental Advocates and others say the Senate bill would create ''the best brownfields program in the nation,'' while the Sierra Club and the New York Public Interest Research Group maintain that it does not go far enough. ''The Senate bill is a step in the right direction, but there are too many flaws for it to be palatable,'' said Laura Haight, senior environmental associate of the group, which favors the Assembly version. Meanwhile, the Business Council of New York State and other groups oppose both bills, saying that they are still too restrictive and would hamper development. ''Not only are you dissuading projects, you're also ensuring that no one comes forward to clean up these sites at all,'' said Ken Pokalsky, the council's director of environmental programs. In Troy and elsewhere, city officials are closely watching the state's efforts to legislate brownfield cleanups. While brownfields make up only 15 percent of the land in this city of 50,000, nearly all of it lies along the waterfront, which is the largest remaining tract of open space that can be developed. Mayor Pattison said Troy's growth has stagnated because of the Legislature's inaction. Just last year, he said, a national bakery company backed away from building on a site after it learned about the pollution. And high-tech industries do not even bother to come knocking, he said. ''We're not going to be a greenfield,'' he said. ''But for cities like us to survive, we need economic development, and we won't get that if we're left with just the brownfields.''"
"ON a chilly afternoon in March, a burly man climbed onto a narrow concrete slab at the Peekskill Sewage Treatment Plant and balanced himself precariously above a rivulet of brown sludge. ''I ask you,'' he said, looking down at a stream of gurgling brown sewage, thick with bits of rag, refuse and toilet paper. ''Who else would do this but the Warrior?'' The warrior in this case is Ronald Gatto, 45, the county's new environmental watchdog-in-chief, and as usual, he was singing his own praises. One of his many nicknames -- one of the printable ones, he jokes -- is the Watershed Warrior, which he earned during his 20 years as a police captain with New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. He had a decorated but tumultuous tenure there, protecting the city's watershed, mostly in Westchester County, with an extensive record of aggressively pursuing polluters of local streams and reservoirs. But he also alienated himself from his own agency by contending, in testimony and in a whistleblower lawsuit in 1999, that his superiors consistently blocked him from arresting illegal dumpers and endangered the watershed by playing politics and going easy on certain major polluters. In turn, some agency officials criticized him as a loose cannon and a publicity-hungry maverick with no patience for teamwork. Last November, Mr. Gatto finally left the city job and was named director of the county's newly formed Department of Environmental Security. He also happens to be the entire staff of this one-man department, an arm of the county's Department of Public Safety that reports to its commissioner. But Mr. Gatto has a stable of county police officers and detectives he can call upon for criminal investigations relating to the environment, as well as other county officials. County Executive Andrew J. Spano, who created the position and hired Mr. Gatto personally, said that he hoped to coordinate environmental safety countywide for properties in need of increased security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. These include office buildings, parkland and the county airport, as well as its sewer system, treatment plants and transfer stations. In hiring Mr. Gatto, Mr. Spano said he hoped to begin consolidating security for areas long under the jurisdiction of many different departments. ''I wanted someone who would keep a single focus on environmental issues from a law perspective and also protect the watershed from terrorism after 9/11,'' he said. ''Ron knows the watershed inside and out, coming from the D.E.P., so it was an easy choice.'' Mr. Gatto reiterates what many environmentalists have claimed for years: that environmental enforcement in Westchester suffered because of piecemeal jurisdictions and agency overlap. ''These things were never really looked at from a unified standpoint,'' Mr. Gatto said. He is spending more time watching for the pollution and poisoning of county property away from the reservoirs. He is still involved with the watershed, but his role there is more about securing it from possible terrorism than chasing polluters. On Nov. 26, he was sworn in as a county police officer. Armed with a gun, badge and 20 years of experience chasing down polluters, Mr. Gatto is the county's only environmental inspector with the power to arrest violators himself. He is officially a member of the Westchester County Department of Public Safety, and he reports directly to its commissioner, Louis S. D'Aliso. THE Watershed Warrior long reveled in his underdog status in the county. But that era is over now, and he clearly enjoys his elevated position and expanded jurisdiction. ''I'm finally working for someone on my side,'' he said recently at his office at police headquarters in Hawthorne, flipping through a manual the size of a car battery, The Laws of Westchester County. ''I enjoy coming to work because I have bosses who endorse what I'm doing and support me. It makes the job hell of a lot easier.'' The office, which he shares with another detective, is far from plush, with stained ceiling tiles, worn carpeting and view of the parking lot. But Mr. Gatto looks like a kid at Christmas time, ticking off the job's perks: the new county helicopter, the lab facilities, having 10 detectives at his call. ''It's like going from kindergarten to high school,'' he said. ''I got everything right here at my fingertips.'' ''I got 150 police and county officials on speed dial: Watch,'' he said, pulling out his Nextel cellphone and pressing a button. ''Just testing the phone, Joey,'' he said into it. Mr. Gatto's parents were Sicilian immigrants. Everything about him seems oversized, including his Neapolitan mastiff, Big Boy, and his two vintage Chevrolet muscle cars. His wife, Faye, owns her own business installing garage doors herself. The Gattos have four children and live in Yorktown Heights. A former power lifter, he won 39 competitions and could dead-lift 770 pounds. On his left bicep is a tattoo of a police bulldog with handcuffs and a nightstick. He worked for several years as the head security guard for Richard Gere's home in Pound Ridge, but he will not dish about Mr. Gere on the record. ''With the city, Ron was protecting clean water,'' said Anthony M. Landi, commissioner of Westchester's Department of Environmental Facilities. ''Now he works with us, at the dirty water end of it.'' Actually, the job has a dual role, said Deputy Commissioner William Rehm with the county's Department of Public Safety. Mr. Gatto's role will be assessing threats to the environment, whether from terrorists or polluters, Mr. Rehm said. He said that many details about Mr. Gatto's day-to-day operations were confidential. ''Obviously in a post-9/11 world, we have directed some additional efforts toward the protection of our watershed,'' Mr. Rehm said. ''Ron's knowledge base in this area is unsurpassed. If we brought in a counter-terrorism expert from Washington, we would have had to embark on a protracted learning program to teach him about the waterways.'' Mr. Gatto will help the county interact with the city around watershed property, Mr. Rehm said, and his environmental knowledge will better inform anti-terror officials and consultants hired by the county. Mr. Gatto said he is driven to explore sewers, check out Yonkers factories or traipse through underbrush in the watershed by what he calls an aching drive to hold polluters accountable for violations. In local environmental and political circles, his record has become almost legendary. He has been called Westchester's Serpico. In 2000, he was named by Time magazine as one of nine ''Heroes for the Planet'' for his fight against polluters of watersheds regardless of their standing in political, business and power circles. ''Ron's aggressive, he's a bulldog,'' said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the senior prosecuting attorney for Riverkeeper, the Garrison-based environmental group, and a longtime friend and supporter of Mr. Gatto. He praised Mr. Gatto recently in the back room at Hanover's restaurant in Yorktown, where he was being honored for his new job. ''He can sniff out pollution like a bloodhound,'' he said. ''Ron has been fighting an uphill battle, time after time. He is a front-line enforcer.'' Mr. Spano then toasted Mr. Gatto, calling him the ''obvious guy to go to'' for environmental protection. Only now, Mr. Spano added, he has to listen to Mr. Gatto talk himself up. '''Hero of the planet,''' he joked, ''I have to listen to all this.'' George Oros, a Republican county legislator, was less happy about the appointment. He said that Mr. Spano did not consult or inform the Board of Legislators of the new position, and that there are already ample departments to perform Mr. Gatto's duties, including the city's D.E.P., the state Department of Environmental Conservation, and numerous other local officials. ''Gatto's qualifications are beyond question, but why create a position to do the same thing the state and local governments already do?'' he said. ''This is just another example of the county duplicating services offered by outside. In a time of fiscal crisis, the costs add up.'' Mr. Spano dismissed the criticism, saying: ''I don't have to ask for board review of everyone I hire. It was an administrative decision and I'm the county's administrator.'' He said that he hired Mr. Gatto precisely because he wanted to avoid relying on other agencies for vital information regarding the county. ''I wanted a unified perspective, which we didn't have, and I needed my own feedback from someone who'd been inside and had perspective and passion about the issue,'' he said. ''I can't just rely on New York City in regard to the county's environment, any more than I could with Indian Point accept what the federal government says.'' There is already a buzz in environmental and governmental circles about who has jurisdiction in environmental cases, Mr. Gatto and the county police, or District Attorney Jeanine F. Pirro's environmental unit. One political figure noted that both are known to be intense about their work and intense about receiving credit. ''It'll be interesting to see them going head to head,'' he said. ''It might be quite a turf war.'' To this, Mr. Gatto said: ''I have a job to do. The D.A.'s office prosecutes cases. I make arrests. Not to mention that I've been doing this for 20 years, before they even had an environmental unit.'' Ms. Pirro's office did not return messages seeking comment. HISTORICALLY, Westchester has lacked a central environmental protection agency, which is surprising, given that much of the county's value lies in its pristine undeveloped areas. Perennial environmental concerns in Westchester include the closure of Long Island Sound beaches because of pollution, runoff from the many highways in the county and the county airport, as well as private lawns and golf courses. Many environmentalists have long accused county and New York City leaders of environmental neglect and urged the county to take a stronger centralized role in environmental issues, including protection from rapid development. But there have been long debates over how to carry out this goal, during which proposals for various environmental protection agencies have withered. The city's watershed system is the largest unfiltered water supply in the world, and its most crucial parts -- including the reservoirs where water is held before being sent straight to city taps -- lie in Westchester. The system provides unfiltered drinking water for nine million city dwellers, including 85 percent of the county's residents. The city owns 400 square miles of watershed in the county, and is charged with protecting it. Local environmentalists, most notably Mr. Kennedy, have long accused the city of doing a poor job of protecting the watershed. But after Sept. 11, the city implemented visible security enhancements like as cameras and increased patrols, and closed the watershed to the public -- including sports fishermen with permits -- for almost a year. Then there has been jurisdictional confusion between the county and the city. Mr. Spano hopes that Mr. Gatto can help with that. Having Mr. Gatto on board will provide ''a better exchange of ideas'' between the county and city enforcement, said Mr. Rehm. In 1992, Mr. Gatto created a special enforcement unit at the Department of Environmental Protection for pursuing environmental polluters. It handled more than 1,300 investigations and made 200 arrests of major polluters during his tenure. Mr. Gatto spent years at odds with the agency. He accused city officials of making him go easy on major polluters, including developers, prisons and hospitals, and of blocking promotions for him. In 1982 in New York City, his starting salary was $11,346, and he never made much more than $55,000 there. His salary with the county is $74,510. In 1999, he filed a lawsuit against the city claiming that the city demoted and discredited him and essentially blocked him from conducting many investigations. Asked about it last week, he said that the lawsuit is still pending but that he was considering withdrawing it. Its main demand was a promotion, which he no longer wants, given his new job. Mr. Gatto patrols the county in his staff car. He keeps a chemical test kit in the trunk and visits the Health Department's labs in Valhalla frequently. Most environmental complaints to the county's hot line are fielded by the Health Department, which then determines whether to send out one of its 11 environmental health inspectors in response. According to Dr. Joshua Lipsman, commissioner of the county's Health Department, environmental complaints range from a chemical leak at a Yonkers factory to an overturned oil truck on the New York State Thruway. There can be an anthrax scare at a White Plains office building, or dead fish in the Hudson River. In January, Mr. Gatto helped arrest a contractor who allegedly broke thermometers and did not report spilled mercury from them at the County Medical Center There were roughly 2,000 environmental spills reported last year, roughly half of which the department determined needed a response by an inspector. PREVIOUSLY, the department could only give summonses for violations of the county's health code, which require an appearance at later date at the department's administrative hearing officers in New Rochelle. This did not give the department much immediate enforcement power, he said, because a polluter can continue to dump while waiting for the hearing and simply pay the fine as a cost of doing business. ''When a law is broken, you want to call the police,'' he explained. ''With the specialized nature of environmental incidents, it's very desirable to be able to call a police officer who knows what he's dealing with.'' ''If the officials determine that there is a serious crime or culpability, they'll give Ron's office a call, and he'll meet them there,'' said Dr. Lipsman. Mr. Gatto will help the county's Department of Environmental Facilities monitor pollution of the county sewer system, which includes 40 pump stations and 200 miles of ''main trunk'' sewer lines. These connect to sewer lines in local municipalities, which maintain them. For example, Yonkers has 1,100 miles of local sewer lines, while Port Chester has 52 miles, Mr. Landi said. He helps monitor pollutants in the roughly 500,000 tons of garbage a year that the department carts from the county's four transfer stations (in Mount Vernon, White Plains, Yonkers and Peekskill) to the Peekskill plant where it is incinerated and converted into energy. Mr. Gatto is charged with helping monitor the seven sewage treatment plants in Westchester that the runs. The plants, in Yonkers, Ossining, Peekskill, Port Chester, Rye, Mamaroneck and New Rochelle, handle the county's 13 sewer districts. Like Mr. Lipsman, Mr. Landi said that his capacity for enforcing environmental laws had always been limited, since he mostly relied on summonses issued by Health Department inspectors and one enforcement officer from his department who was not empowered to arrest violators. ''Meanwhile, they can continue to pollute,'' he said. ''But once a guy gets arrested, he'll sure think twice before doing it again. ''We needed someone with real enforcement powers,'' he said. ''We know when something is not right, and we can do our investigation, but now Ron can come in and take the right measure and bring things to the surface.'' As far as commercial dumping, businesses are assessed by the county's Department of Facilities and told how to treat their waste before disposing it. But, Mr. Landi said, many businesses try to avoid the cost of this by secretly dumping into waterways. To combat this type of polluter, Mr. Gatto assumes one of his many roles with the county: sewer sleuth. At the Peekskill plant, he climbed down from the ledge and told a good dirty water story. A few weeks earlier, he was looking at this same brown rivulet, drainage from Peekskill's sewer system. He saw some fluorescent gray liquid flowing into the plant and suspected that it was being dumped by an industrial polluter. Since these things have to be tracked the old-fashioned way, Mr. Gatto got his chemical test kit from his trunk, and called several Health Department inspectors. They began tracking the liquid by opening manhole covers, one by one, testing the sewage and homing in on the source. It led them to a large industrial Laundromat in Peekskill. Mr. Gatto ordered the company manager to stop dumping, and served him with a summons for violating county pollution ordinances. ''Like I said, who else but the Warrior?'' he said."
"The Energy Department has asked Congress to allow it to redefine some nuclear waste so it can be left in place or sent to sites intended for low-level radioactive material, rather than being buried deep underground. Department officials say they thought they had flexibility in classifying what constituted high-level nuclear waste, but in July, a federal district judge in Idaho ruled that the department's plan for treating waste there violated the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, a 1982 law requiring the deep burial of high-level waste. The argument concerns tens of millions of gallons of salts and sludges left over from weapons production that are now in tanks in Idaho, South Carolina and eastern Washington. High-level waste is supposed to be encapsulated in glass for burial. The department has chosen Yucca Mountain, Nev., as the repository site, but the site has not yet opened and when it does, it will not be big enough for all the solidified wastes and spent reactor fuel. In the Idaho case, the Energy Department had said that some of the high-level waste was ''incidental'' and need not be removed from the tanks. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Snake River Alliance, a local environmental group, along with two Indian tribes, successfully argued that the order violated a longtime policy that high-level waste must be deeply buried. The ruling also could affect waste from a defunct civilian reprocessing plant in West Valley, N.Y., near Buffalo. The waste has already been solidified, and department officials said Tuesday that the resulting glass logs would be shipped for deep burial. But the officials said that contaminated buildings and equipment there might be left on site. ''This is D.O.E.'s attempt to pawn off highly contaminated stuff on the state,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said on Tuesday. ''We are fighting it.'' Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, the ranking minority member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said that ''if the D.O.E. has the authority to change the classification of the waste at will, that pretty much undercuts any Congressional control of the issue.'' Mr. Bingaman said that one result could be wastes being shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, near Carlsbad, N.M., that did not belong there. A department official said, however, that it would not change what was acceptable at the Carlsbad plant, which is designed for plutonium and other long-lived materials. The Energy Department asked Congressional leaders in August for the authority to decide what constituted nuclear waste. A spokeswoman for the energy committee, Marnie Funk, said on Tuesday that the committee's Republican majority would not accept the Energy Department language, but opponents said that was just one of a series of proposals that the department would make. Spencer Abraham, the secretary of energy, said in August in a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert that the Idaho case could mean decades of delay in removing the waste from the tanks, and cleanup costs could be 10 to 100 times higher than the $39 billion now estimated. An Energy Department official said the ruling had left the department paralyzed. ''The district court decision doesn't say which of the stuff from reprocessing has to go to Yucca Mountain,'' the official said. Tom Cochran, a nuclear expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, ''Basically what they're doing is allowing the D.O.E. to abandon high-level waste and treat it under standards written for low-level waste.''"
"Federal and New Jersey officials said yesterday that they had embarked on a $19 million partnership to study pollution in a heavily industrialized section of the lower Passaic River. The study, scheduled to take five years, will serve as a prelude to a cleanup of the 17-mile section of the Passaic from the Paterson area to Newark Bay, Jane M. Kenny, the regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said during a news conference in Newark with officials from the Army Corps of Engineers and the state's environmental and transportation departments. For decades, the lower section of the river has been a dumping ground for toxic pollutants like dioxin, mercury, PCB's, DDT, heavy metals and pesticides. The contamination has been so severe that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has banned fishing and discouraged swimming. ''Working together, we can make the Passaic a showcase for urban river restoration,'' Ms. Kenny said. The state environmental commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, said communities along the lower Passaic had waited too long for a cleanup. He said the federal-state partnership would speed that process. No timetable was given yesterday for the start of the cleanup. But officials said the work could start before the scheduled end of the study in 2008 if officials developed a sound understanding of the depth of toxic sediments and how and where they are drifting. The new study will broaden a recent E.P.A. study of a 6-mile section of the 17-mile stretch near the former Diamond Alkali Company site in Newark. It is now a federal Superfund site, contaminated with dioxin that seeped into the river for years, officials said. The E.P.A. will provide $10 million from its Superfund program to finance about half the cost of the study. The remaining $9 million will come from the Army Corps of Engineers and the state."
"In the power corridors of Silicon Valley, Amanda Hawes and Ted Smith could be called the antipower couple. Theirs is a marriage of common crusades against some of the region's biggest companies. In a trial widely followed in the valley, Ms. Hawes, a lawyer who specializes in occupational health cases, is helping to represent two retired I.B.M. electronics factory workers who say they have cancer because the company knowingly exposed them to hazardous chemicals. Her husband, Mr. Smith, who is also a lawyer, founded the nonprofit Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition more than two decades ago and has been one of the valley's most dogged environmental activist ever since. Whether in this trial, or in any number of other cases that one or the other of the couple has been involved with over the years, the Smith-Hawes view of the manufacturing processes in Silicon Valley might be simply stated: The places where chips, circuit boards and hard disks are made may be known as clean rooms, but that does not mean they are necessarily safe places to work. In this region where so much of the economy depends on designing or making electronics, the couple's activism has not made them universally popular. Married 29 years, Ms. Hawes, who is 60, and Mr. Smith, 58, are established residents of the valley, having sent their three children, now grown, through San Jose public schools and having taken their places alongside their neighbors at many a children's soccer game over the years. (One of their children, Kyle Smith, 25, is now a professional soccer player with the Seattle Sounders.) But they say that, especially during the 1980's, they were careful never to mention their children outside of their circle of friends or to give out their home address. Mr. Smith says the family has received threatening phone calls and mail, and both his home and office have been vandalized. ''It's the nature of the beast,'' he said, ''and what happens to people who stick their necks out.'' Executives in the chip industry tend to resent and dispute the couple's accusations that the industry has compromised the health and safety of workers. Many maintain that Mr. Smith simply does not know enough about how semiconductor manufacturing works to be making such claims. ''It's ludicrous for someone to say we've been irresponsible with our workers,'' said Jeff Weir, a spokesman for the National Semiconductor Corporation, who worked for the Semiconductor Industry Association in the 1990's. ''I think it's injurious to the industry and irresponsible.'' He added: ''Where did Ted Smith get his information about chip companies? I don't think he has any.'' And some people in the chip industry have questioned the propriety of the couple's professional relationship, with Mr. Smith's nonprofit group sending business to Ms. Hawes's firm, a criticism Mr. Smith describes as yet another effort to discredit their work. For Ms. Hawes, the I.B.M. case is the culmination of years of preparation. The trial is being closely watched by the local and national media, and has even received attention in Europe, where workers in Scotland have filed a similar suit against National Semiconductor. Legal experts say an outcome in favor of the I.B.M. workers would very likely lead to other liability suits throughout the industry. Although Ms. Hawes's law partner, Richard Alexander, is the courtroom litigator, they spent months jointly preparing for the case, and she has been with him at the plaintiffs' table each day since the trial opened on Nov. 5 in Santa Clara County Superior Court. In its defense, I.B.M. is arguing that the workers' illnesses could have been caused by many factors other than chemical exposure at work, and that the company did not conceal any information from the employees. So far, the jury of 11 women and one man has heard testimony from the retirees, James Moore and Alida Hernandez, and I.B.M.'s lead lawyer, Robert Weber, has nearly finished his cross examination. As for Mr. Smith, whose campaigns have helped earn Santa Clara County the distinction of being the home of more federally designated Superfund toxic cleanup sites than any other county in the United States, his coalition is now confronting the computer industry over the nation's growing accumulation of discarded computer equipment. The group is calling for more and safer recycling programs. Last spring, the coalition was instrumental in Dell's decision to stop using prison labor in its recycling program. Mr. Smith's group had said that the workers were exposed to hazardous materials and that the PC industry needed a more formal, long-term approach to recycling. Those who worry about toxic chemicals see the business of Silicon Valley as being fraught with peril. To make a single six-inch-wide silicon wafer disk requires 20 pounds of chemicals, 22 cubic feet of hazardous gases and 2,275 gallons of water, according to Mr. Smith's coalition, and the byproducts include 7 gallons of hazardous waste. Likewise, computer manufacturing typically involves as many as 1,000 different materials, many of which are toxic, according to the coalition. Too little is known, Mr. Smith says, about the hundreds of chemicals used in the industry -- a problem he says is compounded as more electronics manufacturing moves to foreign countries where economics often overshadows environmental issues. Mr. Smith and Ms. Hawes have been confronting big business their entire careers, although the corporate targets were different when they met nearly 30 years ago -- she a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, he of Stanford Law School. Back then Santa Clara County was primarily agricultural and known affectionately as the Valley of Heart's Desire. It was perhaps the perfect setting for two idealistic young lawyers, who had taken up the cause of cannery workers, to fall in love and get married. As the technology foundries of the nascent semiconductor industry began to replace the canneries in the early 1970's, Ms. Hawes founded the Santa Clara Center for Occupational Safety and Health. Soon, she said, she began meeting electronics workers with signs of chemical sensitivity, including skin rashes. ''It was very discouraging,'' she said, ''to find how few legal options there were for people who endanger themselves at their jobs.'' As more technology companies began sprouting up around residential neighborhoods in San Jose, Mountain View and other towns, the potential environmental effects became a topic of public discussion. One galvanizing event was the discovery in 1982 that an underground tank at Fairchild Semiconductor in San Jose was leaking industrial solvents into the ground water. Living in San Jose with three children, the youngest only a year old, the couple's concerns were as personal as they were political. ''Suddenly, overnight, people said, ''Oh, my God, this could be my drinking water,''' recalled Mr. Smith, who was working at a small private law firm at the time. Mr. Smith recalls his first meeting with officials of the Environmental Protection Agency, where he presented his findings and public petitions seeking action on ground water contamination. ''They looked stunned,'' Mr. Smith said. ''They'd apparently bought into the 'clean industry' myth, like the rest of them.'' The E.P.A. responded and began designating pollution sites throughout Silicon Valley as so-called Superfund sites -- polluted areas eligible for federally financed cleanup. The valley now has 29 Superfund sites. ''I thought at the time it would be a short-term thing and I would go back to practicing law,'' Mr. Smith said. Instead, his effort, which led to the formation of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition in 1982, has continued, and his is considered perhaps the loudest voice on the region's environmental issues. ''Ted would be the first person anyone would call,'' said James Puckett, founder of the Basel Action Network, an environmental group in Seattle that has worked closely with Mr. Smith's on toxic waste issues. ''He takes a hard line without being shrill.'' Mr. Smith says that the technology industry has recently been much more attuned to environmental issues. Relationships that used to be adversarial have turned more collegial, he said. ''They've finally realized that it's cheaper to prevent pollution than clean it up.''"
"The worst has been removed from this industrial city's largest hazardous waste site. Barrels of chemicals have been carted away. Contaminated front yards have been stripped and covered with fresh sod. The rusty buildings where rats and homeless men took shelter have been demolished and removed. Three years ago, a chain-link fence with barbed wire was put around the site, the former home of Continental Steel, a Kokomo manufacturer that went bankrupt in 1986. Since then, the city has been waiting for the federal government to finish the cleanup. But the money for the Superfund program, which restores the nation's worst abandoned toxic waste sites, has not kept pace. Kokomo officials have been told for two years that the full cleanup is not being paid for and they fear that the delay will continue indefinitely. A three-inch-thick redevelopment plan sits on the shelves of the downtown library. And the city, which is trying to revitalize itself by building brick gazebos and renovating condominiums downtown, has a toxic site centrally located along one of its busiest roads. Kokomo's Continental Steel site is only one in a big backlog of hazardous waste sites that has emerged over the last several years as Superfund dollars have been stretched thin. Seven sites could not start final cleanup in 2002. Last year, that number rose to 10. The backlog for final cleanups is likely to grow as cleanups already in place consume a greater share of the available money, say officials at the Environmental Protection Agency. Superfund appropriations have hovered around $1.2 billion a year over the last two years, down from $1.6 billion in 1999. While the immediate and visible hazards are gone, Kokomo residents say they still worry. The final cleanup plan includes a full dredging of the creek beds, since the sediments of the nearby creeks are still contaminated with PCB's. An advisory says the fish in the creek are not fit to be eaten, but most of the warning signs are long gone -- blown away by storms or vandalized. Many young people, who have only vague memories of the strong smells and toxic dust cast by the steel mill, fish in the creek regularly. The rock quarry is still contaminated, and the acid lagoons, once dry, fill up regularly with rainwater. Neighbors complain about a rusty, moldy smell that they say comes from the site in the summer. Four-story black slag heaps sit between the creek and a main road. ''I feel abandoned,'' said Carolyn Kauble, who lives in a modest house one block away from the site. Her husband, Phillip, died this year of cancer, having lived 60 years in the neighborhood. Before his death, Mr. Kauble, who had worked at Continental Steel, helped galvanize local and federal governments to begin cleaning up the site. ''It's been 14 years, and we haven't given up,'' Ms. Kauble said. ''It's not completed. It's not done. It's not safe.'' She still keeps blue crates, stacked four and five high, with reams of her husband's documents on the Continental Steel site. Kokomo's cleanup is delayed because federal officials do not consider pollution here severe enough to deserve high priority. ''They feel like they've taken care of the imminent threat,'' said Jolene Rule, a local environmental leader. E.P.A. officials say that the lower numbers of cleanups reflect the complexity of Superfund operations. Cleanups have become more difficult, time consuming and expensive, leaving less money for the remaining cleanups to enter the final stage. Eight large sites are taking up 40 percent of the budget devoted to final cleanup. ''We just have fewer dollars to start new projects,'' said Marianne Horinko, an associate administrator of the E.P.A. who oversees toxic cleanup. But money for cleanups may be tighter now that the industry-supported portion of Superfund, a trust created to clean up ''orphaned'' toxic sites, will essentially be depleted this year after hitting a high of almost $4.6 billion in 1996, according to recent projections by the General Accounting Office. Now cleanup funds must come from general Congressional appropriations, competing with other domestic needs. Environmental groups and Democratic senators have called for the reinstatement of the original corporate taxes that filled the Superfund coffers, which expired in 1995. But the Bush administration and industry have resisted, saying the taxes burden companies that do not pollute. To clear the backlog, the administration has asked Congress for $150 million in additional funds -- enough to jump-start 10 to 15 new cleanups. However, the Senate and the House have each appropriated only $30 million to $40 million of that request. In the four generations that the hulking Continental Steel buildings stood out against Kokomo's skyline, people coped with the red soot that snowed down regularly on their houses and cars. At one point Continental Steel, founded in 1914, employed 2,700 people in a city that currently has 46,000 residents. But then the company went bankrupt. Instead of economic vitality, Continental Steel now symbolizes eyesores and headaches for city planners and neighbors alike. Neighbors requested that the environmental cleanup leave up one wall on the weed-covered lot, to shield the residents from the view and any blowing debris. ''They carried the ball to the 90-yard line,'' said John Rawlings, who lives near the site. ''They have to carry it 10 more yards that are the toughest part, and they backed off.''"
"In what environmental activists in India are hailing as a major victory, tons of hazardous waste from an abandoned thermometer factory owned by India's largest consumer products company, Hindustan Lever Ltd., is heading to a recycling plant in the United States for safe disposal. About 300 tons of mercury-contaminated material and waste from the thermometer plant in Kodaikanal town, in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu, will be shipped to the United States. A ship carrying the material is expected to dock in New York on May 29. The waste shipment is headed to Bethlehem Apparatus Company, in Hellertown, Pa., the world's largest mercury recycling facility. Ameer Shahul, the corporate campaign coordinator for Greenpeace India, termed the shipment ''reverse dumping,'' referring to a reversal of earlier instances in which hazardous material has been shipped from the developed world to poorer countries. Prolonged protests from environmental activists led to the closing of the Hindustan Lever plant two years ago. Hindustan Lever is a subsidiary of Unilever. ''We have forced the company to send back hazardous material from a poor country like India, an event that doesn't happen too often,'' said V. R. Rajagopal Dorairajah, a member of Palani Hills Conservation Council, one of the conservation groups involved in the dispute. ''This is a big win for us.'' Mercury is a heavy metal that is very toxic even in small doses. Exposure to mercury can lead to damage of the brain, spinal cord, kidneys and liver. India has no recycling facilities for mercury-contaminated material. On Wednesday, the ship carrying several containers of contaminants from the plant, including waste glass tainted with mercury, effluent sludge, thermometers and metallic mercury, will leave Tuticorin port, about 200 miles south of the city of Madras in southeastern India. Greenpeace activists who joined local environmental groups to campaign against the plant are closely monitoring the hazardous cargo. Hindustan Lever confirmed the shipment. The waste was transported by road to the southern port under police supervision during daylight hours, the company said. The thermometer factory was acquired by Hindustan Lever from Pond's India Ltd., a cosmetics maker. Pond's moved the factory to India from the United States after the plant owned there by its parent, Chesebrough-Pond's, had been dismantled. The mercury for the thermometers was imported, primarily from the United States, and finished thermometers were exported to markets in the United States and Europe. The thermometer plant operated for nearly two decades in Kodaikanal, a popular summer resort dating back to the colonial period. Hindustan Lever said it was taking action to remediate contaminated soil according to stringent international regulations. It is currently seeking approval of its remediation plan by the Tamil Nadu pollution control board before it starts the process, the company said. Environmental activists have charged that mercury vapor released from the factory has impaired the health of the workers and community, a charge that Hindustan Lever vehemently denies."
"An afternoon sun shone on the sands of Hudson Park and Harbor Island beaches in Westchester County yesterday, and the sparkling water beckoned raucous children and veteran sunbathers. But red-lettered signs at both public beaches proclaimed, ''Water Closed by Order of Health Dept.'' and ''No Swimming.'' Or simply, ''Beach Closed.'' Only a gaggle of geese and several ducklings paddled in the water lapping at the beach. The humans stayed on the sand and watched. On Friday, the Westchester County Department of Health recommended the closing of both beaches to swimmers for at least the weekend because of fears of raw sewage in the waters at Harbor Island, in Mamaroneck, and a rise in dangerous bacteria at Hudson Park, in New Rochelle. ''This is crazy,'' Margaret Chadwick, 41, of New Rochelle said as she lounged on a lawn chair on Hudson Park Beach and gestured toward the Echo Bay inlet. ''This has to stop. This is a magnificent body of water, and we get to stare at it.'' Residents and lifeguards said Hudson Park Beach was closed several times last summer because of sewage problems. Water troubles have plagued both beaches in recent years, but Harbor Island has endured constant challenges. Three years ago, the waters were declared off limits because of high levels of coliform bacteria. The most common of those bacteria is E. coli, which can cause severe intestinal problems when swallowed, said Joshua Lipsman, the Westchester County commissioner of health. As a remedy, the village of Mamaroneck acquired a Gunderboom, a giant curtainlike structure inserted around the beach's swimming area as a bacteria filter. But a 1,200-gallon fuel leak from a boat destroyed the first Gunderboom shortly after its installation, said Phil Trifiletti, the mayor of Mamaroneck. The replacement Gunderboom, a dark green mass that measures 800 feet to 900 feet and cost $135,000, was installed in the fall and functioned well, Mr. Trifiletti said. And so, two weeks ago, the waters of Harbor Island opened to swimmers for the first time in three years. But on Friday, when officials found out that a roughly 80-year-old sewage pipe had begun leaking into the rainwater that runs into the Mamaroneck Harbor, the village closed off the waters again. ''It's a little frustrating,'' Mr. Trifiletti said, adding that the village planned to identify and replace any weak sewer pipes. ''It's not easy to get it perfect the first time, but we will get there.'' Many would-be waders were reduced to using showers, water jets and cups of water for cool comfort yesterday. Most of them reluctantly complied with the orders to avoid the water, though Melissa Monik, 21, the head lifeguard at Hudson Park, said some beachgoers had argued with her. ''The water looks so clean,'' said Ms. Monik, of New Rochelle. ''It's so hard to explain.'' Dr. Lipsman attributed the closings of the waters at the two public beaches, and four private beaches in Mamaroneck, to location and urban activity. The beaches, nestled in the belly of inlets, receive little water from Long Island Sound, he said. In addition, the extraordinary amount of rain last month washed a lot of organic waste from the streets into the swimming areas, Dr. Lipsman said. But beachgoers baking under the sun showed an eagerness to take to the water -- especially the younger ones. Clothed in a sporty pink two-piece swimsuit, Daniella Granata, 5, traveled with her father, Vincent, 36, and brother Nicholas, 3, from their Yonkers home, hoping to jump into the inlet at the Harbor Island beach. ''I felt sad because I wanted to go into the water,'' Daniella said. Instead, she and Nicholas spent some time in the sprayground, a play area filled with giant water guns and fountains. Mr. Trifiletti said he hoped that the village would fix the sewage pipe leak within 10 days and that Harbor Island Beach would reopen in two weeks. Because the Department of Health cannot pinpoint the source of the bacteria in Hudson Park, that beach will remained closed indefinitely, Dr. Lipsman said."
"Given all the people who work and shop under the el on Liberty Avenue between Lefferts Boulevard and 89th Street in Ozone Park, Queens, competition for parking is normally fierce. But not lately. ''It's like a ghost town on this block,'' said Renée Christensen, a dog groomer who works at the Dog House on Liberty Avenue near 93rd Street. That is because word has gotten out about the paint-corroding goo that falls from the train tracks onto cars parked along these 30 or so blocks. Ms. Christensen's Nissan Ultima was hit two months ago. ''Every time a train comes by, it drips this grease and you can't get it off,'' she said. ''After it dried, I noticed my paint on my hood starting to chip.'' The goo is creosote, said Charles Seaton, a spokesman for New York City Transit. New wooden railroad ties are soaked in creosote, a tarlike substance, to preserve them from weathering. The city installed the new ties along this section of the el at the beginning of the year, he said, but the creosote had not fully dried when the abundant rains of spring and summer began. ''The heavy rains inundated the ties and the creosote started dripping,'' he said. The city covered the ties with cloth sheeting that soon became saturated and leaked the sticky brown liquid. Mr. Seaton said agency workers are now wrapping the ties in burlap, which seems to be working better. He said claims for reimbursement for damage can be filed with New York City Transit. Ms. Christensen can hardly wait for the dripping to go away. Two weeks ago, she parked on a part of Liberty Avenue that someone had advised her was a no-goo zone, but to no avail. ''I got it on the hood,'' she said. ''I was really upset because I had finally gotten my car cleaned from the last time.'' The problem has made her job a bit harder, too. She said she had had to de-goo dogs that were hit while walking from their owners' cars to her store. So, can dogs apply to the city for reimbursement? ''That's a good question,'' Mr. Seaton said, ''but I would imagine that they could.'' JIM O'GRADY NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: OZONE PARK, QUEENS"
"Concerned that pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children could be exposed to unsafe levels of mercury, the federal government took steps yesterday to caution people in these groups that they should limit the amount of tuna they eat. The warning on tuna is part of an updated draft advisory from the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Earlier drafts had suggested avoiding shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish altogether because they contain levels of mercury that can damage the developing nervous system. But the latest draft, presented at a meeting in Washington yesterday, was the first to specifically address eating tuna, one of the most popular type of fish in the United States. The advisory recommends a limit of two to three meals, or 12 ounces, of fish and shellfish each week. It also suggests that pregnant women and young children mix the types of fish and shellfish they eat and restrict each to no more than once a week. ''We're trying to be more specific with our recommendations,'' said Dr. David Acheson, chief medical officer of the science office at the food agency. ''Tuna is just one of those fish that it's safest to eat in moderation, in this case four to six ounces of it a week.'' The advisory also points out that tuna steak and canned albacore generally have more mercury than canned light tuna. According to the agency, canned albacore, often called white tuna, has nearly three times as much mercury as canned light tuna. Many studies, though not all, have found that even low levels of mercury can produce subtle negative effects, and consumer and environmental groups have for years pressured the food agency to do more to warn the public about mercury in tuna and other fish. ''In the United States, 30 to 50 percent of women of childbearing age are not even aware that mercury in fish presents an exposure to risk,'' said Michael T. Bender, director of the Mercury Policy Project in Montpelier, Vt. Several industry groups are concerned that the latest advisory might fuel irrational public fears that fish is unsafe to eat in any amount. As a result, some groups are saying, it is extremely important that the agency emphasize that fish is not only safe in certain quantities, but is generally a healthy food. Dr. Acheson said the food agency still had several areas of research to pursue before a final draft of the advisory was prepared in the spring. Several subspecies of fish in the current advisory, he pointed out, generally have different levels of mercury. ''We need to clarify some things, like the suggested portion sizes and the specific body weight information for children,'' he said."
"The Bush administration is proposing that mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants should not be regulated in the same way as some of the most toxic air pollutants, reversing a stance on air pollution control taken by the Clinton administration in 2000. The change in planned regulations for mercury emissions from power plants is summarized in documents from the Environmental Protection Agency and is the first big policy decision by Michael O. Leavitt, who took over as the agency's administrator last month. The agency is suggesting that mercury emissions be removed from the most stringent regulations of the Clean Air Act that have been used to limit the most toxic air pollutants. Among those are asbestos, chromium and lead, which have been known to cause cancers and neurological disorders. The administration proposal would make legally mandated mercury regulation fall under a less stringent section of the Clean Air Act that governs pollutants like those that cause smog and acid rain, which are not as toxic to humans. The administration says this would be a more efficient and faster way to reduce mercury in the environment. The E.P.A. documents were provided to The New York Times by environmental groups that are critical of the latest agency proposals. Currently mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants are not yet regulated under federal law. These power plants release about 48 tons of mercury into the air each year, or about 40 percent of the total human-caused mercury emissions in the country, the agency estimates. The upcoming regulations have been the subject of intense lobbying by utilities that argue the rules would force them to switch to more expensive fuels or install costly equipment on power plants to reduce the amount of mercury being spewed into the air. ''If you were to regulate mercury in an overly inflexible way, the result would be substantial fuel switching from coal to natural gas,'' said Scott Segal, the spokesman for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, an industry group formed by some of the largest energy companies. The group welcomed the looser interpretation for mercury. ''The Clean Air Act is flexible and pragmatic enough to have different reservoirs or authority for dealing with mercury,'' Mr. Segal said. Under the proposal submitted to the White House last week, power plants would be able to buy and sell the rights to emit mercury into the air. A similar trading of emission credits is currently in use to handle sulfur dioxide, the pollutant that is a component of acid rain. In addition, the agency's proposal would push back the effective date of the new regulations to 2010 at the earliest. Mr. Leavitt argued that a market-based system was an efficient compromise that would reduce mercury emissions in a way that did not place a financial burden on utility companies. ''By exploring the alternative, we can gain substantially more progress than under command and control,'' he said. Environmental groups criticize the market-based proposal, saying it would allow hot spots of mercury contamination to build up. Mercury, a known neurotoxin, accumulates in the environment and builds up in the tissue of fish and the species, including humans, that eat them. It is considered particularly hazardous for pregnant women because of the developmental effects on fetuses. ''Mercury is a serious public health threat,'' said Carol M. Browner, who served as E.P.A. administrator under President Bill Clinton. ''We were regulating it; we were on track to keep it regulated. This reverses that and puts the public health at risk.'' The E.P.A. is facing a deadline of Dec. 15 to release a public proposal to regulate mercury, the result of a legal settlement between the Clinton administration and environmental groups, due to go into effect in December 2007. If the new buying-and-selling of mercury credits proposal is not adopted, the E.P.A. also submitted a regulatory plan under the more stringent rules controlling toxic air pollutants at each power plant. This is the administration's second major policy shift on power plant regulations in the last month, both of which have come after extensive industry lobbying. In November, E.P.A.'s chief of enforcement, J. P. Suarez, told his staff that the agency would stop pursuing Clean Air Act enforcement cases against coal-burning power plants."
"Last week a quietly scathing report by the inspector general of the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed what some have long suspected: in the aftermath of the World Trade Center's collapse, the agency systematically misled New Yorkers about the risks the resulting air pollution posed to their health. And it did so under pressure from the White House. The Bush administration has misled the public on many issues, from the budget outlook to the Iraqi threat. But this particular deception seems, at first sight, not just callous but gratuitous. It's only when you look back at budget politics in 2001 that you see the method in the administration's mendacity. A draft E.P.A. report released last December conceded that 9/11 had led to huge emissions of pollutants. In particular, releases of dioxins -- which are carcinogens and can also damage the nervous system and cause birth defects -- created ''likely the highest ambient concentrations that have ever been reported,'' up to 1,500 times normal levels. But the report concluded that because the outdoor air cleared after a couple of months, little harm had been done. In fact, the main danger comes from toxic dust that seeped into buildings and remains in carpets, furniture and air ducts. According to a recent report in Salon, businesses that did environmental assessments of their own premises found alarming levels not just of dioxins but also of asbestos and other dangerous pollutants. So the most shocking revelation from the new report is that under White House direction, the E.P.A. suppressed warnings about indoor pollution. Scattered evidence suggests that as a result, hundreds of cleaning workers and thousands of residents may be suffering chronic health problems. Why was crucial information withheld from the public? The report mentions ''the desire to reopen Wall Street and national security concerns.'' Maybe -- though the national security benefits of failing to remove toxic dust escape me. I suspect that there was another reason: budget politics. Immediately after 9/11 there was a great national outpouring of sympathy for New York, and a natural inclination to provide generous help. President Bush quickly promised $20 billion, and everyone expected the federal government to assume the burden of additional security. Yet hard-line Republicans never wanted to help the stricken city. Indeed, according to an article by Michael Tomasky in New York magazine, Senators Phil Gramm and Don Nickles attempted to slash aid to New York within hours of Mr. Bush's promise. Matters were patched up sufficiently so Mr. Bush could make his triumphant appearance at ground zero the next day. But then the backtracking began. By February 2002, only a fraction of the promised funds had been allocated -- and Mitch Daniels, the White House budget director, accused New York's lawmakers of playing ''money-grubbing games.'' Why this stinginess? A source told Mr. Tomasky that ''Gramm just doesn't like spending money. And Nickles . . . he's just anti-New York.'' That sums it up: even after 9/11, hard-line conservatives opposed any spending, no matter how justified, that wasn't on weapons or farm subsidies, while some people from America's ''red states'' just hate big-city folk. What does all this have to do with toxic dust? Think how much harder it would have been to stiff New York if the public had understood the extent to which Lower Manhattan had become a hazardous waste site. I can't prove that was what administration officials were thinking, but otherwise their efforts to play down the risks seem incomprehensible. In the end, New York seems to have gotten its $20 billion -- barely. As for the additional help everyone expected: don't get me started. There wasn't a penny of federal aid for ''first responders'' -- like those firefighters and police officers who cheered Mr. Bush at ground zero -- until a few months ago, and much of it went to sparsely populated states. The federal government spends much more protecting the average resident of Wyoming from terrorists than it spends protecting the average resident of New York City. All in all, the people running Washington, while eager to invoke 9/11 on behalf of whatever they feel like doing, have treated the city that bore the brunt of the actual attack very shabbily. In September 2004 the Republicans will hold their nominating convention in New York. Will New Yorkers take the occasion to remind them about how the city was lied to and shortchanged?

"Q. A neighbor lost her husband to a brain infection called fungal cerebral mucormycosis. What is it? A. Luckily this is a rare problem; it comes from certain kinds of very common funguses that may be inhaled or swallowed by almost anyone anywhere. In a few susceptible people, the funguses may take hold of the lining of the mouth or nasal tract, or mucosa, and multiply, moving in a very short time to the brain and sometimes to other organs by way of the bloodstream. Death rates are high, especially when surgery to remove the fungal masses and infiltrated tissues and treatment with antifungal drugs are not undertaken soon enough. Susceptibility is usually linked to a severely weakened immune system and to certain metabolic disorders; as many as 75 percent of American victims of the disease have poorly controlled diabetes, one study found. In people with healthy immune systems, the fungus spores are rapidly encased by special immune cells and are soon expelled from the body, with no harm done. In those with the metabolic disorders, the body's chemistry changes in ways that either hamper the immune cells or provide a favorable environment for the fungus to multiply. High levels of acidity and iron contribute to such an environment. Iron is taken in by the fungus and used to help it maintain its cells; acidity in the bloodstream seems to make more iron available to the fungus. C. CLAIBORNE RAY Q & A"
"For about 40 years, Dye Specialties Inc.'s nine low-slung brick industrial buildings at the end of a long block of homes here have given the area an often unwanted distinction. Whenever it snowed, a fine, purple dust from the ink plant would settle on the new snow, coloring its Clark Street environs violet or lavender when everything else was blanketed in white. On other days, when the wind was just right, the fine purple dust -- a harmless anti-fungal powder used in coloring the company's indelible inks -- would drift up the block, settling on parked cars and on laundry that had been hung out to dry. Today, the plant brought another unwanted distinction to the area when firefighters descended on Clark Street in response to a fire alarm at the plant. There was no fire, as it turned out, but emergency workers found something equally troubling. More than 200 barrels of chemicals that emergency officials said could be hazardous had been left stacked in two buildings at Dye Specialties, which has been closed since June. Hazardous materials workers are removing the barrels. Mayor Glenn Cunningham said that none of the barrels were leaking and therefore did not amount to a serious hazard for the nearly 400 homes nearby. But he added that some of the barrels contained phosphorous oxychloride, which is highly toxic and could be dangerous if it escaped from corroded or damaged barrels. Inspectors also found traces of liquid phosgene. In its gaseous form, the chemical is the lethal component in mustard gas. Fire officials said that the phosgene was used in its liquid form in the ink-making process, and that the traces were found on the equipment used in that process. No phosgene beyond those traces was found in the plant, according to Mayor Cunningham and other officials. ''It was considered a weapon of mass destruction in World War I and World War II,'' the Jersey City fire chief, George Johns, said of the phosgene. Chief Johns said that the owner told him that he had closed the plant because security concerns that had intensified since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, had forced up the price of the phosgene. Competing ink manufacturers overseas had undercut the owner's prices, the chief said. The owner of the factory, Robert Lindley, of Glen Ridge, was arrested yesterday on charges that he had closed the plant without paying his 40 or so employees the wages that they were owed. Mr. Lindley was released from jail today on $50,000 bail. A call to his home went unanswered. But neighbors of the plant, local officials and at least one former employee were surprised by Dye Specialties' problems and by the allegations against Mr. Lindley. Chief Johns said that the plant had a good environmental record over the years and that Mr. Lindley had cooperated fully with the city when it held emergency drills at the plant amid its pumps, drying ovens, vats and filtration units. Henry Mulicki, who has lived on the block next to the plant for 35 years, said the plant and its workers had been good neighbors over the years. He said the workers were friendly and stopped to talk to residents. Whenever the purple dust settled on cars, Mr. Lindley would tell residents to bring them to the plant yard, where he would have workers wash them, Mr. Mulicki said. Although the plant often produced a bad odor, Tom Carlis, 75, who has lived on the block for 45 years, said that plant owners would pay for the cleaning of any clothing that became covered with the purple dust while hanging out to dry. ''But I am happy they are closed,'' Mr. Carlis said."
"The City Council pushed through tough new legislation on lead paint hazards yesterday, overriding a veto by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and overcoming opposition from health officials, landlords and advocates for low-income housing. The legislation, which is expected to take effect within six months, will regulate the removal of lead paint hazards, including dust, and require owners and landlords of apartments built before 1960 to identify all children under age 7 living inside those units every year. Council Speaker Gifford Miller said the law would protect the city's children from lead poisoning while allowing landlords flexibility in complying with the new standards. Mr. Miller, who is widely expected to run against Mr. Bloomberg in 2005, also chided the mayor for vetoing the legislation. ''His veto would leave countless of the city's most poor and most defenseless and most vulnerable without protection,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Today, the Council corrects that wrong and together we speak on behalf of those whose voice does not often reach City Hall.'' Council members voted 44 to 5, with one abstention, to override the veto, as a boisterous crowd waved signs and clapped loudly from the second-floor balcony. Mr. Miller and Councilman Bill Perkins, the main sponsor of the legislation, gave speeches that brought cheers. The Council also moved to override the mayor's veto of legislation to create a citywide electronic death registry, which is intended to expedite the process of issuing death certificates. Bloomberg administration officials immediately denounced the lead law as misguided and dangerous, saying it would not safeguard the city's children. They have repeatedly warned that the law would be extremely costly to carry out, would pose a hardship for landlords and would waste resources by duplicating programs already in place. ''We think it is a failed bill, a flawed one,'' said Jerilyn Perine, the commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''Perhaps most sadly, we think we missed an opportunity to create a bill that really would have, in a meaningful way, protected the city's children, instead of just a bill that provides for a very good sound bite.'' Health Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden also issued a statement against the legislation. ''New York City has been at the forefront of attempts to prevent lead poisoning for the past 45 years,'' he said. ''This law would be a giant step in the wrong direction in our efforts to eliminate lead poisoning.'' Still, city housing and health officials said yesterday that they were prepared to enforce the new law even though they had problems with it. These officials said the administration had not decided whether to file a lawsuit over the law, but Council officials said they had been told there would not be a legal challenge. Of an estimated 1.8 million city apartments built before 1960, 350,000 units are believed to have at least one occupant under age 7 and could potentially be affected by the law, city officials said. The new law generally requires landlords to remove, or take other steps to correct, a lead paint hazard within 49 days of being cited for a violation by city housing inspectors. Under the previous law, landlords had 60 days to respond. Several developers of low-income housing said yesterday that while they supported some provisions in the new law, they feared it would make it difficult to obtain liability insurance and would discourage investment in redevelopment projects. John McCarthy, executive vice president of the Community Preservation Corporation, which finances low-income housing, said that as many as 1,220 planned apartments could be jeopardized by the law. ''It's going to make it easier to sue landlords,'' he said. ''Which is going to make it harder to funnel investment into old buildings to pay for the extensive renovations that 60-, 80-, 100-year old buildings need.'' Supporters of the bill, however, dismissed those concerns and shouted angrily at opponents outside City Hall just hours before the Council vote. ''It's a cynical attempt to divert the issues and immunize landlords from brain-damaging children,'' said Pete Sikora, of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a government oversight group financed by college students and private foundations. It supports the legislation."
"Sandra Rupert, a counselor at an elementary school in this town tucked high up in the Blue Ridge Mountains, wondered last year about two sisters who were second and third graders. They had headaches, colds and coughs virtually every day. Sheriff Mark Shook found the explanation when he raided the children's home and discovered their mother and her boyfriend were cooking methamphetamine in the attic, next to where the girls slept. The girls were suffering from the toxic fumes emitted by the methamphetamine cooking, said Chad Slagle, a social worker with the Watauga County Child Protective Services Unit. They were removed immediately from the house and taken away from their mother. They had to leave without taking any of their clothes or toys, Mr. Slagle said, for fear of further contamination. The girls are among the young victims as methamphetamine has crossed the Mississippi and moved to the East Coast in the past few years. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, small methamphetamine laboratories, known as mom and pop labs, are now being found in every state in the East. What makes the spread particularly worrisome is new evidence that children living in homes with laboratories face a health threat as hazardous as those who actually use the drug. A study released in January by the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, which specializes in respiratory illnesses, found that poisonous chemicals released in the methamphetamine cooking process spread throughout buildings where the cooking was being done. ''The study showed that the chemicals are everywhere in the house and that children living in houses with meth labs might as well be taking the drug directly,'' said Michele Leonhart, the acting deputy administrator of the D.E.A., which helped finance the research. Last year, 8,000 illegal methamphetamine laboratories were seized nationwide, and 3,300 children were found in them, according to D.E.A. figures. In addition, 48 children were burned or injured and one was killed when methamphetamine laboratories caught on fire or exploded, as they sometimes do, the agency's statistics show. In Tennessee, which has the worst methamphetamine problem in the Southeast, 697 children were removed from their parents' custody and placed in foster homes over the past 18 months because they were living in places with methamphetamine laboratories, said Carla Aaron, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Children's Services. About the same number were placed with relatives who were not cooking methamphetamine, Ms. Aaron said. Here in Boone, a town of 22,000 in western North Carolina near the Tennessee border, 41 illegal methamphetamine laboratories have been seized in the past two years, and 17 children have been placed in foster homes or with other relatives, said Mr. Slagle, the social worker. ''We had heard about meth for years, but it was always a West Coast problem,'' Mr. Slagle said. ''So we were completely surprised when it hit us here.'' It is hard to compare the impact of different drugs. But given the harm methamphetamine does to children and the large amount of toxic waste cooking it creates -- five pounds for every pound of methamphetamine -- some law enforcement officials are now comparing the problem to the crack cocaine epidemic in the nation's big cities in the 1980's. ''Meth makes crack look like child's play, both in terms of what it does to the body and how hard it is to get off,'' said Capt. Richard P. Nuzzo of the New York State Police. Mr. Nuzzo is a member of the New York State Contaminated Crime Scene Emergency Response Team, which deals with methamphetamine. The authorities in New York State found their first methamphetamine laboratory only in 1999, Captain Nuzzo said. By last year the number had climbed to 73, mostly upstate. Methamphetamine is an artificial stimulant that releases high levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine into the brain, producing euphoria and great energy, often lasting up to 12 hours. But it also leads to paranoia, delusions and memory loss, and over a period of time to physical decay like rotting teeth. There is debate among experts about how treatable methamphetamine addiction is. But most specialists believe it is one of the hardest to treat, requiring that a patient stay in treatment for up to two years. Cooking methamphetamine is an extremely toxic process, said Dr. Andrew Mason, a forensic toxicologist who lives in Boone. There are two common methods used in the mom and pop laboratories, and they both produce dangerous gasses and leave hazardous waste, Dr. Mason said. One method combines red phosphorous, usually taken from the strips on matchboxes; pseudoephedrine, from cold tablets; and iodine. The other method, more common in farming country, involves anhydrous ammonia, a liquid fertilizer, cooked with pseudoephedrine and lithium, taken from car batteries. ''One out of every five labs is discovered because of an explosion,'' Dr. Mason said. ''That alone ought to tell you something. If you heat the ingredients too high, they spontaneously burst into flame.'' Last Monday, a laboratory was discovered when it blew up in a house down a hollow in the mountains just outside Boone. The man doing the cooking had third-degree burns, Sheriff Shook said. The red phosphorous method produces phosphine gas, which can be lethal, Dr. Mason said. The ammonia method can produce a cloud of ammonia gas, which is also extremely dangerous, he said. Last year, six members of the volunteer fire department in Deep Gap, a neighboring town, were injured when they put out a fire in a trailer where, unknown to them, there was a methamphetamine laboratory. One of the men, Darien South, 31, had his lungs burned so badly that he went into respiratory arrest for four days. Mr. South said that as a result of his injuries, he had lost his job as a truck driver for Coca-Cola and had so much difficulty breathing that he had trouble performing his other job, as a preacher in a Baptist church. Sheriff Shook said he believed methamphetamine first came into his county via truck drivers from Tennessee, who for a price taught local people how to cook it. The local authorities have improvised their response. Mr. Slagle said that in his first case, he was investigating a family for domestic violence when Sheriff Shook told him the parents had a laboratory he was going to raid. ''We were completely ignorant about the dangers, and when we took the kids, we let them keep their clothes and stuffed animals, contaminating our vehicles and contaminating the children further,'' Mr. Slagle said. By September last year, the county had worked out a rigorous protocol. In a raid, the sheriff's deputies found methamphetamine and its residue all over a house where the father was cooking, so Mr. Slagle made the man's 15- and 16-year-old sons take off their clothes and gave them new clothing. They were then taken to the emergency room in the Boone hospital where a nurse dressed in a ''moon suit'' decontaminated them, scrubbing them down with a special solution and large brushes, ''like a car wash,'' Mr. Slagle said. One problem Sheriff Shook faces is that North Carolina's current penalties for manufacturing methamphetamine are light, the same as for growing one marijuana plant. A first-time offender faces a maximum sentence of six to eight months in jail and can get out on bond for as little as $1,000. ''So they can be back cooking before we finish the paperwork,'' Sheriff Shook said. That was what happened in the case of the two sisters. Their mother and her boyfriend were charged, but were released on bail, and the grandmother, who was given custody of the girls, secretly let them go back to their mother. In January, the methamphetamine laboratory apparently started a fire behind the house. When sheriff's deputies arrived, they found jars with chemical residue from cooking methamphetamine in the kitchen sink along with the family's dishes. The county will now move to terminate the mother's parental rights and put the girls in a foster home, Mr. Slagle said. Ms. Rupert, the school counselor, said, ''The sad thing is that these girls lost everything.'' After they were taken away the first time, people volunteered to give them new toys and clothes. This time, they had to leave those new possessions in the house. They too were contaminated."
"For almost half a century, the hulking factories across a vast nuclear reservation here churned out the plutonium for most of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, including the bomb used on Nagasaki. But in the last several years, with the cold war long over, the shuttered silence of the nine nuclear reactors on this 586-square-mile site has been followed by one of the world's largest cleanups, costing $2 billion a year. An army of workers numbering more than 11,000 faces the staggering cleanup task at the Hanford complex in the high desert of southeastern Washington, a project made more daunting with an accelerated timetable that slashed cleanup projections to 35 years from 70. The quicker pace has led to charges among some doctors, experts and lawmakers that speed has taken priority over worker health and safety. And some warn that, in its dormancy, the vast wasteland may pose even more danger to the cleanup workers than it did to those who built the nation's arsenal here when the complex was in full operation. ''Cleanup is a dangerous job,'' said Dr. Tim K. Takaro, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Washington who treats workers monthly at Hanford. Those at risk, he said, are the large numbers of workers who ''enter the dark corners of these buildings that have not been touched for years.'' The State of Washington has just begun a new investigation into accusations by an advocacy group that the federal Department of Energy and its on-site contractors are ignoring some of the risks associated with the cleanup. The state attorney general, Christine O. Gregoire, started the review after trying, her office said, without success, to get Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to look into the charges. Federal energy officials and the Hanford cleanup contractors say they have made every effort to protect the workers, asserting that the new timetable did not result in hazardous conditions. A spokesman for the Energy Department said the number of cases involving loss of work because of injury has declined every year since 1998. And Jessie H. Roberson, the assistant secretary of energy for environmental management, said the department was approaching the cleanup with more caution than before. ''You can't even compare it to 10 years ago.'' But, she added, ''I don't know if there is more or less risk.'' At the post-nuclear Hanford, the cleanup is tangled in legal battles over workers' health, dangers to the environment and disputes among government agencies about oversight of safety. Hanford's biggest nuclear reactor closed in 1986, and the giant chemical processing complex that handled some of the world's most hazardous materials was mostly shut by 1988. But court battles continue between the federal government, states and environmental groups over how the nuclear waste will be handled and where it will be stored. Along with the reactors, Hanford's 177 underground tanks hold 53 million gallons of radioactive waste, and there are 270 billion gallons of contaminated groundwater near the banks of the Columbia River. For the thousands of workers assigned to the cleanup, the specter of debilitating illness has resurfaced as the cleanup moves forward. Because some former plant workers have become cleanup workers, it is difficult to determine when they were exposed to the toxic substances. Still, experts say some of the cleanup workers are exhibiting illnesses like asbestos-related problems that are different from the obvious radiation illness. Dr. Takaro says he has found that the project brings workers into closer contact with hazardous materials used to make bombs, like beryllium, a metal with various uses that can cause incurable lung disease if particles are inhaled. The allegations under review by the state attorney general's office stem from a report by the Government Accountability Project, a nonprofit group that represents some Hanford workers in legal actions. The report said that from 2002 through the middle of last year, there were 45 incidents in which 67 workers required medical attention because they were exposed to toxic vapors from the underground tanks. ''Hanford is in the process of creating a new generation of sick and injured workers,'' the report said. Tom Peterson, 51, an ironworker rigger who has worked at Hanford for 25 years, is one of 21 workers with chronic beryllium disease, an illness unknown at the height of the cold war. Dr. Takaro said 84 more have been ''sensitized,'' to beryllium, which means they are at high risk of contracting the full-blown disease. ''I went to work out there figuring I was going to support my family,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''I didn't expect to go out there and be poisoned and nobody fess up to anything. If they would have told me ahead of time what I was getting into, maybe I wouldn't have taken the job.'' Electricians, a group not generally thought at high risk, are among those showing symptoms of exposure to asbestos and other hazards, as well as health physics technicians, who help monitor workers' radiation exposure. Last June, 12 workers inhaled radioactive gas and two also tested positive for skin contamination when they were working on the ''tank farms,'' according to a report by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an oversight panel established by Congress. The report said that a health physics technician had ''unsuccessfully tried to stop the work.'' The job, on a moveable pipe used to pump waste between tanks, had been downgraded by contractors from a ''high radiological risk work,'' to a medium one, the report said. Joel A. Eacker, a vice president at CH2M Hill, the contractor on the tank project, said those workers were exposed to a minimal amount of radiation. He called the June incident ''unfortunate,'' and said procedures were changed. Some newly sickened workers have been exposed to metal tools made of beryllium alloys. These are favored at the tank farms because there is a danger of hydrogen in the air, and the beryllium tools do not create sparks, experts say. Some of these workers argued that on-site doctors under contract were reluctant to diagnose illnesses that could be related to their work. A diagnosis of beryllium sensitivity, for example, would be important because workers who have it, or whose blood tests show they have been sensitized, are supposed to be transferred to prevent further exposure. In addition, their chances for compensation depend on the disease being work-related. Mr. Peterson and two other workers with chronic beryllium disease said in interviews that outside doctors issued their diagnoses, years after Hanford site doctors said other lung problems caused their symptoms. Those included primarily fatigue and shortness of breath, and abnormal lung X-rays. The three men refer to themselves as the ''Hanford Hemorrhoids,'' because they have organized with other workers and loudly criticized the Energy Department and its medical contractor, the Hanford Environmental Health Foundation. The foundation has held the contract for treating workers at Hanford for 38 years, but in January lost a competition for renewal; its contract expires in March. Craig Hall, 51, an electrician at Hanford for 23 years, says he was the first to receive the chronic beryllium disease diagnosis. Foundation doctors, he said, told him in 1991 that X-rays showed possibly lung cancer, tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, a fibrotic lung disease. ''If you have an injury or something, I honestly believe they do everything in the world they can to do you under,'' Mr. Hall said. The sick workers have various ailments: persistent cough, night sweats, extreme fatigue, and Mr. Hall, who learned he had the disease in 1996, said he had gout and had been hospitalized because of blockage of his salivary glands caused by the beryllium in his system. In an e-mail message, Lee T. Ashjian, the president and chief executive of the Hanford health foundation, defended the nonprofit medical group's approach. Beryllium screening and case management, Mr. Ashjian said, were ''managed according to the highest standard of care.'' Workers can volunteer for blood tests, he said, and those who test positive are ''assured timely referral for diagnosis and treatment.'' Geoff T. Tyree, a spokesman for Fluor Hanford, one of the major contractors at the site, said that the Energy Department instituted a beryllium disease prevention program in the late 1990's. All contractors must identify places where beryllium may be present and notify employees. Mr. Tyree acknowledged, however, that contractors were still identifying buildings where workers could come into contact with the metal. ''We believe the program is protective of employees,'' he said. ''Certainly there is room for improvement. It's a developing program and a developing health issue.'' Some members of Congress have been urging the department to exert more authority over the site contractors. And the oversight panel set up by Congress does not want to see safety rules relaxed. It has taken issue with a plan by the Energy Department that would allow Hanford contractors and other sites to draw up their own plans for meeting safety rules. John Conway, chairman of the oversight panel, said the panel objected to the agency's plan because it would mean that many rules and requirements would be softened, or considered merely guidance, without enforcement teeth. Ms. Roberson, of the Energy Department, disagreed, saying the agency would still control safety standards. But Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the ranking minority member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, complained in a recent letter to Secretary Abraham that ''there has been very little evidence that D.O.E. contractors have made the interest of their workers a foremost concern.'' Mr. Dingell added, ''In the past, weapons production took priority over health and safety; currently, accelerated cleanup schedules and reduced cleanup budgets are taking priority.'' The contractors are on notice that they must ensure safe working conditions, said Joseph Davis a spokesman for the Energy Department. ''We will not put at any risk any of our workers for the benefit of a faster cleanup,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We can terminate them any time if we think they're doing something really stupid.''"
"The Environmental Protection Agency should be allowed to use data from studies in which humans are intentionally doused with pesticides and other toxic substances, as long as strict scientific and ethical standards are met, a National Academy of Sciences report has concluded. The report, released on Thursday, was requested by the Bush administration in 2001 after environmental advocacy groups revealed in the late 1990's that companies were testing pesticides on humans. Michael R. Taylor, a chairman of the academy's scientific panel, said that if human studies would increase the accuracy of the agency's decisions, they should be conducted, ''but only if we have an assurance that the participants of the study will not be harmed.'' The environmental agency initially imposed a moratorium on human pesticide studies, but it later accepted such studies case by case in making decisions on regulating chemicals. The academy's report lays out criteria for what types of human pesticide studies the environmental agency should be allowed to accept. While initially prompted by pesticides testing, the panel said the recommendations were more broadly directed at all the agency's regulations on toxic substances, including air pollutants and water pollutants. The report recommended that the agency accept only studies grounded in animal research, indicating that the procedures were safe. The agency should also establish an advisory board to review the studies, it said. The report also addressed the delicate issue of paying human subjects, recommending that the payments should neither be so high as to entice subjects unduly or so low that only the poor were willing to participate. It also recommended that the environmental agency study whether additional compensation should be given to human subjects injured in studies. Industry groups, including the one representing pesticide companies, said they were pleased by the panel's findings. Environmental advocacy groups were critical of the report. Correction: February 21, 2004, Saturday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a recommendation that the Environmental Protection Agency be allowed to use data from pesticide tests with humans misstated the way subjects are exposed. They ingest the pesticides -- that is, they are dosed (not doused)."
"Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg continued yesterday to oppose a tough new law on lead-paint hazards, which the City Council passed this week over his veto, saying that he hoped it would be thrown out in the courts. ''This is not the kind of bill we should have,'' Mayor Bloomberg said. ''Now there's a good chance the courts will throw it out because they threw out the last one based on not having an environmental impact statement. This one will probably be thrown out, I hope, for the same reason.'' But Mayor Bloomberg, who was speaking on his weekly radio show on WABC-AM, declined yesterday to say whether the city would file a legal challenge to block the lead law from taking effect within the next six months. Instead, he said the city was prepared to enforce the law because ''that's democracy -- you have to do it whether you agree with it or not.'' The new law regulates the removal of lead-paint hazards, including dust, from apartments built before 1960. It also requires landlords to identify all children younger than 7 living inside those units every year. While council leaders say the law will help protect children from lead poisoning, Bloomberg administration officials, landlords and advocates for low-income housing say it will be extremely costly, duplicate programs already in place and discourage affordable housing projects by making it more difficult to secure liability insurance. Several of these opponents said yesterday that they were considering suing over the law. Councilman Bill Perkins, the main sponsor of the law, said the council had spent months studying the environmental impacts of the new law. In contrast, he said, the environmental review for the previous law on lead paint received all of ''40 seconds.'' In July, the State Court of Appeals struck down the city's four-year-old law to clean up lead paint, saying the Council failed to identify and explain the potential effects on the environment and public health. Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that the new lead law was an effort to ''pander to a handful of activists who will never be satisfied,'' and called for a more practical solution to protecting children from lead poisoning. Indeed, the mayor said that he would like nothing better than to rid the city of lead poisoning, a scourge that he asserted had brought down earlier civilizations. ''If you go back and look at Roman bones, an awful lot of the people had lead poisoning and malaria,'' he said. ''Those were the two things that really, maybe, in the end brought down the Roman Empire.''"
"A federal judge in California ruled yesterday that the chemicals used to execute inmates by lethal injection there and in many other states do not cause undue suffering. One of the three chemicals involved, pancuronium bromide, has been challenged in at least nine cases in the last several months. The decision yesterday was the first in these cases to rule on whether use of the drug was humane. Defense lawyers argue that the chemical may mask the inmate's suffering. It paralyzes the skeletal muscles but does not affect the brain or nerves. A person injected with it is conscious but cannot move or speak. It is possible, defense lawyers say, that an inmate could remain awake as he suffocates. In the decision yesterday, the judge, Jeremy Fogel, of Federal District Court in San Jose, Calif., ruled that the chemical, marketed as Pavulon, had a legitimate purpose in executions. In California and about 30 other states, pancuronium bromide is the second drug in a three-chemical sequence. The first is sodium pentothal, a so-called ultra-short-acting barbiturate. It can be effective for only minutes. In surgery, it is used to induce rather than maintain anesthesia. Doctors like it because patients who have immediate complications awaken quickly enough to be saved. The third is potassium chloride, which stops the heart and causes excruciating pain if the prisoner is conscious. All three chemicals are administered by prison workers who generally have no medical training. Doctors may not take part in executions under most codes of medical ethics. Veterinarians typically use a single lethal dose of a longer-acting barbiturate called sodium pentobarbital in animal euthanasia. Lawyers for the inmate who challenged the chemicals in California, Kevin Cooper, argued that pancuronium bromide ''prevents movement and thus prevents observers from knowing whether the condemned person is experiencing great pain.'' Judge Fogel accepted an unnamed government expert's assessment that the initial injection of sodium pentothal made the possibility that an inmate would remain awake as he suffocated extremely unlikely. There is, he wrote, citing the expert, ''only approximately a 0.00006 percent probability that a condemned inmate given the dose would be conscious, and able to experience pain, after a period of five minutes.'' Lawyers for Mr. Cooper said several states ban veterinary use of pancuronium bromide. ''The lethal injection they intend to use has been banned in the euthanasia of animals,'' said Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. A spokesman for the California attorney general's office, Nathan Barankin, said Judge Fogel's ruling was legally correct. Other courts that have considered recent challenges to the use of the chemical focused on a technical question about the procedural form in which the challenge must be brought. The Supreme Court will soon rule on the procedural point. Deborah W. Denno, a law professor at Fordham University who published a study of the chemicals in lethal injections in 2002, said Judge Fogel's ruling was open to question. ''The drug seems to have no other purpose than to keep a person still,'' Professor Denno said. Mr. Cooper is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday. He was convicted in 1985 of murdering a married couple, their 10-year-old daughter and their daughter's 11-year-old friend. On Jan. 30, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declined to grant clemency."
"The trucks roll in way before sunrise, when few lights are on and almost no one is awake. But people around here, even those who cannot hear the trucks grinding past with their toxic cargo, say they are always aware of where the convoy is going. The trucks come here, as they have for decades, to dump the stuff almost no one wants in this place that almost no one seems to care about. There are 20, 30, sometimes 40 loads a day, enough to build a mound 110 feet tall right in the middle of what old-timers remember was an orchard of sweet Niagara County peaches. Now, where those trees once quivered in breezes from Lake Ontario, the 710-acre Chemical Waste Management landfill towers above every building for miles. People here do not like to say so but they have the distinction of having the only hazardous waste landfill left in the Northeastern United States, a sprawling toxic stockyard of acids, chemicals and other hazards, including the desk Tom Brokaw was using when his office was contaminated with anthrax. For a long time, residents have hoped that state environmental officials would recognize how unfair it is to keep asking them to be the toxic dumping ground for the whole region. They have waited 16 years for the New York Department of Environmental Conservation to comply with a legislative order to spread the burden throughout the state. Finally, last November, a draft report was released, and they were disappointed again. The 50-page draft left locals feeling certain the state wants them to keep the dump and the toxic trucks for some time to come. Not only that, but there could be more -- lots more -- on the way. ''I guess what they're telling us is 'You have it, nobody else wants it, so you're going to have to keep it,''' said Merton K. Wiepert, supervisor of the town of Porter, where Model City and part of the landfill are situated. ''And that's not fair.'' Environmental experts say that the state's inactivity was prompted not by cold feet but by the cold reality of handling hazardous wastes today. More than a decade of consolidation has left just a handful of commercial hazardous waste landfills in the country, which, they say, is not necessarily a bad thing. Those that remain are big, well financed and easier for regulators to watch. But after Love Canal -- 10 miles south of here -- focused attention on the danger of chemical dumping in the early 1980's, it has become nearly impossible to find a community willing to accept even a well-designed and environmentally sound landfill. That often leaves expanding existing landfills the easiest option. ''New York is thrilled not to have to look for another site,'' said Michael B. Gerrard, an environmental lawyer in New York. ''I'm not a bit surprised that the department hasn't come up with an alternative.'' Federal officials say the Model City landfill is generally well run, and they consider the thick layer of clay beneath it to be well suited for containing toxic waste over the long haul. State officials also welcome the landfill, which accepts waste from more than 2,000 manufacturers through the Northeast and eases the way for New York to export some of its wastes to other states. Michael Fraser, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, defended the new draft plan, saying it was never intended to select alternative sites. ''The task at D.E.C.,'' Mr. Fraser said, ''was to prepare a siting plan to establish a framework to guide the state agencies,'' which would have to approve new landfills. He declined to make further comment. For some of the 25,000 people who live in this flatland of family farms and gracious homes near the Niagara River, the plan is proof the state has written them off. ''People here are so defeated,'' said Amy Witryol, a retired bank executive in nearby Lewiston. ''No matter what we do, it seems the government is not going to try to help us.'' The federal government itself bequeathed a legacy even more menacing. A few hundred yards from the landfill, and about half a mile from the 2,500-student campus of the Lewiston-Porter Central School District, lie tons of radioactive material left over from the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort that created the first atomic bomb. It is here because early in the war, the Army took control of 7,567 acres of orchards in Porter and Lewiston to build a huge TNT factory, officially known as the Lake Ontario Ordnance Works. Years earlier, in 1893, an entrepreneur, William T. Love, planned an ideal community powered by water brought by canal from Niagara Falls. Before his plan collapsed, Mr. Love built a section of his canal in the city of Niagara Falls, which later become surrounded by the chemical plants that created the poisonous cesspool known as Love Canal. On the other end of the uncompleted canal, Mr. Love built a score of houses and stores at a crossroads he called Model City. ''And now,'' said D. James Langlois, a Lewiston councilman, ''it's become a model of how things shouldn't be done.'' ''The TNT'' as it was known to local residents, turned out more explosives than the Army needed and was shut down after nine months. The Army then used the vast property to store radioactive waste left over from the Manhattan Project in nearby Tonawanada. Some was stored in a concrete water tower. The rest was simply spilled onto the ground. After the war, more than half the 7,567 acres was sold to private owners. Radioactive waste continued to be dumped on land still in government hands and in 1966, hundreds of these acres were sold to various businesses. Years later, a commercial landfill was opened. In the 1980's, the water tower holding radioactive residue was demolished. Its contents were transferred to the basement of a nearby war-era building and covered with five and a half feet of clay and topsoil. Ann Roberts, a chemist whose four children attended the Lewiston-Porter schools, has spent the last three years trying to piece together the extent of the contamination. She found records showing large areas outside the current government storage site had once contained radioactive material. ''To my mind, if you have a site that is contaminated with radioactive wastes, you do as little as possible to disturb it,'' Ms. Roberts said. But, she said, the contaminated land used by CWM had places where ''they are continually digging up soil and bringing in more wastes.'' A few residents live within a mile of the 191-acre nuclear dump, officially called the Niagara Falls Storage Site. It contains 25,000 cubic yards of radioactive residue -- including radium, thorium and uranium -- and an additional 235,000 cubic yards of less-radioactive material. The Army Corps of Engineers now oversees its cleanup. Abutting the nuclear burial ground is the CWM landfill, one of the largest in the country, which has the capacity to receive as much as 425,000 tons of hazardous waste a year from 30 states and Puerto Rico. The draft plan estimates that the CWM landfill will top out next year, but despite that says it is ''not practical or relevant'' to recommend an alternative site. But executives at CWM, a subsidiary of Waste Management, a $12 billion national company, said they expected to use the current landfill for six more years, especially if they were permitted to add 10 feet to the height of the mound. They have applied for permits for other landfills on the same property. ''We'd like to continue to operate the facility for another 40 years, or more,'' said Richard D. Sturges, CWM's district manager. Mr. Sturges said CWM had invested $50 million in the Model City operation since buying it in 1984. Two state monitors are supposed to be on site every day to make sure it operates safely. Although the landfill pays from $1 million to $3 million a year in gross receipts taxes to local towns, many residents said they would gladly pay higher property taxes if it were closed. CWM officials say residents have it all wrong. ''We ought to be applauded for what we do out there, but instead we're always being spit on,'' said George H. Spira, a former general manager of the landfill. Mr. Spira, who also is chairman of the planning board of Porter, in 2001 abstained from voting on a zoning change allowing CWM to expand. The rezoning passed but is being challenged in court.William Choboy, a Porter councilman who until last month was president of Residents for Responsible Government, which opposes the landfill, said it was difficult to fight a company with powerful political connections like CWM. Dennis C. Vacco, a former New York attorney general, was a regional vice president for CWM's parent, Waste Management, until last September, when he joined an Albany lobbying firm that represents the company. Mr. Choboy worries that toxic dumping over the last 60 years has made this an unhealthy place to live. He hands out copies of State Department of Health surveys showing elevated levels of thyroid cancer among women, and higher-than-expected levels of bladder, prostate and colorectal cancer among men. But state health officials have never directly linked those cancer rates to the landfill or the radioactive wastes. The question of providing environmental justice by dispersing hazardous waste landfills throughout the state was first raised by the Legislature in 1987. The town of Porter considered the first draft plan inadequate and challenged it in court. A state Supreme Court judge ordered it redone ''with all deliberate speed.'' That was in 1994. Legislators have greeted this latest draft coolly. State Senator George D. Maziarz, a Republican of North Tonawanda, said he expected the Legislature to reject the plan because it did not offer alternative sites or address upcoming projects like dredging PCB-contaminated mud from the Hudson River. That project -- one of the largest industrial cleanups in history -- would generate 2.65 million cubic yards of mud. Model City is one of the few places in the Northeast where it could be dumped. Walter E. Mugdan, regional director of the division of environmental planning and protection in the federal Environmental Protection Agency, said no decision had yet been made. It is possible, he said, that the mud could be shipped out of state. But others, like Susan L. Senecah, an associate professor of environmental decision-making who works with Senator Maziarz, are certain that this latest mess is headed for the former peach orchards of Model City. ''This is not environmental justice,'' she said. ''It's perpetual injustice.'' Correction: March 11, 2004, Thursday A picture yesterday with the continuation of an article in The Metro Section about the Chemical Waste Management landfill in Model City, N.Y., was published in error. It was a duplicate of the one on the section's front showing a worker in a hazardous materials suit, not a view from the top of the landfill."
"Two decades after Love Canal became the first polluted site on the newly created Superfund list, federal officials announced yesterday that the neighborhood that epitomized environmental horror in the late 1970's was clean enough to be taken off the list. Hundreds of families were evacuated from the working-class Love Canal section of Niagara Falls, N.Y., after deadly chemicals started oozing through the ground into basements and a school, burning children and pets and, according to experts, causing birth defects and miscarriages. The neighborhood had been built on a 19th-century canal where a toxic mix of more than 80 industrial chemicals had been buried. The removal of Love Canal from the Superfund list will be mostly symbolic. The cleanup at the toxic waste site, the nation's most notorious, took 21 years and cost close to $400 million, but most of the work was completed a few years ago. Still, the proposal by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to take the area off the list of the worst environmental disasters represented a significant milestone for the agency, which was in its infancy when the cleanup began. And for E.P.A. officials, who have been criticized for their handling of the World Trade Center cleanup and have had to battle for funds to maintain programs that have run into opposition from Republicans and corporate interests, the formal end to the Love Canal cleanup was welcome news. ''This is a historic time,'' said Jane M. Kenny, the federal agency's regional administrator, who said that she called the site's supervisors yesterday morning to congratulate them. ''The good news here that needs to be told is that we now have a vibrant area that's been revitalized, people living in a place where they feel happy, and it's once again a nice neighborhood.'' Industrial chemicals dumped into the partly completed canal by the Hooker Chemical Company from 1947 to 1952 have been removed or contained in one area that was lined with impermeable materials and capped by clay. A drainage system collects water runoff and treats it. About 260 homes north of the canal have been renovated and sold to new owners, and about 150 acres east of the canal have been sold to commercial developers for light industrial uses. Ms. Kenny said that even when Love Canal is removed from the cleanup list, the agency would not walk away from the neighborhood or the tons of toxic material that still lie buried in a fenced-off area there. ''There comes a time when you say that now, yeah, the work is done,'' she said, ''but we're going to continue to monitor what goes on there.'' But for some of those whose lives have been shaped by the long, unpleasant history of Love Canal, the government's decision seems more like political opportunism than good science. ''Nothing is different from what it was five years ago except that the E.P.A. needs to look good,'' said Lois Marie Gibbs, a former resident of Love Canal who originally organized her neighbors to demand a cleanup. She is now executive director of the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, an organization that works with communities facing environmental problems. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has criticized the federal environmental agency for the way it reacted to concerns about air pollution at the trade center site, said that she welcomed the announcement that parts of the neighborhood had been restored but that declaring victory was premature. ''While Love Canal marked the beginning of the Superfund, its successful cleanup should, by no means, mark its demise,'' she said in a statement. ''We still have a long way to go.'' The federal agency will take public comments for 30 days on its proposal to remove Love Canal and two other sites in western New York from the list, but there is little doubt they will be removed. The tremendous size and awful scope of the problem at Love Canal led President Jimmy Carter to declare environmental emergencies in 1978 and 1980. The image of toxic wastes bubbling up from the ground shocked people across the country, and in 1980 directly spurred Congress to pass the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which came to be known as Superfund. The law provided for the establishment of a priority list of dirty sites, and created a mechanism for the cleanups to be paid for by the companies that created them. A ''polluter pays'' tax was also set up to pay for cleanups at abandoned hazardous waste sites. That tax expired in 1995, and Democrats in the Senate have tried to reinstate it. The most recent effort was last week, when the bill, opposed by the Bush administration, was defeated, 53-43. Since the Superfund was started in 1983, 300 sites have been delisted, said Ms. Kenny of the E.P.A., and work is progressing on many others. ''When you think about the fact that there are 1,200 sites on the current national priorities list, and work is going on at a majority of sites, with 900 substantially completed, that shows real progress,'' she said. The E.P.A. also plans to remove two other sites in western New York from the Superfund list: the 22-acre former landfill on 102nd Street in Niagara Falls owned by the Occidental Chemical Corporation and the Olin Chemical Corporation, and a 65-acre former county dump in Wheatfield, just north of the Niagara River. Work on Love Canal was overseen by the federal agency, while New York State established the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency, which refurbished some of the homes and sold them to new owners willing to move back into the area north of Love Canal, now renamed Black Creek Village. When that agency formally went out of business in August, the neighborhood held a street party. Craig Rice, 49, grew up in the Love Canal neighborhood and watched his father die there from a rare brain cancer. He lives near the site of one of the schools that had to be demolished because chemicals were seeping into the buildings, giving off hazardous fumes. He questioned whether it was a good idea to keep so many chemicals buried on 70 acres in the neighborhood, even if they are capped by a thick layer of clay and surrounded by an eight-foot fence. But he said he felt secure knowing that monitors would pick up any problems. ''I definitely feel like it's under control,'' Mr. Craig said. Five years ago, Eric Bluff, 31, bought one of the houses near Love Canal that had been restored. He was well aware of area's toxic history, having grown up just a few blocks away. He remembers how desolated it looked after 950 families had to be evacuated from a 10-block area surrounding the canal. ''I remember going through here with my parents and all the houses being vacant -- it looked like a ghost town,'' Mr. Bluff said as he was blowing the snow from the sidewalk outside his ranch house. He and his wife, Christina, were happy to hear that the government considers the area to be clean. ''It's a real nice neighborhood,'' he said. ''I have no worries.''"
"Michael Leavitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, will announce today new standards aimed at reducing smog in the country's most polluted urban areas as well as its national parks. These are important steps in the battle for cleaner air and impose heavy obligations on an administrator who is relatively new to the job. But they cannot distract him from the equally important obligation to strengthen the administration's timid and legally suspect proposals for regulating mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The mercury issue will not go away. In recent days, 45 senators and 10 attorneys general have urged Mr. Leavitt to write new and stronger rules. Senators James Jeffords of Vermont and Hillary Clinton of New York have demanded an investigation into the role industry played in drafting the existing proposals, as well as into allegations that the White House manipulated a National Academy of Sciences study in order to minimize mercury's health risks. Mr. Leavitt can be forgiven for feeling put upon. The proposals were developed before he took the job and, as he is fond of pointing out, the Clinton administration largely ducked the issue. That does not make the administration's proposals any better. The White House boasts that its plans would achieve a 30 percent reduction in mercury emissions by power plants by 2010 and a 70 percent reduction by 2018, largely through a system that would let companies choose between reducing their own emissions or buying credits from other companies. In mercury's case, that's probably illegal, and it is certainly inappropriate. The Clean Air Act rightly requires state-of-the-art pollution controls at each individual plant for toxic substances like mercury, in part to prevent ''hot spots'' from developing near the plants. There is no evidence that this approach would be prohibitively expensive, as industry claims. On the contrary, it would force the development of cost-effective technologies, and it would certainly be better for Americans' health. Mr. Leavitt should be heading in this direction."
"If you want a single example that captures why so many people no longer believe in the good intentions of the Bush administration, look at the case of mercury pollution. Mercury can damage the nervous system, especially in fetuses and infants -- which is why the Food and Drug Administration warns pregnant women and nursing mothers against consuming types of fish, like albacore tuna, that often contain high mercury levels. About 8 percent of American women have more mercury in their bloodstreams than the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. During the 1990's, government regulation greatly reduced mercury emissions from medical and municipal waste incineration, leaving power plants as the main problem. In 2000, the E.P.A. determined that mercury is a hazardous substance as defined by the Clean Air Act, which requires that such substances be strictly controlled. E.P.A. staff estimated that enforcing this requirement would lead to a 90 percent reduction in power-plant mercury emissions by 2008. A few months ago, however, the Bush administration reversed this determination and proposed a ''cap and trade'' system for mercury that it claimed would lead to a 70 percent reduction by 2018. Other estimates suggest that the reduction would be smaller, and take longer. For some pollutants, setting a cap on total emissions, while letting polluters buy and sell emission rights, is a cost-efficient way to reduce pollution. The cap-and-trade system for sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, has been a big success. But the science clearly shows that cap-and-trade is inappropriate for mercury. Sulfur dioxide is light, and travels long distances: power plants in the Midwest can cause acid rain in Maine. So a cap on total national emissions makes sense. Mercury is heavy: much of it precipitates to the ground near the source. As a result, coal-fired power plants in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan create ''hot spots'' -- chemical Chernobyls -- where the risks of mercury poisoning are severe. Under a cap-and-trade system, these plants are likely to purchase pollution rights rather than cut emissions. In other words, the administration proposal would perpetuate mercury pollution where it does the most harm. That probably means thousands of children born with preventable neurological problems. So how did the original plan get replaced with a plan so obviously wrong on the science? The answer is that the foxes have been put in charge of the henhouse. The head of the E.P.A.'s Office of Air and Radiation, like most key environmental appointees in the Bush administration, previously made his living representing polluting industries (which, in case you haven't guessed, are huge Republican donors). On mercury, the administration didn't just take industry views into account, it literally let the polluters write the regulations: much of the language of the administration's proposal came directly from lobbyists' memos. E.P.A. experts normally study regulations before they are issued, but they were bypassed. According to The Los Angeles Times: ''E.P.A. staffers say they were told not to undertake the normal scientific and economic studies called for under a standing executive order. . . . E.P.A. veterans say they cannot recall another instance where the agency's technical experts were cut out of developing a major regulatory proposal.'' Mercury is just a particularly vivid example of what's going on in environmental protection, and public policy in general. As a devastating article in Sunday's New York Times Magazine documented, the administration's rollback of the Clean Air Act has gone beyond the polluters' wildest dreams. And the corruption of the policy process -- in which political appointees come in with a predetermined agenda, and technical experts who might present information their superiors don't want to hear are muzzled -- has infected every area I know anything about, from tax cuts to matters of war and peace. A Yawngate update: CNN called me to insist that despite what it first said, the administration really, truly wasn't responsible for the network's claim that David Letterman's embarrassing video of a Bush speech was a fake. I still don't understand why the network didn't deny White House involvement until it retracted the charge. But the main point of Friday's column was to highlight the way CNN facilitated crude administration smears of Richard Clarke. Op-Ed Columnist E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com"
"A group representing waterfront neighborhoods outside Manhattan urged officials yesterday to rebuild city transfer stations that ship waste by water. It wants the city to then close some of the stations that it says overburden these communities. Members of the group, the Organization of Waterfront Neighborhoods, have complained that after the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island closed, their neighborhoods were overrun by waste-processing operations and the trucks that bring the trash in and haul it out for disposal. Of the more than 50 transfer stations operating in the city, only one is in Manhattan, according to the organization, a coalition of neighborhood groups. To alleviate the truck traffic, the Bloomberg administration planned to rebuild eight marine transfer stations throughout the city and to build a ninth on Staten Island so that processed trash could be loaded onto barges instead of being trucked through city streets. But that plan turned out to be more expensive and time-consuming than originally thought, so the administration, while not abandoning that plan, is seeking new short- and long-term solutions. As a result, the waterfront group has intensified its efforts to hold the city to the original plan. ''There is infrastructure that can provide immediate environmental relief if we were to switch to a water-based system of transport,'' said Eddie Bautista, an advocate from New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, who helped organize yesterday's news conference near the shuttered marine transfer station at East 91st Street on the Manhattan waterfront. But Speaker Gifford Miller of the City Council, who is a probable candidate for mayor, opposes reopening that station, which is in his own district, as well as one in Harlem, because they are in residential neighborhoods, he said. ''We should be having them not in densely populated residential areas, but in commercial and manufacturing areas that are zoned for them,'' he told reporters. The other marine transfer stations are also in residential neighborhoods or close to them, advocates said, but in areas that are far less wealthy than Mr. Miller's district. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was noncommittal about what the city would do, but took the opportunity to throw a sharp elbow toward his potential rival. ''Some transfer stations will work, some transfer stations won't,'' he said, adding that neighborhoods and boroughs would have to be ''somewhat responsible'' for their own solid waste. ''I know nobody wants to be inconvenienced, and it's easy to pander to groups and say, 'Well, I'm going to have somebody else, some other part of the city, somebody that doesn't vote for me and my constituents, I'm going to have them bear all the pain so you don't,''' he said. ''That's not the real world. It's also not fair.''"
"While working with Environmental Protection Agency officials to write regulations for coal-fired power plants over several recent months, White House staff members played down the toxic effects of mercury, hundreds of pages of documents and e-mail messages show. The staff members deleted or modified information on mercury that employees of the environmental agency say was drawn largely from a 2000 report by the National Academy of Sciences that Congress had commissioned to settle the scientific debate about the risks of mercury. In interviews, 6 of 10 members of the academy's panel on mercury said the changes did not introduce inaccuracies. They said that many of the revisions sharpened the scientific points being made and that justification could be made for or against other changes. Most changes were made by the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which employs economists and scientists to review regulations. But scientists on the academy panel and others outside it as well as environmentalists and politicians expressed concern in recent interviews that a host of subtle changes by White House staff members resulted in proposed rules that played down the health risks associated with mercury from coal-fired power plants. The proposal largely tracks suggestions from the energy industry. While the panel members said the changes did not introduce outright errors, they said they were concerned because the White House almost uniformly minimized the health risks in instances where there could be disagreement. ''What they are saying is not scientifically invalid on its face,'' said Alan Stern, a New Jersey toxicologist who served on the panel. ''Partially they edited for clarity and relevance from a scientific standpoint. But there appears to be an emphasis on wordsmithing that is not necessarily dictated by the science.'' Last Thursday attorneys general from 10 states and 45 senators asked the E.P.A. to scrap the proposed rules, saying they were not strict enough. They also asked Michael O. Leavitt, the agency's administrator, to extend the comment period for the rules, which now ends April 30. Under a court-ordered agreement, the rules are to be in final form by Dec. 15. In some cases, White House staff members suggested phrasing that minimized the links between power plants and elevated levels of mercury in fish, the primary source from which Americans accumulate mercury in their bodies, in a form known as methylmercury. The academy has found that exposure to elevated levels of mercury can damage the brains of children and fetuses. In another instance, a draft passage originally read, ''Recent published studies have shown an association between methylmercury exposure and an increased risk of heart attacks and coronary disease in adult men.'' It was changed to ''it has been hypothesized that there is an association between methylmercury exposure and an increased risk of coronary disease; however this warrants further study as the new studies currently available present conflicting results.'' The change understates known science, some academy panel members said in interviews. The proposed regulations are available on the E.P.A. Web site (epa.gov/). The proposed rules would limit mercury emissions by an estimated 70 percent over decades and would also allow power plants to buy and sell among themselves the rights to create mercury pollution. Mr. Leavitt is reconsidering elements of the rules. Small amounts of mercury occur naturally in the environment. In December 2000, however, the environmental agency concluded that mercury from power plants should be classified as a hazardous air pollutant to be strictly regulated under the Clean Air Act. In December 2003, the Bush administration reversed that finding. The proposed regulations for power plants -- the single-largest source of mercury emissions in the United States -- are the culmination of 14 years of lawsuits, scientific review and government reports. Coal and utility groups lobbied intensively to help shape the regulations, which will cost billions of dollars. Paragraphs in the proposed rules are inserted nearly verbatim from memorandums from the firm of Latham & Watkins, where two top political officials in the E.P.A.'s office overseeing air regulations, Bill Wehrum and Jeffrey Holmstead, once worked. White House officials and E.P.A. political appointees say the changes in the draft rules reflect the typical back and forth of developing regulations among agencies, and environmental agency officials had the option of rejecting the suggestions, which in some cases they did. ''This is a standard collaborative process that involved experts across the government to create a solid product,'' said Dana Perino, the spokeswoman from the Council on Environmental Quality, which coordinates federal environmental efforts. But some critics are not convinced. ''This is a pattern of undermining and disregarding science on political considerations,'' said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, citing a recent letter by the Union of Concerned Scientists, signed by 60 scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, which criticized the administration's handling of science issues. Others feel the White House's Office of Management and Budget is overstepping its bounds. ''O.M.B.'s role is supposed to be to review the economics of rules -- which they did very poorly here -- not to fly speck the science and minimize health threats,'' said Lisa Heinzerling, a professor at Georgetown University who is a co-author of the book ''Priceless,'' on cost-benefit analysis. Throughout an E.P.A. draft of the proposed regulations circulated in November, a White House staff member crossed out the word ''confirmed'' from the phrase describing mercury as a ''confirmed public health risk.'' In some instances, sentences in the final proposals were changed to mercury ''warrants regulation.'' Mr. Wehrum, the chief counsel of E.P.A.'s air regulation office, said that the handwritten changes were prompted by his agency's desire to use more precise legal language from the Clean Air Act. Some members of the National Academy said that sections of the regulations on health effects could have been made more clear, but that the science was strong enough not to delete them entirely. An official with the Office of Management and Budget who emphasized that neurologic risks to children were the most important concern, said language on other health effects was deleted or softened for a number of reasons. In some cases the draft had overstated the known science, while in others, like cerebral palsy, the effects were not relevant to mercury exposure in fish or power plants. Even taking into account studies that have been published since their report in 2000, some panel members said the language was made too soft in several cases. ''There is increasing evidence of an association between mercury exposure and cardiovascular effects,'' said Thomas Burke, an epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins University and a member of the panel. ''I would call it stronger than a hypothesis.'' In another case, a toxicologist with the Office of Management and Budget recommended changes to a sentence saying children exposed to mercury in the womb ''are at increased risk of poor performance on neurobehavioral tests.'' The final sentence that was published said children ''may be at increased risk.'' That pattern was repeated a number of times throughout regulations where ''are'' or ''can'' was changed to ''may.'' The official said that the softened language reflected the fact that low levels of mercury exposure below the safe dose were not known to be risky, even to children. Other scientists interpret the edit differently. Joseph L. Jacobson, a professor of psychology at Wayne State University, who served on the academy panel, said, '' 'May be' suggests an effort to discount the fact that we have consistent evidence across more than one study.'' While it is standard for the White House to review federal agency testimony and reports, E.P.A. staff members say the Bush administration also minimized the amount of mercury that comes from power plants. Over agency staff objections, the White House on several occasions in the past year added the statement that coal burning produces ''roughly one percent of mercury in the global pool.'' According to the E.P.A. staff, the 1 percent figure was added to an agency report on children's health; Senate testimony by Christie Whitman, who was the E.P.A. administrator; and Senate testimony of Mr. Holmstead, who is the assistant agency administrator for air. While that figure is cited in the E.P.A.'s 1997 report to Congress, agency staff members and independent scientists say it is misleading because much of the mercury that ends up in the nation's water and soil comes from nearby sources."
"Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to ship the bulk of the city's residential garbage by barge rather than by truck was met with praise yesterday from several environmentalists and elected officials, but some questioned whether it was the cheapest and most efficient approach to handling the city's waste. The mayor detailed a 20-year plan, under which the city would renovate four marine transfer stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens by the end of 2007 at an estimated cost of $340 million. The city would use these marine transfer stations and private rail transfer stations elsewhere in the city to put each borough's trash into containers before it is shipped to landfills or incinerators outside the state. By depending on barges and rail, the city would phase out a truck-based system in which most of the 50,000 tons of commercial and residential trash generated daily is driven out of state to dumps and incinerators. ''For environmental and economic reasons, this system is ultimately unsustainable,'' Mr. Bloomberg said during a news conference at City Hall to announce the plan. ''It puts serious strains on the quality of life in neighborhoods where transfer stations are located. And as nearby landfills reach their capacity, the city must send its solid waste to ever more distant locations at ever greater costs.'' James T.B. Tripp, general counsel of Environmental Defense, an environmental advocacy group, described the plan as a huge step forward for the city. ''It provides the potential for phasing out old, polluting waste-transfer facilities that are concentrated now in low-income communities,'' he said. But Councilman Michael E. McMahon of Staten Island, who is chairman of the council's solid waste committee, raised questions about the plan's cost predictions. ''Under this plan, the city is getting four marine transfer stations for the price of eight,'' he said, pointing out that in July 2002, the mayor predicted that the renovation of eight waste transfer stations, as he originally proposed, would take about $240 million and two years to complete. ''Now we are looking at an estimate of around $340 million for the city to open only four stations. We need to take a close look at the overall cost of this plan.'' Kate Ascher, executive vice president for infrastructure at the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that the city had lower cost estimates a year ago because it had not finished analyzing what renovating the marine transfer sites would require. She also said that the exact details on where the trash would go once it is placed on barges were still not available because the city was only beginning negotiations with the companies that would move the trash once it is shipped out by water. Under the plan, the city would not reopen a marine transfer station in Harlem, but it would reopen a transfer station on 91st Street on the Upper East Side. Most of Manhattan's trash would be trucked to an incinerator in Newark. The rest of Manhattan's trash would go to the Upper East Side marine transfer station. Peter Madonia, Mayor Bloomberg's chief of staff, cited financial and logistical reasons for choosing to reopen the Upper East Side transfer station and not the one in Harlem. The incinerator in Newark has enough capacity to handle only about 1,500 tons of trash daily from Manhattan, which produces about 2,300 tons daily, he said, and trucks hauling trash to Newark travel a shorter distance from Harlem than from the Upper East Side. But the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, who represents the Upper East Side, criticized the city's decision. ''The plan simply makes no geographic sense,'' he said. ''The city can't possibly claim that the 91st Street decision was based on having trucks travel the shortest distance.'' The speaker pointed to the fact that under the current plan, trash from Washington Heights would go to Newark, while trash from Midtown would go to 91st Street. ''Do you think those are the shortest routes?'' He also said that the operator of the plant in Newark told the City Council last year that he wanted to expand it if the city could guarantee to provide more trash. The mayor's plan also drew a skeptical reaction in Newark. ''It's wrong for the incinerator to make a long-term commitment to take on another state's waste,'' said Arnold Cohen, a member of the Ironbound Committee Against Toxic Waste, an environmental advocacy group in the Ironbound, a neighborhood next to the incinerator. ''Even the best of incinerators releases lead, mercury and other pollutants into the environment, and this plan would push things in the absolute wrong direction for communities that are already overburdened with toxins.''"
"The chairman of the State Assembly Education Committee charged yesterday that New York State health and education officials failed to follow up on reports that dangerous levels of lead had been detected in drinking water at 120 schools and day care facilities. State officials disputed the charge and said that problems had been corrected at all but eight of the schools. The chairman, Assemblyman Steven Sanders, said that regulators distributed a survey in April to 684 schools and day care centers, and that results tallied in August found that the lead levels in water from fountains and sinks at 120 locations were high enough to require action under federal Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. In a blistering attack on the state's Health and Education Departments, Mr. Sanders charged that the agencies ''ignored the findings entirely and did absolutely nothing to follow up.'' He also criticized the agencies for asking schools and day care centers only whether their lead levels exceeded the federal standard of 20 parts per billion and not demanding the specific results. Mr. Sanders also complained that 91 schools had checked a box on the survey saying they needed assistance on lead in drinking water but had received no response. He said he would pursue legislation mandating periodic lead testing at all schools. State officials said that Mr. Sanders was being unnecessarily alarmist and that parents had little reason for concern. ''All but a handful of the schools identified as having levels that exceeded the standard have taken corrective action,'' said William Van Slyke, a spokesman for the Health Department. ''This has actually been a wonderfully successful effort by the two state agencies.'' Mr. Van Slyke accused Mr. Sanders of grandstanding ahead of Election Day. ''This is an egregious example of election eve hysteria,'' he said. Repeated exposure to hazardous lead levels can result in lead poisoning, which can cause irreversible neurological damage, including learning disabilities, hearing loss and other problems. Mr. Sanders, a Democrat from Manhattan, called the agencies ''shamefully negligent'' for failing to follow up on the survey and request detailed information from schools. State officials said the survey was distributed only to schools in areas where questions had been raised about the public water system and where officials would have been monitoring the situation. And they noted that the survey asked schools: ''What follow-up actions have been taken as a result of the sampling?'' Officials said that even before the survey was distributed to 1,700 schools in April, the state had worked with federal officials to check the water in the largest school districts, including New York City, where 33,857 samples were taken from the city's roughly 1,200 schools. In a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency, Michael E. Burke, the director of the Bureau of Public Water Supply Protection, part of the state's Health Department, reported that ''in New York City, mitigative measures were taken at outlets in 370 schools.'' In Syracuse, Mr. Burke reported, 2,351 samples were taken from 370 schools, and problems were addressed at 289 outlets. More than 400 of the state's 5,000 schools operate and maintain their own drinking water supply and are required to test for lead."
"The Federal Aviation Administration's campaign to keep hazardous materials off airplanes, begun after an improper shipment caused a crash in the Florida Everglades that killed 110 people eight years ago, has generated thousands of enforcement cases and tens of millions of dollars in civil penalties. But the punishment is sometimes too little, too late, the inspector general of the Transportation Department said Friday in a report that called for major improvements. Among other problems, the aviation agency takes more than a year to complete enforcement actions in the average case, and drops a large number of cases because it cannot complete its work within two years, a deadline the agency imposed on itself, according to the report. In the F.A.A.'s southern region, the agency dropped a quarter of the cases for that reason, according to the auditors. The average time to complete an enforcement case in the southern region was more than two years, they said. The report said that although penalties had been collected, they had ''little, if any, deterrent value against the violators' noncompliance'' because they were often ''assessed too long after the incident and in reduced amounts no longer commensurate with the severity of the infraction.'' For every dollar in penalties that the agency proposes, it takes in 41 cents, the report found. The agency, in a written response to the report, said it accepted most of the recommendations. It said its collections were only 41 percent of the amount initially proposed because its lawyers sometimes set the dollar amount before they knew how strong the case was. And by law, the agency said, it must adjust the proposed penalty based on the violator's ability to pay. A spokeswoman for the F.A.A., Diane Spitaliere, said the report acknowledged that ''the program is a lot stronger than it was several years ago.'' The agency is making improvements, Ms. Spitaliere said. According to the report, some cases may not be prosecuted because there are too few lawyers to do the work. The ratio of inspectors to lawyers has increased 41 percent in the last six years, the report said. In one region, a single lawyer was handling 166 cases. ''Driven by the lack of resources to effectively manage the case workload and the questionable effectiveness of the penalty process, the Office of Hazardous Materials and the Office of the Chief Counsel must develop acceptable alternate ways of doing business,'' said the report, which was signed by Alexis M. Stefani, the principal assistant inspector general for auditing and evaluation. The aviation agency stepped up its enforcement of hazardous cargo rules after the crash of a ValuJet plane in Florida in May 1996 that was carrying spare parts from another airplane, including oxygen generators that generate emergency oxygen for passengers if cabin pressure is lost. The generators activated, producing heat and releasing oxygen that created a fatal fire. Since that time, the airlines have added fire detection and fire suppression systems to more cargo holds, but stepped-up enforcement has revealed that materials that can start fires or leak toxic substances are commonly shipped by air. The report said government oversight of hazardous materials shipments was ''in flux.'' For example, the dangerous-goods program was suspended after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, so the inspectors could work on security instead. Later, when various F.A.A. security jobs were transferred to the new Transportation Security Administration, the cargo security function went along, but then was transferred back to the aviation agency. One source of hazardous materials is passengers. The report said the Transportation Security Administration, which searches checked and carry-on baggage, seized 8,300 pounds of materials like fireworks, road flares, tear gas and flammable aerosols in the last six weeks of 2003. But the security agency has no way of tracking passengers who take such materials onto aircraft, even if they are repeat offenders, or putting them ''on notice'' that they are breaking safety rules, the report said. The F.A.A., responding to the report, said it had agreed to develop a streamlined process for dealing with infractions by passengers. The decision to issue a notice of violation would be made lower in the organization, it said, and passengers would be promised a 50 percent reduction in penalty if they paid within 30 days. The agency plans to publish a proposed rule next fall, the report said. Correction: November 30, 2004, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the Federal Aviation Administration's enforcement of restrictions on hazardous materials aboard airplanes referred incorrectly in some copies to the year of a ValuJet crash in Florida attributed to fire caused by oxygen generators carried on the plane. It was May 1996, not 1966."
"State regulators will require Honeywell International to conduct a $448 million cleanup of Onondaga Lake in Syracuse, one of the nation's most polluted bodies of water, according to people who have seen the plan, which is to be announced today. The plan, which will be open for public comment until March 1, 2005, requires Honeywell International to conduct extensive dredging of the lake bottom over the next seven years to remove much of the 165,000 pounds of mercury and other toxins that the state says have been dumped in the lake over the past decades. Honeywell is responsible for the cleanup because in 1999 it merged with Allied Chemical, which owned a plant that the state says dumped the toxins in the years before the plant closed in 1988. The state sued Allied Chemical in 1989 for polluting the lake. Honeywell has suggested a more limited cleanup approach that would cost closer to $237 million. On the other hand, the Onondaga Indian nation has expressed its concerns that the state's proposed plan is insufficient. ''The nation is deeply concerned that the Department of Environmental Conservation's preferred alternative for the cleanup of the bottom of the lake is not adequate and will leave substantial amounts of dangerous toxins throughout the lake bottom,'' Joseph J. Heath, a lawyer for the Onondaga nation, wrote in a letter on Wednesday to the commissioner of environmental conservation, Erin M. Crotty. The letter also said that state regulators did not consult with the nation's 14 chiefs about the plan it would propose, as is required by federal law because of the Onondagas' spiritual, historical and archaeological ties to the lake. ''We have had a constructive dialogue with all the interested parties in this effort,'' said a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Michael Fraser. ''We met with the Onondaga nation only a week ago and outlined our plans. We feel that that action was consistent with the federal requirements.'' Victoria Streitfeld, a spokeswoman for Honeywell International, which is based in Morristown, N.J., said, ''The company's proposal submitted in the feasibility study takes into consideration years of scientific and technical analysis and we will continue to refine the plans during D.E.C.'s public comment period.'' She added, ''We are committed to continuing to work with the state to finalize an approach and implement a remedy once the proposed plan is released.'' The Onondaga nation, which has about 2,500 remaining members, most of whom live on a reservation roughly eight miles south of Syracuse, have lived near the lake for centuries, Mr. Heath said. The lake is about four and a half miles long and a mile wide. A federal court ruling in the lawsuit involving the lake's pollution required the Department of Environmental Conservation to announce by today the cleanup plan it will require of Honeywell. State regulators want Honeywell to dredge up about 2.65 million cubic yards of mercury-contaminated sediments at lake depths ranging up to 30 feet, and to put a cap made mostly of sand and gravel on other contaminated areas of the lake bottom, Mr. Fraser said. Honeywell has proposed dredging 508,000 cubic yards. Pollution levels in the lake put it on the federal Superfund list of toxic waste sites in 1994. ''The state's plan hardly seems like a permanent solution to the lake's massive pollution problems,'' said Walter L.T. Hang, president of Toxics Targeting, an environmental research firm. The cost of a full remediation of the site, which would involve dredging and placing a permanent cap across the entire 2,329 acres of lake bottom, would be about $2.33 billion, according to department officials. The state's plan for Onondaga Lake is far less stringent than what federal regulators should require, Mr. Hang said. In the case of the Hudson River cleanup of PCB's, for example, which is being overseen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency rather than state regulators, the most contaminated areas of the river bottom will be completely removed. ''Capping is not allowed on the Hudson and should be avoided on Onondaga Lake because it is a Band-Aid approach that will surely fail,'' he said."
"When the Ford Motor Company closed its plant in Mahwah in 1980, the last car made there -- a two-tone beige Futura -- rolled off the assembly line and came to rest beneath a sign that exhorted workers to ''Do it Right the First Time.'' More than two decades later, people who live on land where Ford dumped thousands of cubic yards of chemical wastes from the plant are angry that the company did not live by its own rule. They say Ford did not get it right the first time, when it responded to federal orders to clean up the lead-based paint sludge and other wastes left over from the manufacture of 4.6 million cars. Or the second time. Or the third. Today, it takes no more than a stroll through the woods to see that parts of Ringwood, about 10 miles from Mahwah, are still heavily polluted. Chunks and slabs of hardened paint can be found where residents hunt, in the ponds and streams where they play and even in Bob De Groat's front yard and the properties of other residents. ''They just didn't do what they were supposed to do,'' said Patricia Mann, a Ringwood resident who belongs to the close-knit group recognized by New Jersey as the Ramapough Mountain Indian Tribe. ''They didn't do their job, and everybody knows it.'' The prolonged Ringwood cleanup is the classic example of how getting it right the first time is not always possible in environmental matters, especially when regulators are overextended and corporate polluters are in a hurry to close the books on an embarrassing episode. There is no question that the site remains heavily polluted. Both Ford and the federal Environmental Protection Agency acknowledge that substantial amounts of toxic paint sludge and other hazardous materials remain, even though officials had given the site a clean bill of health in 1994 when they took it off the Superfund list. Ford has promised to return, yet again, to take care of whatever wastes remain. ''Ford is aware of and is working closely with E.P.A. to address residents' concerns,'' the company said in a statement. Yet, two years ago, Ford filed a formal request to be relieved of responsibility for monitoring of the site, appearing to indicate that the cleanup was complete. The federal agency denied the request. Joseph A. Gowers, Ringwood project manager for the environmental agency, could not explain how a site that had been cleaned up and removed from the Superfund list could still be so contaminated. ''None of the waste should be there,'' he said. But he noted that the cleanup was complicated because Ford kept no records of what it dumped in Ringwood, and the site itself, more than 500 acres, is larger than most. ''It's almost like trying to find a needle in a haystack,'' Mr. Gowers said. Prompted by the most recent sludge discoveries, the agency is again studying the site, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry plans an updated health assessment of the area, but only by looking at death and disease statistics, not going door to door. People who live in this rugged wooded area near the New York State line say they do not believe this effort will be any better than the other cleanups, which they described as halfhearted at best. Had Ford really meant to clean up, they say, it would have asked them exactly where the hazardous material was buried, since they lived close enough to hear the dump trucks and see the debris spilling out of them. Had the E.P.A. truly watched out for the health of the residents as it was supposed to, they say, it would never have allowed itself to be manipulated and deceived by a large corporation with no real commitment to cleaning up after itself. And there is another, darker suspicion: residents say that their concerns have been repeatedly ignored or minimized because they are a poorly understood minority group with no political or economic power. Some historians believe that many of the families who live here are descendants of slaves freed by Dutch owners before the American Revolution. Members of the enclave say their ancestors were Native Americans who mixed with African-Americans working in mines that dated back to the Revolutionary period. ''If this was a different group of people, it wouldn't have happened, or it would have been cleaned up 30 years ago and not be allowed to continue until now,'' said Wayne Mann, 44, president of the Ringwood Neighborhood Action Association. Mr. Mann said that in the two decades since Ford's pollution was officially recognized, no government health agency has offered physical exams or studied the high rates of illness in the community. Had they looked, he contends, they would have noticed that many residents have learning disabilities -- something he attributes, possibly, to exposure to lead. Many residents also have come down with cancer and other illnesses, he said, which they fear were caused by their contact with Ford's toxic residue. Serious skin problems and rashes are common around here, but few people have been as afflicted as Mickey Van Dunk, 33, who spends most of his days either in bed or smoking cigarettes on his front porch, shying away from other people because his skin looks as if it is being eaten away. Mr. Van Dunk has been through many painful operations to remove infected patches of skin all over his body. He believes his condition was caused by exposure to the paint sludge, which looks like hardened gray dough and was so commonly seen when he was a boy, he said, that he and his friends molded it into balls and threw it at one another as they played in the woods. Mr. Van Dunk's illness has been diagnosed as hidradenitis suppurativa. It is not known to be caused by exposure to chemicals, and people with tightly curled hair, like Mr. Van Dunk and many of his relatives, are known to have a genetic predisposition to it, according to studies on the condition. Many people in the community, including his mother, his cousin, Jared, and Mr. Mann have the same condition, though not as severely. But they say they believe that Ford's chemicals are the cause. Mr. Gowers, of the E.P.A., said the presence of the paint sludge in the Ringwood community by itself does not necessarily present a health risk because most of it has been found in the woods, not next to homes, and has been exposed as the ground erodes. Repeated testing has not shown any groundwater contamination in the area or in the Wanaque Reservoir, about a mile away. Government officials say Ford has cooperated fully in the cleanup efforts from the beginning. The company acknowledges that it dumped paint sludge and car parts on an area of several hundred acres and in two old mine shafts in Ringwood that it bought in 1965. Ford had planned to build a housing and light industrial development there, but when that project fell through the company started dumping wastes there instead. ''I remember dump trucks and roll-offs come up here all the time to dump copper, batteries and paint sludge,'' Mr. Mann said. ''They'd open the big back doors and the sludge would just slide out. It looked like clay, but it had a sheen, like a rainbow.'' Ford officials say they did not keep records of what was dumped or where. In 1987, contractors hired by the company removed 7,000 cubic yards of paint sludge that was highly contaminated with lead and other hazards. In 1990, 17 steel drums filled with chemicals and a number of crushed barrels were also removed. In 1994, the E.P.A. took the Ringwood site off the Superfund list, but ordered Ford to monitor the site for at least five more years. After the initial monitoring period ended, only small amounts of contaminants were detected, but the government ordered Ford to continue monitoring for another five years. Traces of lead and arsenic were found in some wells. Though it was thought to have occurred naturally, the government ordered the company to continue testing. When Ford asked for permission to end the monitoring in 2002, the government again denied the company's request. In recent months, as Mr. Mann and other residents found more paint sludge, they brought in a Philadelphia law firm to represent the community. ''The fact that the E.P.A. claimed that this site was cleaned up is mind-boggling,'' said Stephen A. Sheller, of the law firm, Sheller, Ludwig & Badey. A chemical engineer hired by Mr. Sheller's firm is sharply critical of Ford's $2.5 million cleanup effort, and of the E.P.A.'s oversight of the project. The engineer, Melvyn Kopstein, has done a chemical analysis of paint sludge recently found by residents and determined that it contains lead and arsenic well in excess of federal safety standards. ''The E.P.A. applied a 'see no evil, hear no evil' theme to this site,'' Dr. Kopstein said in a long memo summarizing his investigation. Ford has already submitted a work plan for continued water sampling, and has told residents it will remove the sludge found on Bob De Groat's front yard and anyplace else it can be found. Mr. Mann remains skeptical about the company's commitment, and the government's oversight. ''Ford keeps coming back to clean up stuff that isn't supposed to be there,'' he said. ''Unless something changes, they'll be coming back forever.''"
"The Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday that the amount of toxic chemicals released into the environment increased by 5 percent in 2002, only the second time conditions grew worse since the yearly Toxic Release Inventory began in 1987. Agency officials said the latest jump, following a 15 percent decrease for 2001, was generally attributable to one large copper-smelting operation in Arizona. Otherwise, they said, the overall level of toxic release would have fallen by 3 percent for 2002, the most recent year for which data is available. They also said that if mining operations were not included in the latest inventory -- and they should not be, according to a 2003 Federal District Court decision that changed the definition of mining disposal -- the overall release for 2002 would be 15 percent below the year before. While the agency report found that the release of dioxins had fallen by 5 percent, the levels of mercury rose by 10 percent and lead by 3.2 percent. The agency released the data on the same day that two environmental groups -- the Environmental Integrity Project and the Galveston-Houston Association for Smog Prevention -- issued a study that said the toxic releases reported to the E.P.A. were ''four to five times'' lower across the country than was accurate. The groups said the discrepancy occurred because the agency allowed companies to use dated methods of collecting information and because it trusted the companies to monitor themselves. The study was based on measurements of the emissions of 10 toxic substances from chemical plants and refineries in and around Houston. Those results were then fed into a computer model that extrapolated results for the rest of the country. Kelly Haragan, a lawyer for the Environmental Integrity Project, said the material for the report was generated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, making Texas the first state to analyze reporting data from chemical plants and refineries in its jurisdiction. Ms. Haragan said Texas found that emissions of some substances with known adverse health effects, including ethylene, propylene and butadiene, were more than 400 percent higher than officially reported. ''Other studies in the United States have shown underreporting,'' Ms. Haragan said, alluding to efforts in Pennsylvania and California. ''But Texas is the only place that has given us a method to demonstrate how extreme the underreporting is.'' Kim Nelson, head of the E.P.A.'s office of environmental information, avoided characterizing the agency's latest inventory as good or bad news. Ms. Nelson questioned the results of the environmental groups' study, saying the E.P.A. had seen no evidence of systematic underreporting. ''We would look at trends, and where we see significant underreporting, we would investigate,'' Ms. Nelson said in a conference call with reporters. ''If the reports are inaccurate, we would apply enforcement actions.'' She said hundreds of facilities had been notified of potential violations for delaying their reports. She said none were under investigation for deliberately underreporting the amounts of toxic releases. Bob Slaughter, president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, a trade organization, attacked the study by the environmental groups as erroneous and misleading, pointing out that toxic emissions ''have declined in part because of actions taken by the refining industry.'' Addressing the conclusions of the E.P.A. inventory, Scott Segal, an energy industry lobbyist, argued that the agency's annual inventory provided a poor measure of toxic emissions because it gathered information on so many toxic chemicals, about 650, from nearly 25,000 facilities. Mr. Segal said a more reliable yardstick was the information collected from 300 air monitor sites around the country, which he said had shown a 31 percent decrease of toxic emissions from 1993 to 2002. Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, took aim at the E.P.A., saying: ''The era of big government may be over, but the era of toxic pollution is back. After three years of weakened regulation and no enforcement, every polluting industry in America clearly feels free to put whatever they want into the air and water. In previous years, we saw real, substantial decreases of emissions every year. Not anymore.''"
"OUTSIDE, a hard winter's afternoon settles on the village, but inside their cottage Nikolai and Nastia lay out a spread: apples from their orchard, pickles from their garden, mushrooms from the woods around and full glasses of samogon, otherwise known as Ukrainian moonshine. Samogon, the locals say, offers protection from radioactivity, a consideration since we are in a ''black village'' written off for human occupation in 1986 after the explosion of Reactor 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power station a mere dozen miles away. ''You grow your own food?'' a guest asks. ''All of it,'' Nastia says. The guest takes a discreet glance at his dosimeter. The village is called ''black'' as in abandoned. But as if to make the name literally true, the neighboring houses have turned black and tilted into a slow slide into the earth. Trees reach in and out the windows. The yards are littered with bureaus, picture frames, chairs. At the beginning of the cleanup, the authorities buried the most radioactive houses, until it dawned on them that they were doing an excellent job of poisoning the groundwater. So the contaminated houses stand. For how long? According to an ecologist at the power station: ''In 250 years everything is back to normal. Except for plutonium -- that will take 25,000 years.'' Nikolai and Nastia's cottage is basically one room around an oven with a built-in shelf to sleep on during the coldest nights. ''It's home,'' Nastia says. She wears a sweater and shawl permanently. Her smile is bright steel and her blue eyes shine with delight and a certain sense of collusion. Visitors are rare in the 19-mile-radius Zone of Exclusion around the reactors and, of course, she is not supposed to be there at all. Nastia and Nikolai were evacuated like everyone else, but sneaked like partisans back to their cottage in the woods. So much for zone security. Since then, the authorities have largely let Nastia and Nikolai alone among the zone's phantom population of returnees, scavengers and poachers. Almost perversely, the wildlife there is flourishing; poachers hunt wild boar, served later in the finest restaurants of Kiev and Moscow. Scavengers cut up abandoned radioactive cars and trucks are to sell as parts in the chop shops of Russia. Nikolai and Nastia aren't on the run, they've just become invisible. They didn't vote in the recent presidential runoff election; there were no polling booths in the black villages. (To vote, they would have had to be bused out of the zone to cast a ballot bearing the address they had been assigned to and escaped from.) Doctors warned Nastia that if she remains in her village, radioactivity will give her cancer in 25 years. Nastia is 75 now. She says she'll take her chances. Nastia sings a traditional harvest song in a young, birdlike voice. The samogon has brought out a fine sweat on every brow. What amazes me is not that two elderly peasants have become invisible, but that Chernobyl itself has, as if it were a subject too awful to contemplate. In the rain, the sarcophagus, the 10-story steel-and-concrete box heroically constructed over Reactor 4, leaks like a radioactive sieve into groundwater that drains in the Pripyat River, which feeds the Dnepr, which is the drinking water for Kiev. Ninety percent of the core is still in the reactor, breaking down and heating up, and the station's managers say that the sarcophagus itself could collapse at any time. How dangerous would that be? Estimates of deaths from the explosion range from 41 to more than 300,000. The Zone of Exclusion is not an area of containment, no more than a circle drawn on the dirt would stop an airborne stream of plutonium, strontium, cesium-137. Seven million people live on contaminated land in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. People around the world carry in their chromosomes the mark of Chernobyl. We search in Iraq for weapons of mass destruction, while a more likely danger is another explosion at Chernobyl. It may not be a meltdown, but it will be the mother of all dirty bombs. (A better sarcophagus is promised in five years, but at the site there is little sign of activity, let alone urgency.) And in all the drama of the recent election, the inspiring rallies in Independence Square, the spirited presidential debate on Monday and the apparent triumph of good over evil, the subject of another nuclear disaster rarely came up, and then mostly in nationalist rhetoric: it is an article of faith that the West forced Ukraine in 2000 to close the perfectly good reactors that remained at Chernobyl. The truth is that you have to sympathize with Viktor Yushchenko, the likely winner in the rerun of the presidential runoff on Sunday, because he will have to deal with Chernobyl. Or not. So, no wonder we're drinking samogon. The air is yeasty with it. Nastia sings and I picture her and Nikolai plucking apples off their poisoned tree, digging potatoes from their poisoned earth, fishing in their poisoned stream.

"An internal company report warned top executives at the Newmont Mining Corporation, the world's largest gold producer, in 2001 that the company was putting tons of toxic mercury vapors into the air in Indonesia. The document, shown to The New York Times by a person close to Newmont, sheds new light on operations at one of the most troubled mines of a Fortune 500 company based in Denver that has drawn the rising ire of environmental groups and local communities over the impact of its operations. The report adds fuel to charges from Indonesian officials who say they intend to prosecute the company for pollution, as well as accusations by former employees that Newmont willfully flouted environmental safeguards around the globe. In its public statements, Newmont consistently says that it regards American environmental standards as its measure overseas. In a 90-minute interview this month at Newmont headquarters, two top executives denied that the company acted outside American or Indonesian law and that its operations or the mercury harmed local people. But in a 2001 company memorandum, also seen by The Times, Lawrence T. Kurlander, then a senior vice president and chief administrative officer, admonished his senior colleagues that Newmont had ''told the world'' it upheld American environmental rules abroad, when in fact it did not. He suggested that because of the failure to live up to Newmont's advertised standards, he and his colleagues should forfeit their annual bonuses. The concern, he said, extended to operations in Peru and Uzbekistan, as well as Indonesia. Villagers at Buyat Bay, near the Newmont mine on the northern island of Sulawesi, sued the company for $543 million in August after complaining about dizziness, difficult breathing, tumors and skin diseases, which they say began soon after Newmont started mining in 1996. Experts consulted on the emissions said they probably posed greater risk to the mine's workers than to the villagers, but agreed that airborne mercury was one of the mining by-product's most toxic forms. Glenn Miller, a professor of environmental science at the University of Nevada and a specialist in mining and mercury, described the totals as ''an outrageous amount of mercury to put into the atmosphere.'' The report examined by The Times says that some 33 tons of mercury that Indonesian officials say should have been collected and sent to a legal dump for toxic waste were put into the environment over four years. About 17 tons were sent into the air and 16 more tons released into the bay, the audit says. In the interview, the Newmont executives defended the company's operations but did not dispute the mercury totals and acknowledged that they were aware of the emissions even before the findings of what they called a draft report. ''Today I don't think it is under dispute -- that 16 and 17,'' David H. Francisco, executive vice president for operations, said of the totals. ''Is there an impact, is it harmful, is it within the accepted limits we have as an industry, that governments have established? Yeah, I think there was an impact. On the other hand, no, it didn't negatively impact on the bay and the people.'' The Indonesian minister of the environment, Rachmat Witolear, said that ''Newmont was breaking the law'' in Indonesia because it lacked a permit, required under a 1997 statute, to put toxic material into the environment. Newmont maintains that it had the permits it needed, but it did not share the audit's findings with the government. The Newmont audit itself classifies the finding on mercury as ''significant,'' meaning that it could pose an ''imminent risk'' to human health and the environment or result in a violation that could cause a plant closure or loss of permits. The Newmont executives said those warnings were about ''potential issues.'' But the emissions were enough of a real concern that the company went to the trouble of installing a bulky, nearly $10 million pollution-control device known as a scrubber. As Newmont sought to ''optimize gold recovery,'' the audit said, the device did not work much of the time it was supposed to. The audit says the company also issued its workers badges designed to detect potentially dangerous levels of mercury in the air. But those did not work either, the document says. The report was part of a round of audits initiated by the company to assess global operations after a subcontractor spilled some 330 pounds of mercury in 2000 along a road near a mine in Peru. Hundreds of villagers say they were made sick by the spill in a lawsuit filed against Newmont. The audit of the Peru mine, Yanacocha, also criticized a range of operations and cited violations that were subject to substantial fines, two former employees familiar with the audits said. The company was forced to call off plans to expand operations in Peru in November after local people angrily protested. In his memorandum dated Jan. 18, 2001, to Wayne W. Murdy, who had just been appointed Newmont's chief executive, Mr. Kurlander wrote of the Peru mine that in December 2000 ''we, the senior management team, learned for the first time we do not operate environmentally by U.S. standards.'' ''Our environment teams are not the ministers of good news,'' the letter scolded, ''they are the guardians of our most treasured asset: our reputation.'' Mr. Kurlander, who left the company in 2002, continued, ''Moreover, there is concern we are not operating at U.S. standards'' in Uzbekistan and Indonesia. Mr. Murdy said in an e-mail to The Times that he did ''not have a specific recollection'' of the memo, but that the issues described were being discussed by senior management at the time. Bonuses, he said, saw a ''significant deduction'' after the Peru spill. Newmont has become the gold industry's leader since the 1990's by rapidly expanding on five continents. Under increased scrutiny since the controversy at Buyat Bay, the company has defended methods that it says are common practice but that critics say have escaped rigorous regulation, even in the United States. Applying Standards In defending the Indonesian operations, David A. Baker, vice president for environmental affairs who was interviewed with Mr. Francisco, said Newmont applied the same standards on mercury emissions here that it would in Nevada. ''Those emissions were within the limits that were identified in the Indonesian permitting process and were well within any standard or requirement,'' Mr. Baker said. Nevada, the center of American gold mining, has more mercury emissions than any other state and also the most relaxed standards for mercury in the country, said Professor Miller, the mercury specialist. In a lawsuit against the company, two former employees who were dismissed by Newmont leveled similar accusations of disregard for environmental rules at operations in Nevada in 2001. Neither the state nor the Environmental Protection Agency regulates mercury emissions at Nevada mines, except as water pollutants, Professor Miller said. Newmont's Indonesia mine averaged more than four tons of mercury in the air annually, about equal to the largest similar emission at an American mine in Nevada in the late 1990's, he said. But one former Newmont employee familiar with the Indonesian mine's operations said that in 1998, when the mine was at the height of production and the mercury scrubber was often not working, the emissions into the air could have been as much as eight tons or more. Since 2001, Professor Miller said, the E.P.A. has cut emissions at Nevada mines by 40 percent, but he noted that it had done so by relying on voluntary agreements. ''Newmont is a good actor in Nevada on mercury,'' he said. ''What they have done in Nevada and what they have done in Indonesia is a world apart.'' An American toxicologist, Joe Rodricks, whom Newmont recommended as a mercury specialist, said he had been told by the company that when the scrubber was in operation, emissions at the Indonesian mine met the standards for airborne mercury in Nevada. ''My understanding is that the times when they didn't meet the standards was when the scrubber was not working,'' he said. But he said he did not think the airborne mercury would have harmed local people. An E.P.A. official who specializes in mercury and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that if as much as 17 tons of mercury was put in the air over four years by a mine in the United States, the agency would investigate to see what the health effects had been. The hazards of mercury, which are drawing increasing attention in the United States, can range from neurological damage and learning disabilities to skin irritations, and are particularly threatening to children and fetal development. Indonesian officials said they decided to prosecute Newmont based on the findings of a recent government-sponsored study. It found significant levels of mercury and arsenic in the sediment and bottom-feeding organisms at Buyat Bay, indicating that the pollutants had entered the food chain as Newmont deposited some five million tons of mine waste about a half mile off shore over the life of the mine. The villagers at Buyat Bay filed their lawsuit after the death of a baby born with what they described as ''deformities.'' No autopsy was done on the child, and the cause of the villagers' ailments has not been definitively determined. Newmont vigorously contests the way the samples were analyzed for the government study and says the disposal system it used met American standards. An E.P.A. official said that system was effectively banned in the United States. Charges and Defenses Since the controversy at the bay, the company has been on the defensive. The Denver Post, one of Newmont's hometown newspapers, devoted two days of coverage this month to what it said were ''significant environmental failures at Newmont's mines across the globe,'' including mercury emissions in Indonesia and other breaches in Nevada, Peru and Turkey. After an initial article on the dispute at Buyat Bay appeared in The New York Times in September, Mr. Murdy, the chief executive, called the allegations of pollution ''a blatant lie.'' This month, he flew to Indonesia but failed to stave off the criminal charges, which involve senior employees. Mr. Witolear, the environment minister, said the police and the prosecutor's office were finalizing the case. It is expected to go to court early next year, he said. Regarding Indonesia, Mr. Francisco, the executive vice president for operations, described the decision to install a mercury scrubber as ''an example of Newmont trying to do the right thing.'' But, the audit said, in 1997 the company processed ore with high mercury content by ''roasting'' it at high temperatures on 84 days before the scrubber arrived. After it arrived, the audit said, the scrubber did not function on 213 of 310 days in 1998. A major reason for the breakdown, according to the audit, was that the mine operators had increased the heat during the roasting in order to maximize the recovery of gold. ''The mercury scrubber facility does not have the physical ability to handle the entire volume of gases now emitted from the roaster,'' the Newmont document warned. Pictures with the audit showed filters from the device torn out of the machine and strewn on the ground. Mr. Baker said that the scrubber was operated at the designed temperature, but had been clogged by dust. The company responded to the audit, he said, by fixing the scrubber in mid-2001. That was just weeks before Newmont finished mining. He declined to say who had made the decision to continue operations while the scrubber was not working. ''I'm just going to answer it like this,'' he said, ''What we've done at that site was protective of human health and the environment.'' Assessing the Costs Two former employees said the decision was made at Denver headquarters to cut costs and maximize gold retrieval at a time when Newmont was saddled with debt and gold prices had reached a nearly 20-year low. ''Decisions come downwards,'' said one former executive who was intimately familiar with operations at the site. ''It's always about cost.'' Ellen Silbergeld, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and who is directing a mercury study in Latin America, said airborne mercury was particularly dangerous in tropical climates, like that in Indonesia, because it changes more quickly into a form that can enter the food chain. ''All forms of mercury are toxic, and mercury vapors are extremely toxic,'' she said. Newmont executives emphasize that recent tests overseen by the World Health Organization show the villagers do not have Minamata disease, an acute form of methylmercury poisoning named for the fishing village in Japan that suffered one of history's most prominent industrial disasters from mercury waste. But Professor Silbergeld noted: ''The criteria for mercury poisoning is not Minamata disease. That's like saying the criteria for heart disease is death.'' The specialist from the Minamata Institute, Mineshi Sakamoto, who conducted the tests for the W.H.O., said that while he did not find Minamata disease, he was convinced that the bay was polluted from the mine waste. Newmont finished operations in August. ''The environment is completely destroyed, and the people became sick,'' Mr. Sakamoto said. ''But it is very difficult to know the cause of the sicknesses.''"
"Thousands of residents of the resort barrier islands off the coast here returned for a look at their homes on Wednesday for the first time since Hurricane Charley made its devastating trip through Florida five days ago. For the owners of homes and businesses on the islands of Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel and Captiva the return to their properties was another step in a recovery that is taking hold along the hurricane's path. But the progress was tempered by the reality that relief will not be quick. Electricity is not expected to be restored to Sanibel and Captiva for as much as a month -- longer than most of the other damaged areas. ''The house in uninhabitable,'' said Robert Janes, a Lee County commissioner who went to look at his three-bed house on stilts on Sanibel, a popular vacation spot, with his wife, Lynda. ''There's no water. No electricity. You can't use the sewage system.'' Across the state, the lights went on on Wednesday for the first time for tens of thousands of Floridians who have been sweltering without air conditioning during the day and making do with candles and flashlights and portable lamps after the sun has gone down. The restoration of electricity has been rolling across the disaster area with more people getting back one of their fundamental necessities every day since the hurricane took down hundreds of miles of power lines last Friday and Saturday. Most of the people who took shelter in schools and other public buildings have found other places to live even if they cannot yet go home. By Wednesday, the officials said only 2,032 people were still living in the shelters. Most state roads are open, the officials said, but some streets are still blocked with debris in the hardest hit areas near the Gulf Coast. All airports are back in operation, the officials said. In places like Punta Gorda and Arcadia, where the damage is worst, mobile kitchens have been set up. By Wednesday the kitchens had served more than 288,000 meals. Throughout the state, officials have distributed nearly 765,000 gallons of water. There have been few reports of looting, perhaps at least partly because of the strong security force that has filled the streets. HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE OVERVIEW"
"The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday that fish in virtually all of the nation's lakes and rivers were contaminated with mercury, a highly toxic metal that poses health risks for pregnant women and young children. Michael O. Leavitt, the E.P.A. administrator, drew his conclusion from the agency's latest annual survey of fish advisories, which showed that 48 states -- all but Wyoming and Alaska -- issued warnings about mercury last year. That compared with 44 states in 1993, when the surveys were first conducted. The latest survey also shows that 19 states, including New York, have now put all their lakes and rivers under a statewide advisory for fish consumption. But Mr. Leavitt said that the widespread presence of mercury reflected a surge in monitoring -- not an increase in emissions -- as part of growing state efforts to warn local anglers about the fish they are catching. Last year, states issued 3,094 advisories for toxic substances, compared with 1,233 in 1993. ''Mercury is everywhere,'' Mr. Leavitt said at a news conference in his office. ''The more waters we monitor, the more we find mercury. Monitoring is up and will continue to go up. But emissions are down and will continue to go down.'' The latest survey represents monitoring from 35 percent of the nation's lakes, more than 100,000 of them; 24 percent of total river miles, nearly 850,000 miles; 75 percent of coastal waters; and all of the Great Lakes. The E.P.A. also provided a chart showing the level of mercury emission from human causes fell 45 percent in 1999 from 1990. The agency said that was the most recent data it had available. Mr. Leavitt promised to issue the nation's first regulations for mercury emissions ''within a few months.'' The plan, with a deadline of March 15, 2005, has gained industry support because of the likelihood it will include a ''cap-and-trade program'' that lets companies buy and sell credits that give them a pollution allowance, which would save them in cleanup costs. ''Even in light of new monitoring data,'' said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, an industry group, ''a well-designed cap-and-trade program remains the most appropriate response to dealing with mercury emissions from power plants.'' But environmentalists, as well as President Bush's Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry, have attacked the Bush administration's proposed standards as weak and unnecessarily drawn out. The administration has proposed reducing emissions 29 percent by 2010 and 69 percent by 2018. Emily Figdor, a policy analyst for Clear the Air, a coalition of environmental groups, said, ''The technology is available now to reduce emissions by 90 percent by 2008, as the Clean Air Act requires, but there is no indication that the administration is considering a stronger proposal.'' Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, accused the administration of ''dragging its feet'' by endorsing a weak plan. A spokesman for Mr. Kerry accused the Bush administration of proposing standards that industry lobbyists helped write, a criticism the E.P.A. has denied, and said Mr. Kerry, as president, would support sharper reductions in a shorter period of time. ''With George Bush in the White House, you better think twice before you eat the fish you catch,'' said the spokesman, Phil Singer. ''While the Bush administration has opted for a lobbyist-written approach to mercury emissions, John Kerry will go further faster and be more effective in ridding our lakes and rivers of poisons that threaten pregnant women and children. Despite evidence that fish caught almost anywhere in the country is contaminated with mercury, Mr. Leavitt repeatedly urged reporters to consider the increasing number of advisories in the larger context of more aggressive actions by states in monitoring and by the administration in moving toward new regulations. Pointing out that the Clinton administration waited until its final days to propose mercury emission regulations, which were later challenged in court, he said Mr. Bush deserved credit for proposing regulations and providing technical assistance to other countries working to reduce mercury emissions. It remains unclear what would happen to the Bush proposal if Mr. Kerry were to win in November. ''That's an eventuality,'' Mr. Leavitt said, ''that I have not considered.''"
"First the fish began to disappear. Then villagers began developing strange rashes and bumps. Finally in January, Masna Stirman, aided by a $1.50 wet nurse, gave birth to a tiny, shriveled girl with small lumps and wrinkled skin. ''The nurse said: 'Ma'am, the baby has deformities,''' Mrs. Stirman, 39, recalled in an interview. Unable to get any meaningful medical help in this remote fishing village of about 300 people, she watched as her fourth child suffered for months and then died in July. The infant's death came after years of complaints by local fishermen about waste dumped in the ocean by the owner of a nearby gold mine, the Newmont Mining Corporation, the world's biggest gold producer, based in Denver. It also kicked up a political brawl pitting Indonesia's feisty environmental groups against the American mining giant, which has been trailed by allegations of pollution on four continents. The fight has aroused intense interest in mining circles and among environmental groups for the fresh concerns it raises about how rich multinational companies -- especially those that extract resources like coal, copper and gold as well as oil and natural gas -- conduct themselves in poor nations. For Newmont, the battle is only the latest round of troubles as the company, concerned by the more stringent rules for mining permits in the United States, seeks greater growth from operations overseas, where environmental groups and, increasingly, government officials charge that it employs practices not tolerated at home. No definitive cause has been found for the illnesses among the villagers. Company executives, Newmont said in a statement, were ''convinced that we are not polluting the waters of Buyat Bay or adversely affecting the health of the people in that area.'' But on Aug. 31, an Indonesian government panel announced that Newmont ''had illegally disposed'' of waste containing arsenic and mercury in the ocean near the mine site, and had failed to get the required permits from the Ministry of Environment since 1996. The environment minister, Nabiel Makarim, said the company might face criminal charges. The findings came a week after a local legal aid group filed a suit on behalf of three villagers, including the baby's mother, in a district court in South Jakarta, alleging that they and the baby had been made sick by the mine waste. They are seeking $543 million in damages. The company denied the charges and said in its statement that it ''operates in full compliance with Indonesian and U.S. environmental standards.'' Newmont has run into trouble before, even at home. But some of the gravest allegations of polluting mining practices have come from its operations in developing nations, from Indonesia to Peru to Turkey. Here, the fight with Newmont has fueled a growing popular impression that mining and energy companies hold a tight grip over Indonesia's weak regulatory system. Many blame the corruption, cronyism and unevolved legal structure inherited from General Suharto, the dictator whose rule ended in 1998 and who, for a price, eagerly opened the doors to foreign investors. When Newmont first came looking for gold in Indonesia in the 1980's, it dealt with the Suharto government. Since then, a handful of officials knowledgeable about the environment have said they wanted to stand up to Newmont and other companies, but lost the battles. In Newmont's case, correspondence shows that from 2000 to 2002 the Ministry of Environment challenged Newmont about the toxicity of the mine waste it was dumping at Buyat Bay. In a letter to Newmont in March 2002, a senior ministry official, Isa Karnisa Ardiputra, listed seven points of concern and asked for ''immediate action.'' In an interview at Newmont's Jakarta headquarters on Aug. 27, the president of Newmont in Indonesia, Richard B. Ness, and other company officials said they were not aware of the letter. Emil Salim, a minister of the environment during the Suharto era, who is overseeing the panel that found Newmont had acted illegally, reflected the anger of many Indonesians over the dumping of waste that was allowed to go on for years despite such challenges from parts of the government. ''We are weak in governance in mining,'' he said. Using the mine industry's word to describe the waste, Mr. Salim said he had told the company: ''I am not against you. But please don't put your tailings in our ocean.'' Some sense a potential turning point in the outrage stirred by the death of Mrs. Stirman's baby. The mother was told by a doctor, Sandra Rotty, an Indonesian who works at the Newmont financed health center at nearby Ratatok, that the child had a common skin disease. After examining the baby in April, Dr. Rotty wrote to a local environmental group, Kelola, that the baby's skin ''disorder'' was ''caused by malnutrition.'' ''Now, the baby's condition is already better,'' she added. When the child showed no improvement, however, the group asked a team of public health doctors to visit Buyat Bay. About 120 villagers were waiting to be examined in June in the ad hoc clinic set up in three local homes. Thirty of the villagers had tumor-like growths, said one of the doctors, Jane Pangemanan. ''I was shocked by what I saw,'' she said in an interview. Of the 60 people she examined, about 80 percent showed symptoms of poisoning by mercury and arsenic, she said. On a recent visit to the community, and judging from the villagers who came to the Jakarta courthouse for the opening of the case on Aug. 27, the health problems were evident at almost every turn. One of the babies had a cyst the size of a small pea on the end of her tongue. A mother had two lumps on her breasts the size of golf balls. One woman had a large lump down her left side that made her look half pregnant. A lawyer for Newmont, Palmer Situmorang, said the lumps and skin diseases that the villagers complained about were the result of ''poor sanitation and poor nutrition.'' ''They are liars because their orientation is to just get money,'' he said. But an environmental scientist, Evan Edinger, who is an assistant professor at the University of Newfoundland in Canada and who is working with the Indonesian environmental group Friends of the Earth, said he believed that arsenic in the mine waste was the main cause of the illnesses. In laboratory tests in Canada, he found that about 30 percent of the arsenic in the sediment from Buyat Bay was soluble in weak acid environments, like the digestive tracts of worms, he said in an interview. ''Our hypothesis is that if you have sediment-feeding organisms and bottom-dwelling fish eat them, then that could be the pathway to contamination from arsenic,'' Mr. Edinger said. Newmont's own laboratory results also show high levels of arsenic in the sediment. But the company contends that the arsenic remains inert and nonsoluble in the ocean. In a paper released to the news media, Newmont said that ''collectively, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that mining activity at Minahasa has resulted in arsenic contamination of Buyat Bay biological ecosystem.'' The national police chief in Indonesia, Gen. Da'i Bachtiar, released the police's own laboratory results in August that showed mercury contamination of the sea. The company disputed the results, saying the police did not measure dissolved mercury. But General Da'i's chief investigator in the case, Sulistiandriatmoko, retorted: ''We are not that stupid. We measured the dissolved mercury, not the total mercury. I think they are just trying to distort the case.'' The Newmont mine above Buyat Bay is on the northern tip of Sulawesi in Minahasa, a region where fishermen in handmade wooden boats have been trawling for hundreds of years. Where small vanilla, clove and coconut plantations once prospered, Newmont carved five pits into the brown earth. With its relatively low costs and high-grade gold that was easy to get at, it was a ''little model of a mine,'' said Ali Sahami, a geologist who works as one of Newmont's environmental advisers. At the height of production from 1998 to 2000, the mine was producing nearly 25 percent of the company's international output. Newmont finished mining in 2001 and has since been processing mined ore, work it was scheduled to complete on Aug. 31. Villagers say the fish off their beach were once so plentiful they would start a fire for grilling before setting off to catch the evening meal. But almost immediately after mining operations started, the fish stocks dropped dramatically. Rasit Rahman, a squat man with a thick tangle of black hair, who had a lump removed from the back of his neck recently, was one of the plaintiffs who appeared in court on Aug. 27. ''My catch dwindled so fast after the mine came, I could no longer afford to send my youngest son to school,'' he said. Before the mine company came to the area in 1996, he said, he could earn $30 a day, a substantial amount in a village without electricity and running water. ''We had to look for another place to catch fish,'' he said. ''It was so much harder, and we were getting so little.'' At issue is Newmont's use of a waste disposal method, effectively banned in the United States under the Clean Water Act, that is called submarine tailing disposal. It involves piping treated mine waste into the ocean. Newmont uses the method not only at the mine near Buyat Bay, but also at its far bigger copper and gold mine on the island of Sumbawa. The legal aid group, Agency for Health Law, which has brought the suit on behalf of the villagers, charges that the system polluted the warm equatorial waters around the village, where people depend almost exclusively on fish for food as well as for their livelihoods. In the interview at the company's headquarters, Mr. Ness, the Newmont president in Indonesia, defended the use of the waste system. He also made that case before an Indonesian parliamentary committee in August. He said it was more ''responsible'' to put the waste in the sea than store it on land that could be subject to earthquakes. Furthermore, he said, ''Tailings are nothing more than ground-up rock.'' Others disagree. Environmental groups vociferously oppose the sea disposal of waste. Some mining companies, like the Australian giant BHP Billiton, say they would not use such a method in current projects, even though it is cheaper than land-based waste storage. Robert E. Moran, a hydrogeologist who advises mining companies and environmental groups, said in a telephone interview from Colorado that ''clearly tailings are much more complex chemically than crushed rock -- or else they would not require detoxification treatment prior to disposal.'' The waste from the mine being released into the sea amounted to a potentially ''toxic soup,'' he said. Mr. Moran, who reviewed partial analyses from the plant made available by Newmont, said he was confident that the waste consisted of metal-like elements like arsenic and antimony and metals like mercury, cadmium, lead, copper and zinc. Those substances in the rock where the gold is found, he said, are treated with sodium cyanide, and the subsequent mixture is treated again with other chemicals in an attempt to reduce the concentration of cyanides. In all likelihood, Mr. Moran said, some amount of cyanide compounds and other organic chemicals remained in the waste that was released into the ocean less than a half mile off shore at a relatively shallow depth of about 82 meters. In tropical waters like those around Buyat Bay, the toxic compounds often became ''more mobile and more accessible to the food chain than in temperate waters,'' Mr. Moran said. Washington's political risk insurance agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, does not like the submarine tailing disposal system, either. In the late 1990's, the agency refused to give insurance to a mine operated by Rio Tinto in Papua New Guinea on the grounds that the mine's submarine tailing system would violate United States domestic regulations. Newmont will essentially leave the site near Buyat Bay early next year, although a small skeleton staff will be on hand for three years to complete reclamation and oversee some community development projects, Newmont officials said. To its critics, Newmont says its mine closure plan will leave a community better off than when the company arrived. The plan shows photographs of a new school and groups of happy children splashing in clean water. But the villagers at the beach say they are uninterested. They are no longer able to sell their fish in the local markets. In addition to the illnesses that many now suffer, their livelihoods are shattered, said Anwar Stirman, the brother of Mrs. Stirman. ''We can no longer make money from the fish,'' Mr. Stirman said. ''We're talking to the provincial officials about our future. The whole village is waiting to be moved to another location.'' In any event, Newmont contends that the sea at Buyat Bay is in fine shape. The company ran color advertisements saying so in 10 Indonesian newspapers at the end of August. ''We find the water is in excellent condition,'' said Robert Humberson, general manager for external relations. ''I dive there myself. It's fabulous.'' Correction: September 13, 2004, Monday An article on Wednesday about pollution accusations in Indonesia directed against the Newmont Mining Company, the world's biggest gold producer, misstated the affiliation of Evan Edinger, an environmental scientist who has analyzed mining waste in Buyat Bay. He is an assistant professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, in Canada; there is no University of Newfoundland."
"In the wreckage left by the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Charley and Frances, engineers, researchers and others are finding some hope that this combination of disasters may do what no single storm has -- cause everyone along the United States' southern and eastern coasts to start building with the worst in mind. On Sunday, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said that this tempestuous season, in which regions unscathed for decades had been scoured, had put an end to ''hurricane amnesia.'' Prevention is certainly possible. Many experts say that an increase of only 5 percent to 8 percent in construction costs can give homes and other buildings a much greater chance of riding out such potent storms. Until now, the damage inflicted by hurricanes has generally been perceived as a strictly local wake-up call. In 1926, the ''Great Miami Hurricane'' shredded the fast-growing city and prompted the creation of the first significant building codes there. But the rest of Florida hardly noticed, said Herbert Saffir, 87, one of the deans of hurricane engineering and co-creator of the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew, an extraordinary Category 5 storm, killed 26 people and caused more than $20 billion in damage in a swath south of Miami. Again, only the two most-affected counties, Miami-Dade and Broward, greatly stiffened their codes and enforcement. They also established new standards for roofing, windows and other building products. Walls must resist a two-by-four shot from a cannon at 39 miles an hour. Still the rest of Florida lagged, Mr. Saffir said. It took nine years of tussling among developers and insurance companies and others following Hurricane Andrew before a statewide building code was enacted. This code, while a great improvement over the patchwork of 495 standards it replaced, is still far weaker than the one established by communities around Miami, Mr. Saffir and other engineers and hurricane experts say. ''Most of Florida has been consumed by complacency and has just not worried about hurricanes,'' Mr. Saffir said, in part because many decades have passed since most areas of the state have been struck head on. ''Maybe they won't ignore them now.'' Damage assessment experts who began to pick through the fresh destruction yesterday said the evidence was already clear from the strike zone of Hurricane Charley that better codes made a difference. Timothy P. Marshall, a damage inspector from Houston with degrees in structural engineering and meteorology, inspected the damage in eastern Florida yesterday, just three weeks after he toured the Gulf Coast cities of Port Charlotte and Punta Gorda and other communities swept by the preceding storm. In the wake of the first hurricane, he said, he saw many houses built to the 2001 code standing relatively unmarred next to the splintered wrecks of ones built a little earlier. ''If you just have one hurricane after another hitting Florida like seems to be happening this year, sooner or later every structure will be tested,'' Mr. Marshall said. Destruction can be separated from survival by decisions made at every scale when building a house, Mr. Marshall said, from the choice of nails used to attach roofing to rafters and plywood to rafters to the strength of the connections between the rafters and walls and finally the sturdiness of the attachments bonding the walls to the concrete slab in the ground. ''If you have a weak link, Mother Nature is going to exploit that and it's going to fail,'' he said. Some builders in Florida have attacked the problem not by a piecemeal upgrading of each component in a home, but instead by completely changing the way they design and assemble structures. Brian Bishop, a builder in Venice, near the path of Hurricane Charley, started a company, Home Front, that in three days -- with one team -- assembles 150 patented panels and other components into a house that is designed to withstand winds of up to 200 m.p.h. The panels and other components had been tested to Miami standards, but his houses had to wait until Aug. 13 to get their first baptism by hurricane. Three of them, built for the Homeless Coalition of Charlotte County, were directly in the path of Hurricane Charley. Foot-thick pine trees toppled all around one house, with one trunk bouncing off the steel-reinforced roof. A branch hurtled into the siding, sticking like a spear but not passing through. The house stood mostly undamaged. HURRICANE FRANCES: LOOKING AHEAD"
