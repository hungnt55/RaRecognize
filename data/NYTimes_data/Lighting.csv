"CAPTAIN STUBING wouldn't know thread counts from pillow tops. And Frette? That must be Charo's boyfriend. Cruise line cabins have come a long way since ''The Love Boat'' set sail for Acapulco back in the 70's, but now they are getting positively swank. In what the industry terms an ''extreme makeover,'' aging vessels are being refitted, refurbished and, in some cases, even reassembled, turning claustrophobic cabins into floating skyboxes that would make Ian Schrager proud. Balconies are being welded on, mattresses upgraded, fiber-optic lighting installed and goose-down pillows fluffed -- all in an effort to attract younger passengers accustomed to plasma televisions as well as entice repeat customers tired of the same floral duvet. ''Cabins used to be closeted, drab and uninspiring -- a lot like inexpensive roadside motels,'' said Glen Reid, a leisure analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York City. ''Today, they're looking a lot more like five-star resorts.'' And what resort would be complete without personalized stationery, a 24-hour concierge and a full-service spa? As part of a $225 million facelift, Holland America Line is adding those and a dozen other boutique-minded comforts to its 13-ship fleet. Clunky televisions are being replaced by flat-screen models; single-spray faucets are being upgraded to pulsating showerheads; and beds are being perked up with Sealy Posturepedic Euro-top mattresses. Thread counts are rising faster than gasoline prices. Holland America upgraded its 180-count, blended-cotton sheets to 250-count, all-cotton linen. Silversea Cruises upped the ante with 320-count, Egyptian cotton bedspreads. Not to be outdone, Crystal Cruises now boasts 350-count Frette linens in its penthouses, a pillow menu (hypoallergenic, foam, feather and neck-shaped) for its most discriminating sleepers. No detail is too small to be embellished. Bathrooms are not only being outfitted with full-body jets and whirlpool tubs, but they now feature chic toiletries like Acqua di Parma (Silversea), L'Occitaine (Norwegian Cruise Line) and Red Flower (Crystal). ''They carry it at Barneys,'' said Mimi Weisbrand, a spokeswoman for Crystal, which switched to Red Flower from Aveda. ''Each room will be stocked with two scents: blood orange and gardenia. We're the first to give passengers a choice of two scents.'' It's all part of the amenity creep popularized by style-conscious hotels and now engulfing the cruise industry in a tidal wave of designer chic. ''It's similar to what Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons feature in their suites,'' said Erling Frydenberg, the chief operations officer at Silversea. ''We want to stay competitive.'' But the decorating drive is also a matter of economics. New construction of cruise vessels has slowed in recent years, and cruise lines are focusing on modernizing older vessels. A striking example is the Royal Caribbean International's Enchantment of the Seas. Last year, the eight-year-old ship was cut in half and a 73-foot-long midsection was inserted like a drop leaf, adding 151 new staterooms and extending its length to 990 feet. Similarly, the company's older Sovereign of the Seas was recently retrofitted with 62 balconies to meet a growing consumer demand for outdoor accommodations. ''People have developed an expectation for private balconies, both on cruises and on land,'' said Adam M. Goldstein, the president of Royal Caribbean. The same upmarket drift applies to the décor. Gone are the days when cabins felt like hospital waiting rooms, characterized by beige metal walls, harsh overhead lighting and office-grade chairs that were often bolted to the deck. Las Vegas-style themes that were popular in the last decade (Polynesian tiki bars, African safari lounges, Parisian cafes) also seem to be on a wane. The emerging look today is more sophisticated and more residential. Walls are now sheathed in exotic wood veneers like eucalyptus. Chairs are upholstered in tanned leather and crushed velvet. And the lighting mixes low-voltage halogens, soffit-mounted diodes and custom-made table lamps. ''Our cabins went from traditional to contemporary,'' said Alexandra Don, the vice president of onboard guest services for Crystal, which replaced all the soft furnishings on the Crystal Symphony last year. Neutral-toned carpet was laid down, less-frilly curtains were hung and quilted duvets were spread. It was the second facelift in three years. ''Redesigns used to take place every four to five years,'' said Frank Symeou, the chief executive at designteam, a London firm that has worked with Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Cunard. ''Now it's every couple of years.'' That's not the only thing getting younger. While retirees are still a core segment of the cruise industry, the average age of passengers has fallen in the last decade to 50 from 60, according to the Cruise Line International Association in New York. The latest association survey shows that people under 40 now make up about a quarter of the manifest. In decorating terms, that means pastels, floral prints and pale woods are out; muted textures and darker woods are in. ''It's no longer just Grandma and Grandpa, but all ages,'' said Gunnar Aaserud, the executive architect at Yran & Storbraaten, an Oslo-based design firm that is modernizing the Silversea fleet. ''We're moving away from shiny brass, and more toward brushed stainless steel.'' That younger look is evident on the newest ships. The Norwegian Jewel, a Norwegian Cruise Line ship that entered service in September, was meant to evoke a stylish international hotel, with a dozen suites that feel like Gen-X bachelor pads. The 5,750-square-foot Garden Villa, for instance, has rosewood walls with stainless steel trim, a dark walnut wet bar with shiny aluminum stools, and a white circular couch that faces a 42-inch plasma television. The bathrooms are equipped with more flat-panel televisions, his-and-her bowl-like sinks, and sconces that resemble light sabers. The nightclub atmosphere is echoed throughout the ship. Passageways are lined with abstract art. Teak cabanas ring the swimming pools. And instead of marble and mirrors, the atrium has a Jumbotron-size monitor, a simulated skylight with stalactite-shaped crystals and Louis XVI-style chairs rendered in hot pink. ''The atrium was inspired by the minimalist Philippe Starck style,'' said Trevor Young, vice president for hotel, new building and refurbishment for Norwegian. The Whiskey Bar, with its bands of orange light and top-shelf liquor framed behind frosted yellow glass, borrows heavily from the Mandarin Bar in London. Hip hotel references are even finding their way into stately and more conservative ships like Cunard's Queen Mary 2. While much of the behemoth vessel is swathed in walnut burr and accessorized with silver butler trays, the Commodore Club could be mistaken for a Scandinavian airport lounge, the Veuve Clicquot Champagne Bar has the crisp elegance of a Hermès showroom, and its Canyon Ranch spa could be the focus of a Wallpaper centerfold. ''When we ask our clients what they want -- traditional, themed, contemporary or avant-garde -- very often they will mention hotels like the Delano in Miami,'' said Andy Collier, the head of design at SMC Design in London, which collaborated on the Queen Mary 2 and the Queen Elizabeth 2's recent renovation. ''They want that cool sophisticated look.'' But cutting-edge design has its limits in a travel sector where social activities are programmed to the minute, and predictability is prized over adventure. Cruises,after all, take the guesswork out of visiting foreign places, and appeal to the kind of mainstream tourist who probably prefers Ethan Allen over Herman Miller. ''As much as the industry is trying to broaden the demographic, they don't want to alienate the core customer by adopting avant-garde designs,'' said Robin Farley, a senior leisure analyst with UBS in San Francisco. ''It's still an older customer base.'' Cruise lines agree that their interiors won't end up in glossy magazines anytime soon. ''You can build a wonderful ship that wins all the design awards, but nobody will go on them,'' said Ms. Don, the Crystal vice president. ''Our demographic doesn't want a bathroom wall made of glass. They don't want to watch their 78-year-old wife taking a shower.'' SUMMER CRUISES: DESIGN TRENDS"
"Q. I'd like to replace the ugly light fixtures in my bathroom. Is there anything I need to know? A. Bathroom lighting is tricky: we've all stared in the mirror of a host's powder room and thought, ''Am I really this pale?'' That's usually because the light is too yellow or too blue, a problem that can be remedied with full-spectrum or other color-balanced bulbs. I like to use such bulbs in sconces flanking the mirror, adding ambient light from a ceiling fixture or two. Incandescent bulbs are made by Chromalux and by Sylvania, whose Decor/Vanity line also has compact fluorescent bulbs, either full spectrum or ''daylight balanced.'' You can usually get away with any type of lighting fixture in a bathroom, certainly if it has a window and good air circulation. But if it's small and the mirrors steam up, or if you want a light and a ventilation fan over the shower, it will be necessary to cut a hole in the ceiling and another in the roof or an external wall to vent the moist air outside. Any fixture for a bathroom should be certified for ''damp locations'' by Underwriters Laboratories. Damp means just that: moisture is in the air. Where water is actually splashed around, you must go one step further and get fixtures certified for wet locations. These can go above or near a shower or tub (but not in a hot tub or swimming pool, which require an even higher degree of waterproof). Many wet-location fixtures were originally designed for covered patios and garages, so styling can be a problem; picture nautical themes and protective wire cages at home on the deck of the Titanic. But Broan-NuTone, of Hartford, Wis., has just released two attractive wet-location fixtures, each recessed and combining a light and a ventilation fan. Such fans require ductwork; a contractor can tell you whether this can be done. (In New York apartments, usually not.) Model 744, shown above in a row appropriate for an especially large bathroom, has an incandescent bulb and is about $128 at Home Depot and Lowe's. Model 744FL, about $178, has a fluorescent bulb and can be ordered. Information and store locations: broan.com or (800) 558-1711. Ventilation fans vary in how much air they move and how noisy they are. Broan and NuTone have new Ultra Silent lines, certified for wet locations, that a spokeswoman says have been certified by the Home Ventilation Institute as the quietest available. (Noise is often measured in sones, which permits comparison shopping. Four sones is noisy; 0.3 sone is quiet.) Prices start at $168. In May Broan-NuTone plans to release a $400 version, also requiring vent ductwork, with a sensor that turns the fan on and off automatically as humidity rises and falls. Store locations: nutone.com; information: (888) 336-3948. The Hunter Fan Company, in Memphis, has an ornate ventilation fan and light combination called the Orleans, inset. The fixture, which costs $98, has a glass dome and is suitable for damp locations, though it too requires venting to the outside. Store locations: hunterfan.com or (800) 448-6837. Room to Improve"
"Q. I am fascinated by the ever-changing multicolored lighting on top of the Empire State Building. Could you tell me the schedule? A. Only the highlights. Most gazers probably don't realize how often the lighting system changes and how many groups, causes, nations and holidays are honored. The building's Web site, www.esbnyc.com, lists 67 combinations of up to three colors that have been used. (Examples of color schemes and the subjects they have celebrated can be found atop the pages of this section.) The possibilities are seemingly endless. For example, as one reads the colors from the bottom up, as a pedestrian would see them, lavender-lavender-white honors the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. Yellow has celebrated the U.S. Open tennis tournament, among other topics. Purple-purple-gold honored the golden jubilee day of Queen Elizabeth II. Just looking up won't tell you everything. Are you looking at red-blue-white? You could be seeing a commemoration of Philippine independence or the colors of the New York Rangers. Blue -- just blue -- has been used to commemorate more than a dozen subjects, including Unicef, Boys and Girls Clubs, child abuse prevention and Jazz at Lincoln Center. If you want to light the building pink for Mom's birthday, sorry. Building policy does not allow lighting for commercial or corporate events, or personal celebrations, though requests are taken for nonprofit or charitable celebrations. To avoid the risk to birds, which are attracted to the lights, the tower lights are turned off during spring and fall migration seasons and on some cloudy, humid or foggy nights, when large numbers of birds are seen flying near the building. The Empire State Building has been lighted to some degree since November 1932, when a searchlight beacon alerted the public to Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as president. Colored lighting came in 1976. Installed in each of the four faces of the topmost mast are four vertical banks of 11 eight-foot panels positioned one on top of another, for a total of 176 panels. A ring of 32 sodium vapor lights above the 102nd floor was installed in 1984 to create a golden halo effect around the top of the mast from dusk to dawn. Q. When I was on the Empire State Building's observation deck, I got to wondering why the building stopped where it did. I've read that buildings could have been built much higher. A. It's true; buildings could have gone higher. In 1956, Frank Lloyd Wright even sketched a design for a mile-high 528-story skyscraper in Illinois. But the Empire State Building, to say nothing of Wright's behemoth, was limited by economic factors. As a building rises higher, more structural steel and bracing are required, lowering the amount of rentable space and increasing costs. While the Empire State Building was being planned, the American Institute of Steel Construction issued a report estimating that a skyscraper's rate of economic return declined if it went higher than 63 stories. But perhaps the major factor limiting height was the elevators. As floors went higher, more passengers had to be served and the elevator cables were longer. Wider shafts were needed, reducing rentable space. Balancing speed with comfort is a juggling act. The acceleration of elevators has to be tolerable for riders' knees and stomachs. The Empire State elevators travel as fast as 1,000 feet a minute. For the record, the Empire State Building stands 1,250 feet tall. A broadcasting antenna adds 204 feet to the overall height, making it 1,454 feet. An earlier antenna, which stood from 1951 to 1984, was 18 feet taller. MICHAEL POLLAK F. Y. I.

"At night, an iPod makes good company. With the Blinkit from Intuitive Devices, it becomes a low-wattage guardian angel, too. The Blinkit, which plugs into any iPod with a dock connector, can be used as a flashlight to throw light on the trail ahead or as a safety flasher with beams that can be split and directed forward and back, or left and right. Pressing its power button cycles it through five different programmed flash patterns, as well as a mode that makes it flash to the beat of the music being played. A set of transparent caps for changing the beam color is included in the $30 price. Blinkit is available from Apple stores or at www.blinkitnow.com. Using a pair of light-emitting diodes as its light source, the Blinkit draws only 100 milliwatts of power in flashlight mode and about 12 milliwatts while flashing. (It wouldn't be a guardian angel if it drained your batteries.) IVAN BERGER CIRCUITS"
"I'VE tried to be responsible. I've thought pro-green thoughts and occasionally even done pro-green things. I've run the dishwasher and washer-dryer only with full loads. I've recycled, as ordered, though like every New Yorker I've ever met, I suspect the system does more good for our feelings than for the environment. I've shaved while showering, although I can't remember anymore whether that's a good or a bad thing. I've been too busy to do much more, though, and too confused and overwhelmed by all the eco hype out there, and too inflexible to seriously change my lifestyle. No way am I hanging clothes out to dry on a clothesline. I won't drive more slowly -- as President Bush, like past presidents, has urged Americans to do to save gas -- and neither will you, and neither will anyone. And I recently bought a flat-screen high-def 37-inch TV, an energy-Hoover you'll have to pry from my cold, dead hands; if you haven't seen an N.F.L. game on something like that, my friend, you might as well watch curling. But the morning after I saw Al Gore's ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' I was spurred to action. I bought 50 compact fluorescent light bulbs -- 50 -- intent on replacing every incandescent one in my home. The new bulbs were supposed to be 67 percent more efficient and last up to 15 times longer. Unfortunately, the ones I bought also cast a considerably colder light, so I aborted my plan after just two bulbs when I realized the quality of light they emitted reminded me of a bus station bathroom. In the weeks since, I dispatched the six cartons of unused C.F.L.'s to the basement, and my guilt grew alarmingly. As the father of three very young children, I had to do something -- but something I would actually follow through with, something that would take minimal effort. Then, two weeks ago, while eating a doughnut and watching the scintillatingly clear images of Mets and Yankees scampering across my TV screen, I saw what I needed to do. Flipping channels, I came across the news that Bill Clinton's Global Initiative had just ended with Richard Branson, the British mogul, pledging $3 billion to fight climate change over the next decade. On another channel, Mayor Bloomberg stood at a podium in California and announced, to my pride and delight, his sweeping eco-initiative for New York: the city's carbon emissions would be measured, an Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability would be created. Meanwhile, the man standing next to him, Governor Schwarzenegger, was set to sign legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for his state -- the world's 12th largest contributor of such gases -- at a level the federal government had continually rejected. Everyone was chipping in, even Arnold, the first civilian ever to drive a Hummer. I took another bite of doughnut. And that's when it came to me. I should go on a diet. A half-ton diet. I knew, having taken the ''Calculate Your Impact'' survey on climatecrisis.net, the companion Web site for the Gore movie, that our household produced some 19,100 pounds of CO2 last year, 4,100 pounds more than the national average. (The concept of a ''pound'' of gas is a nebulous one -- depending on the pressure and temperature, it can fill a thimble or a stadium -- so maybe it's best portrayed this way: one pound of CO2 is what's released per each mile driven, or each mile flown per person; it's what's produced to heat five gallons of water.) For easier math, I rounded my number to 20,000 pounds, or 10 tons. As a family, as a household, couldn't we drop a half-ton, a mere 5 percent of our weight? That's 10 pounds for a 200-pounder to lose, 6 for a 120-pounder. Absolutely. It was a goal, one I could stick to. Ambitious as it sounded, it was, amazingly, not excessive. I could keep living generally the way I wanted. I gave myself eight hours, no more, to lose the weight. In a world where texting passes for conversation and hooking up for a relationship, perhaps I'd just defined the new activism. Very little pain, not insignificant gain. Mindy Pennybacker, the editor of The Green Guide and thegreenguide.com, was also enthusiastic about my plan. ''Americans have too much weight in many ways, so it's a metaphor that makes sense,'' she said when I called her. ''If it motivates you because it's familiar and part of your everyday life, that's terrific.'' ''It's all about attitude,'' said Laurie David, the founder of the Stop Global Warming Web site (stopglobalwarming.org) and a board member of the National Resources Defense Council. ''Change one or two things, you end up changing four or five things. You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Before you know it, you start influencing people around you.'' Like most dieters, I cut deals with myself. If you're trying to lose real weight, you vow, say, to give up beer and ice cream but retain your pizza rights. Since I was trying to emit less CO2, I vowed to lower the thermostat at night by one degree -- not two, as often recommended by tree-huggers -- a tweak I expected none of us would notice. (That saved 79 pounds; each degree equals approximately 315 pounds of CO2; turning it down only at night, for the six colder months, or 1/4 times 315). In return? No more guilt over TV size. Friends I called for suggestions understood my deal-making. Judy said she never used electrical kitchen appliances -- ''Opening a can is something I'm able to do'' -- but was still not ready to swap Vaseline for non-petroleum eye-makeup remover. Victoria said she saw a young mother with her baby in some sort of recycled paper diaper that did not look at all absorbent. ''My baby is wearing Pampers, probably one of the most wasteful things I do,'' she said. Then again, as much as she loves S.U.V.'s -- the way they feel and handle -- she and her husband realized that if they bought one they would be ostracized by half their circle. They bought a station wagon that gets three times the mileage. I vowed to quit my profligate morning habit of turning on the shower and leaving the bathroom, not returning until several minutes after the water was hot. On the flip side, once I stepped into the shower I was not going to turn the experience into a 60-second spasm of sudsing and rinsing. Two minutes shower going unnecessarily times 2.5 gallons per minute times 365 morning showers times three ounces of CO2 produced per gallon of hot water equals 342 pounds. (My calculations, here and elsewhere, were made with the help of experts at the National Resources Defense Council and The Green Guide, several credible Web sites and a few smart relatives who grew up to be physicists and engineers.) When washing white loads, I'd switch from the warm/warm cycle to warm/cold, comfortable that neither I nor my wife would notice the difference. (We didn't.) Sixty-two pounds saved. Four hundred and eighty-three total pounds, 30 seconds of effort to reprogram the thermostat, two no-brainer decisions. Maybe my diet was riddled with compromises, but it was working. I found further validation for my lack of rigor. ''When people equate efficiency with discomfort and sacrifice -- like when Jimmy Carter put on a sweater and encouraged Americans to lower the thermostat -- they shy away from it,'' said Bill Prindle, the deputy director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ''A month later they're back to their old ways. We need to ask people to act from their values'' -- meaning fundamentals like ''physical security, clothing, food and shelter, including thermal comfort.'' I felt certain I could unearth more savings in what Danny Seo, an eco-expert with a TV show, a Sirius radio show and a series of books all titled ''Simply Green,'' described to me as ''bad habits we don't even realize are bad habits.'' For example, was it really energy-wiser, as I'd often heard, to leave a light or computer on for the few minutes you're out of the room, rather turning it off and then on again? ''Total myth,'' Mr. Prindle said. ''Actually, I think that's a projection. Because it takes me more work to shut it off, people think, then it must generally require more energy. It's like the better-to-leave-the-car-idlingtheory.'' There were other bad habits that were just as easy to break. A friend suggested this quickie: Call retailers to get them to stop sending the print catalogs to which our house had become addicted. I chose 10 -- L. L. Bean, Crate & Barrel, J. Crew, Eddie Bauer, Garnet Hill, Design Within Reach, Lands' End, Restoration Hardware, Hammacher Schlemmer and the Company Store. (Originally I'd included Williams-Sonoma, but my wife vetoed that idea.) It took me 22 minutes total to cancel them -- eight phone calls and two e-mails. Ninety (the average number of pages) times 12 (number of issues per year we seem to get) times 10 (retailers) equals 10,800 pages. Since my research shows that one tree produces about 25,000 pages of the coated, lower-end virgin paper used in most catalogs, I'd just saved 43 percent of one tree. One tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen, 43 percent of that is 112 pounds, which converts to 154 pounds of CO2 saved. Everyone but me seemed to know about ''vampires'' -- those energy suckers plugged into the wall when not in use (toasters, coffeemakers, hair dryers, cellphone chargers), consuming energy in standby mode. The easiest solution? Pull out individual plugs or, particularly for areas near computers and home entertainment equipment with lots of components, plug everything into a power strip (with surge protector) and, when done for the night or weekend, flip off the illuminated switch. Doing that would save me about 115 pounds annually on the computer, about 200 pounds on the TV, DVD and VCR. (Cable and satellite boxes draw huge amounts of energy, but turning them off may result in considerable reboot delays. I'm not going to turn mine off every night, but I might when I go on vacation.) My boys and I drove to Lowe's for surge protectors as well as a thermal insulating blanket for our 75-gallon hot-water heater; wrapping it, every expert I spoke with told me, significantly reduces the massive heat loss, especially in winter. (Newer water heaters tend to have higher levels of insulation built in.) The largest blanket they carried, though, was for a 60-gallon tank, and a check of their Web site (and, later, of the Home Depot's) also showed no blanket for a tank our size. Forget it, then; this was the lazy man's diet, minimum effort. On our way to the cashier, we passed an aisle with motion sensors, and I remembered my brother had them in his bathrooms, where they shut off the lights soon after people left. They seemed an easy enough item to buy and install. I called my brother, Marc. ''Be honest,'' I said. ''Will there be re-wiring?'' My brother, an astrophysicist, said no, there wouldn't be; then something to the effect that, unless I was too stupid to remove a light switch plate and put another one on, I was fully capable. ''Wait,'' I said. ''Why does anyone need a motion sensor in their bathroom? Don't people turn the light on when they go in and turn it off when they leave?'' ''Ah,'' he said. ''You don't have teenagers yet.'' Scratch the motion sensors, at least for six more years. I was now up to 952 pounds, more than 90 percent of the way to my goal. Okay; I was ready to turn back to the C.F.L.'s. I decided I could tolerate the cool white ones in two places only: our outside vestibule (60 watts replaced with 13 watts, with the same number of lumens, or brightness), and one overhead fixture in my office (75 watts replaced with 19), where its effect was neutralized by incandescent track lighting. They were lights that were on much more often than most. Together, they would save me, annually, about 300 pounds in 20 minutes, including shopping time. Three hundred pounds. No typo. Two bulbs. I wasn't done, though -- soon but not yet. I learned from Laurie David of Stop Global Warming that it makes almost no sense to rinse dishes in very hot water when they're just going into a dishwasher to be rinsed in even hotter water. I would hereby skip that step, plus I'd also hand-wash dirty dishes created after 10 o'clock (no real chore since I find it relaxing). Should buy us two loads weekly, down to four instead of six -- or 200 pounds saved for the year. And I would have to give up my screensaver habit, much as I loved images of my children floating across my line of sight while I thought up sentences. In screensaver mode, my computer still draws a lot of power, according to David Goldstein, the energy program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. He advised that by changing my settings so that computer and display both go to sleep when inactive for 10 minutes (as opposed to my original setting of three hours), I would save about 250 pounds annually. It took me 30 seconds to click on the Apple icon, then ''System Preferences,'' then ''Energy Saver.'' Seventeen hundred pounds dropped in 68 minutes -- a little more than one of the eight hours I'd allowed for. All that would be required of me in the future was 10 seconds nightly to shut off two power strip switches and five to 10 minutes, every now and then, of pleasant dishwashing. I ought to be done with it now -- even if my numbers were a bit off, I'd blown past my goal, after all, a dangerous thing to do early on with a diet. But maybe Ms. David is right: make one change, soon you're ready to make three. Maybe one day soon I'll be ready to change a whole floor's worth of light bulbs; I learned after buying my 50 bulbs that it's possible to find C.F.L.'s that cast a warm glow, and the Green Guide's helpful light bulb product report suggests that C.F.L.'s have been improving. Danny Seo says that Ikea carries lighting fixtures that handsomely mask the shortcomings of C.F.L.'s, with tinted glass or a strip of wood veneer. Maybe we'll replace a roll or six of virgin toilet paper with post-consumer waste napkins -- maybe. This is all I'm willing to do right now. Don't look for me to carpool at elevators. Then again, I can't help but wonder how much I might accomplish if I actually put in more effort than a garden slug. I'm intrigued by what a friend, an architect, told me: That if just one teensy change were made to New York City -- if all black roofs were painted white or silver, a simple, surprisingly inexpensive fix -- the financial and energy savings would be jaw-dropping, not to mention that it would severely reduce the possibility of blackouts and brownouts. Relatively meager effort, monster bang for the buck. So, like, I don't know, maybe some weekend soon we all just get brushes and roof paint, fan out across the city, and just do it and get it over with? And afterward everyone comes by my place to watch the World Series on my big old flat-screen?

"Do: Use dimmers. They provide intimacy and more flattering light at little cost. Lutron's Attaché is a winner, $15. At CL Lighting. Call (212)219-8076. Combine three types of lighting: ambient or background (for overall, even illumination); focused spotlighting (to shed light on each table or on specific objects); accent or mood (candles, for example). Integrate lighting into the architecture, which avoids drawing attention to the light itself. In the lounge of his New York restaurant, _pizz, John LaFemina hid rope lighting behind the ceiling's beams to achieve a glowing plane of ambient brightness. Vary light sources and heights. Robin Standefer, of Roman and Williams (the designers of the Standard Hotel and Restaurant, New York), says, ''Even in a room with a large central hanging fixture, it's important to include low lights -- such as sconces, candlelight and lamps -- to achieve a sense of layering.'' Space out your light. ''If you think your room could be lit by one 100-watt bulb,'' LaFemina says, ''it's better to get four lamps with 25-watt bulbs spaced evenly around the room.'' Account for daytime and evening lighting. At night, ''soft up-lighting hidden behind furniture is a solution, and glowing objects should also be used,'' says the French lighting guru Hervé Descottes (who lighted Beige, Tokyo). Consider experimenting with L.E.D. sources. According to the architect Peter Bentel of Bentel and Bentel (the firm that designed the Modern, in New York), these are rapidly improving in brightness and color accuracy. And ''they use so little energy that their use should be mandatory.'' Don't: Be trigger-happy with the dimmer. Too dim will give you a ''sleepy mood that lacks focus,'' cautions Bentel, who likes to blend incandescent sources with more color-accurate bulbs like halogen and xenon. Tolerate glare. One surefire solution, says David Tang (the owner and designer of China Tang, London): ''No light bulbs should ever be naked to the eye.'' ''Do anything that is too tricked-out or overdone,'' Standefer warns. Instead, she says, ''a big, heavy candle on its own is incredibly beautiful.'' Rely on candles alone. They can generate unflattering shadows, especially when placed below face level. Find a tall candle that sends light downward. Make all of the lampshades in the room the same color. Feature too much red or blue light, which has a flattening effect. Use fluorescent bulbs. Ever. Or, if you must, soften them with color gels. If you like the institutional look of fluorescent fixtures, take a hint from Schiller's Liquor Bar and install tubular incandescent bulbs instead. Tricks of the Trade: Colored bulbs: warm tones are more flattering, while cooler colors raise the drama level. (Want romance? Go for low-wattage pink bulbs.) The true white light emitted by halogen and xenon bulbs shows skin tone and food most correctly. To highlight a surface or an object, push a wash of clean, white light at your target; low-voltage halogen sources (MR16 bulbs are best) hidden in the ceiling will get the job done. Black chandeliers can actually light up a room. In Kate Hudson's dining room, Roman and Williams hung a dark Murano glass fixture from a ceiling covered in copper foil wallpaper so that light reflects off the metallic surface onto diners. Light from mismatched vintage sconces also bounces off the copper, and the chandelier's black crystal mirrors the table's candlelight. Putting traditional chandeliers in contemporary spaces or Modernist fixtures in old-fashioned dining rooms can change the mood dramatically. Wine lighting: at Craft, the Bentels used fiber-optic lighting in the wine rack because it doesn't produce heat or ultraviolet rays (known to break down the vino). Keeping soft light close to the body will beautify; again, look to the sconce, because side lighting is best. Finally, take a cue from Greta Garbo or Chéri's love, Léa, who knew that pink shades do more than make a vie en rose -- they promote prettiness.

"WHEN the dance beat dies and the stragglers disperse, Tom Whitman heads to the hills above the Sunset Strip for a little peace. An event planner catering to Hollywood's gay community, he stages 200 or so parties a year, including Wonderland, the largest of the city's Gay Pride events, which will be held Saturday on Paramount Studios' back lot. A party boy needs a place to unwind. So three or four nights a week, well after 1 a.m., he drives his silver Porsche convertible up the twisting back roads of Silver Lake, the once rough-at-the-edges neighborhood now populated by hipsters and musicians, to a 1921 Spanish bungalow he renovated last year as his refuge from all things rowdy and raucous. ''My job means being around thousands of people talking and dancing and having fun,'' Mr. Whitman said. ''When I come home I want to simplify my life.'' The house is designed for calm, starting with the black slate steppingstones that meander across his abbreviated thatch of lawn and the pocket-size rock garden with beach pebbles and a trickling water basin that manages to feel authentically Asian. The bungalow inside is simple, verging on austere, with little deviation from dark-stained wood, white walls and stainless steel. Mr. Whitman, 35, who bought the house two years ago for $600,000, outlawed any carpets or color. ''I never wanted it to be a crazy, vibrant place,'' he said last month in a tour of the place, which he moved into in September. ''I don't think that's relaxing.'' He added: ''It may be a gay man's house, but it's masculine. It's not fussy.'' The only decorations are a series of Mr. Whitman's sepia-tone photographs of far-flung spots like the Hagia Sofia in Istanbul and a Roman fountain by Bernini. The pictures reflect Mr. Whitman's itinerant upbringing; his father was an Air Force colonel, and the family moved every two or three years around Europe and America. The bungalow is the first residence he has owned, and he said he sees it as his first real home. ''Home was always where my parents were,'' he said. ''This is my first opportunity to translate the idea of home into a physical place.'' Mr. Whitman's architect, Michael Neumayr, also lives in Silver Lake, about a mile away in a renovated cottage he shares with his wife, Pia DeLeon, a lighting consultant whose clients include Brad Pitt and Kanye West. She is also an owner of Plug Lighting (pluglighting.com), a West Hollywood store regarded by California designers as the West Coast's pre-eminent source of modernist lighting. When Mr. Neumayr, who grew up in a remote part of Austria, settled in Silver Lake two years ago with Ms. DeLeon, he was unaware that the neighborhood was a showcase of Austrian design. R. M. Schindler and Richard Neutra, the Austrian masters of modernism, moved to Los Angeles in the 1920's after working for Frank Lloyd Wright in Wisconsin and Illinois, and built a disproportionate number of homes in Silver Lake, in part because their spare, progressive designs appealed to the movie industry's creative community, which was then concentrated there. Like his countrymen, Mr. Neumayr has found that Austrian modernism translates well to Southern California. He brought a Neutra-like modernist rigor to Mr. Whitman's bungalow, most evident in the kitchen, which has black lacquer cabinets and a 14-foot-long island with a black slate countertop. ''I'm not into manufactured materials,'' Mr. Neumayr said. ''I like the beauty of humble natural materials like wood, metal, glass and stone, the materials you can find in any old Austrian farmhouse.'' Oddly enough, Mr. Neumayr also brought a taste for Asian tradition. At first a skeptic, he began experimenting with feng shui while renting part of a 12th-century castle outside Munich, and came to believe in its benefits. At Mr. Whitman's house, feng shui influenced the placement of the path and fountain at the entrance (''the East is considered the direction of wealth'') and the careful symmetry of the floor plan (''you should feel like it's calm and balanced''). Feng shui also encouraged Mr. Neumayr to position the Bosch range in the cooking island so that Mr. Whitman faces guests while frying steaks or stirring soup. ''It's much better if you can look at people and talk to them while you're cooking rather than face a cubicle,'' Mr. Neumayr said. As a painter and a director of two animated short films, Mr. Whitman brought his own visual acuity to the renovation; the men say they pushed each other, particularly in the detailing. The master bathroom, for example, attained a level of refinement neither would have achieved on his own, with its painstakingly assembled oak wood floors, frosted glass, stainless steel and slate. A custom-designed black concrete sink and vanity stand in front of a mirrored wall with an integrated medicine cabinet. The materials seamlessly flow into one another without a single lip or overlap. ''It was the hardest thing I've ever done,'' Mr. Neumayr said. They chose to keep much of the front of the house, including its original white stucco facade, either intact or close to its original condition, and added white doors. The house grows more modern and the palette turns darker as you walk to the back where three French doors open onto a yard with views of the Hollywood sign and seating of poured concrete and ipe, a durable hardwood from South America, built around a fire pit made of Balinese lava stone. Their collaborative push for refinement was not without its costs: the renovation budget tripled to $300,000. Their only point of contention was the refrigerator. Mr. Neumayr advocated a compact version fashionable in Europe, in part because it would integrate neatly into the kitchen. ''But I'm an American,'' Mr. Whitman said, ''and I wanted a big American refrigerator.'' They settled on a Frigidaire big enough for Mr. Whitman's ample supplies of Corona, wine and leftovers from Sunday afternoon barbecues. By Mr. Neumayr's description, the completed house is mostly about its lighting. ''It's very theatrical,'' he said, ''without being Las Vegas.'' Of course, he may say that because Ms. DeLeon provided the lighting, choosing luminous hanging sculptures that glow against the subdued furnishings and white walls. ''Before now I'd always thought of lighting as an afterthought,'' Mr. Whitman said. ''Pia taught me that the drama of a room comes from its lighting.'' In the master bedroom, for example, matching Drop pendants made of blown glass with halogen bulbs by Heinrich Fiedeler and Michael Raasch add a subtle industrial touch. Over the dining table hangs Clara, a pendant designed by Mr. Neumayr with dark wood and lampshades. (The couple met when Ms. DeLeon stopped to admire his design for the Clara lamp at a lighting show in 1999.) ''I wanted Tom's house to be lit in such a way that when he's entertaining, it's very sexy and diaphanous,'' she said. ''It was important that the lighting be unobtrusive, so you noticed only the light, not the fixture. I wanted there to be a tactile feel to the light.'' At night the house glows like a lantern as Mr. Whitman passes the Coronas and turns up the fire pit. ''For me, hanging out with friends doesn't mean going to a bar,'' he said. ''Because of my job, it's the last thing I want to do. It's nice to be away from all that. It's nice to be here.'' Design Notebook"
"FRAN_OIS JOUSSE paced along the south roof of Notre-Dame, chain-smoking French cigarillos as he waited for darkness to fall. Suddenly, the southern facade of the cathedral lit up, its pillars, gargoyles and flying buttresses adorned in white. ''Ah, this gives me such great pleasure!'' he said, warming his hands in one of the spotlight canisters. ''I truly am blessed with the most splendid job.'' Indeed, Mr. Jousse, a 64-year-old engineer, is the troubleshooter for the City of Light. As chief engineer for doctrine, expertise and technical control, he is responsible for lighting 300 of the monuments, official buildings, bridges and boulevards of the French capital. Working with a staff of 30 decorative lighting specialists at a City Hall annex, Mr. Jousse helps create new lighting projects, lectures experts, negotiates with powerful players like the Roman Catholic Church and resolves technical problems at sites throughout the city. One recent evening, Mr. Jousse was summoned urgently to an alleyway filled with garbage in a gritty neighborhood in the 19th Arrondissement. He had tried to mount a projector to shine one of his creations -- images of six decorative windows he had photographed -- onto a bare concrete wall there. One was half-opened, with a red drape; another showed the silhouette of a black cat from an iconic late 19th-century poster. But the images needed to be enlarged to match the real windows nearby. The deputy mayor of the neighborhood wanted the wall ready for Christmas. After a struggle to mount a different lens, he settled on a temporary compromise: the windows were enlarged, but two of them had to go because the existing lens could accommodate only four of that size. ''Oh, no, we can't lose the cat!'' he said. ''It's back to the lab.'' MR. JOUSSE became one of the world's foremost urban lighting experts by accident. A native of Paris, he landed a job in 1963 with the city's engineering division after graduating from college, helping widen and deepen the city's canals. He later had jobs supervising 3,000 garbage collectors and creating pedestrian streets. In 1981, a supervisor asked him to change course once again. ''He wanted someone who would not be caught up in daily work and could think about light,'' Mr. Jousse said. ''I knew a little bit about electricity, and I was an amateur photographer. So he invented a job for me.'' At the time, most of the Paris monuments were either unlighted or only crudely illuminated with big spotlights that shone directly onto the facades. Mr. Jousse sought out urban architects and theatrical lighting experts for ideas and technical training. He eventually created a research laboratory for the city of Paris, where he and a team began to create fixtures and to experiment with the color and intensity of light. The city now spends about $260,000 a day on its lighting. But that does not mean everything runs smoothly. The $2.1 million project to redesign the lighting of Notre-Dame -- most recently the lighting of the south facade, which was inaugurated last week -- has involved heartbreaking compromises. For half a century, the only hint of light on the south facade came from spotlights on the far side of the Seine River. The new lighting scheme was intended to allow spectators to discover the cathedral's facade slowly, through the power and drama of the details. But as a national monument, Notre-Dame belongs to the French state, which has the right to veto any design decision. Stones could not be moved, walls could not be drilled. All material and equipment had to be moved in and out of Notre-Dame at night to avoid annoying tourists. A bigger headache came from the Catholic clergy. The designers had planned to light the facade's rose window from within, so that it could be seen in full color by passers-by. The priests called the idea sacrilegious. ''They said we wanted to perturb the faithful,'' Mr. Jousse said. ''They accused us of trying to turn Notre-Dame into Disneyland.'' Then, just days before the inauguration of the new lighting of the south facade, Mr. Jousse realized it was marred by what he called ''holes of blackness.'' The solution came to him on a trip to the annual lighting festival in Lyon. Lyon has its own school of lighting, a pointillist approach that uses small spotlights to highlight the details of its Baroque architecture for dramatic effect. The Paris school, by contrast, takes a holistic approach that bathes structures in warm, even light. Urgent consultations followed. Until late into the night before the inauguration, electricians were busy bolting in makeshift light fixtures. ''Now, the light is stronger at the top, so that you feel that you are moving closer to heaven,'' he said. MR. JOUSSE certainly does not have the look of a senior City Hall bureaucrat. He keeps his gray and yellow beard long and bushy. He does not remember the last time he wore a tie. He prefers to drink a dark French beer with his workers than to sip fine wine at City Hall soirees. Tooling around town in a small, white Renault sedan with a special plate in the windshield, he parks wherever he wants -- even on the cobblestone walkway at Notre-Dame and on the quay in front of the Musée d'Orsay. He rattles off details about lighting history: how the adorning of Paris in light began in the 14th century when Philip V the Tall ordered candles to be lighted in three sites every night, how the Paris lamppost was invented in the 18th century, how one way Paris earned the nickname City of Light was from the artificial electrical light displays at the Paris Fair of 1900. He recalls the time a few years back when he and a team were experimenting with light on Sacré Coeur Basilica in Montmartre and colored it mauve. ''The priest came running out and ordered us to turn it off,'' Mr. Jousse said. ''We just wanted to have some fun. But Paris is a very serious city.'' The 20,000 flashing lights of the Eiffel Tower (they dazzle for 10 minutes every hour on the hour until after 1 a.m.) are, for him, ''a visual clock, like the bell of a church -- every hour the light sounds the hour.'' He shrieked when he saw for the first time that the Grand Palais, which belongs to the state, not the city, had been lighted up in bright blue-green. He stopped the car, pulled a camera and tripod out of the trunk and started taking pictures. ''I hope it's only for Christmas!'' he said. ''It's so Las Vegas!'' By contrast, he shows off the lighting of the Petit Palais, which belongs to Paris, just across the street. Its spotlights have been hidden in the tops of the streetlamps. He attracted pedestrians to the ominously dark sidewalk along the Boulevard de Bercy under the A4 highway, lighting it in bright blue. Mr. Jousse's goal is to steep the city's structures in history and integrate them into their surroundings rather than to treat them as individual jewels that should be showcased. ''The secrets are very simple,'' he said. ''Blend light with the surroundings. Don't annoy the birds, the insects, the neighbors or the astronomers. If City Hall gave me money to do whatever I want, I'd teach people about the beauty of light. I'd make Parisians the owners of their light.'' THE SATURDAY PROFILE"
"AT dusk on Nov. 25, the lights started to dance to the music at the twin row houses of Robert DeLauro and Frank Cianflone in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. They blinked and shimmered, their colors fading in and out, as the homes -- linked with a Christmas tree made of lights hovering over a common driveway -- were outlined first in red lights, then green. Candy canes and a ''Happy Holidays'' banner of lights blinked in time to Frank Sinatra crooning ''Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,'' and a nativity scene on the Cianflones' lawn glowed and then dimmed, alternating with spotlights on Santa's sleigh and a snowman at the DeLauros'. Passersby could also hear Jiminy Cricket singing ''Very Merry Christmas'' from an outdoor speaker, or double-park and listen by tuning in with their car radios, drive-in-theater style, to 88.7 FM. Mr. DeLauro, who decorates both his home and that of the Cianflones, his in-laws, next door, is one of a growing number of Christmas enthusiasts who are using computerized displays of synchronized lighting and sound to produce a kind of musical extravaganza, pushing the ever-mounting stakes in the competitive sport of decking the halls. Until 1999, there were fewer than 100 such lighting animation hobbyists, according to Chuck Smith, the founder of planetchristmas.com, a Web site where Christmas display buffs have gathered for the past 10 years. But in 2000, with the advent of early-generation software and hardware that allowed people to create elaborately choreographed Christmas decorations, ''the genie was let out of the bottle,'' he said. (Mr. Smith, an electrical engineer from Franklin, Tenn., who calls himself a ''super-nerd,'' claims to have created the first computerized Christmas display, in 1984.) Computerized displays enjoyed a huge increase in visibility last year, when an Ohio man's painstakingly choreographed light show became an Internet sensation, and was picked up for a Miller Lite commercial. In just the last year, Mr. Smith said, the Planet Christmas community has more than doubled, from 1,700 members to 4,000. Until three years ago, Mr. DeLauro's lights merely twinkled in a static display of Christmas cheer. At the urging of his two teenage daughters, he searched the Internet for technology that would allow him to pipe in music to accompany the display. He found Light-O-Rama software and a microprocessor-based Light-O-Rama controller box with 16 programmable channels, which he wired to a computer in his basement. Then he connected his 10,000 lights to the controller using 32 extension cords. ''I spend all summer planning it out on my computer,'' said Mr. DeLauro, 46, a funeral supply business manager who holds a Christmas-in-August barbecue every year to test his lights. He listens to Christmas songs all year long, programming the lights to flicker to the beats. He found an empty frequency that lets him broadcast the show over the radio for about 25 feet on each side of his house using a small FM transmitter. Mr. DeLauro posted his home on Planet Christmas, where the chat boards buzz 365 days a year about the latest decorating trends, from larger-than-life inflatables to light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.s, that don't have filaments that burn out and that consume very little electricity. There is much discussion, too, of the fact that attention-grabbing computerized displays -- usually thought of as power-hogging -- actually save energy. ''Your consumption goes down by 90 percent or more, mainly because the lights aren't all on at the same time,'' said Mr. Smith, who has closely monitored his holiday electricity use for 20 years. Even so, the number of lights on at any one time can be staggering. Marty Slack, 43, a firefighter and musician in Murray, Utah, near Salt Lake City, decorates his 1,800-square-foot town house and adjoining 1 1/4-acre property with some 100,000 lights in more than 400 separately controlled groups. ''Bruno'' and ''Winston,'' two talking heads constructed out of lights, emcee his show, telling jokes in the recorded voices of two of Mr. Slack's friends and singing along with seven animated six-foot-tall musicians playing French horns, drums and a saxophone, all mounted on the front of the house. Mr. Slack's 15-minute show, which won an international lights competition run by Planet Christmas last year, has been ramped up this year to include 28 wire-frame reindeer, whose lights can be manipulated to create the impression of one or more animals running across a one-acre pasture, jumping a fence and running off into the bushes. There are also more than 50 miniature trees that appear to be chasing each other, all set against a large lighted cityscape backdrop. Videos of Santa waving are screened in an upstairs window. Mr. Slack takes a two-month vacation before the holidays -- nearly all his yearly vacation time -- to get his light show running. Every minute of music takes more than 20 hours to synchronize, he said, and building the over-the-top display costs him about $5,000 in new equipment each year. But ''people have usually been out fighting the crowds and feeling the pressure to buy gifts and attend Christmas events,'' he said, and ''as they approach my show they seem to forget about all the pressures. Smiles and laughter seem to take the place of worries.'' They may, however, have to sit in 45-minute traffic jams that inevitably back up through the neighborhood to see the show. Dan Baldwin, a software executive who started his career as a computer programmer and electrical engineer, saw opportunity in all the attention that his own computerized light display attracted. In 1999, he designed and built the first one at his home in Garfield, N.J., with trees on the roof, candy-cane shutters and a nativity scene. Visitors raved, and what started as a hobby soon became a full-time business, when Mr. Baldwin started Light-O-Rama in 2002. Since then, he said, his business has grown 300 percent a year. ''Many thousands'' of residential do-it-yourselfers get started for $200, he said, and work up to systems costing $10,000 or more, often installed by professional Christmas decorators. ''It used to be that if there was any animation, it would be a Santa waving or a deer's leg moving, where it looked like he was running, but all those things were uncoordinated,'' said Mr. Baldwin, 52. Even store-bought decorations have become more animated, he said, but with a computerized system, people can coordinate the animation and produce a show. Which is what the Nintendo generation, in particular, craves, said Paul Smith, president of Animated Lighting, a four-year-old Missouri company that manufactures animation software and plug-and-play starter kits, serving some 3,000 homeowners as well as commercial users and municipalities. ''People want a show,'' he said. ''We sell 'wow.' '' Ken Good, 45, a lawyer in Tyler, Tex., switched from a static to a computerized display last year. He said he uses 300 extension cords to run more than 30,000 synchronized lights in his Christmas display, which includes a 12-foot inflatable snowman on the roof and a multimedia show with a voiceover. As the lights dim, a machine fills his yard with fog and a moving spotlight appears. A drum roll sounds, and red lights flash in one tree, then another, then a third, in an accelerating but seemingly random sequence, to the strains of ''Reflections of Earth,'' a k a the fireworks theme from Epcot. At the crescendo, white strobes shine on a different tree, creating a sparkling effect, and the original trees resume their dance in blue, green and red. Finally the entire yard is illuminated in green. ''It's dramatic,'' he said. The music portion of Mr. Good's 25- to 30-minute show, which repeats for several hours each night, can be heard on car radios in his cul-de-sac. It includes ''Believe'' from ''The Polar Express'' and ''Silent Night'' and ends with ''Amazing Grace.'' Predictably, computerized light shows are becoming part of the annual display competitions sent up in the recent movie ''Deck the Halls,'' but they also lend themselves to cooperation among neighbors. Year after year, Rob LaRe of Pickerington, Ohio, tried to outdo his neighbor Rick Griffith with his Christmas lights. Then, three years ago, Mr. LaRe decided that instead of adding more lights, he would make them dance. ''He fired his up and I fired mine up, and he said, 'I've got more,' '' recalled Mr. LaRe, 38, whose home is triple-strung with 40,000 lights. ''I said, 'Yes, but watch this.' '' Mr. Griffith was duly impressed. Instead of competing, the neighbors ended up synchronizing their homes to the same blinking beats using wireless technology. Soon other neighbors were hankering to get in on the act. This year, Mr. LaRe, a graphic and Web designer, connected 13 houses in the neighborhood, hardwiring connections between the houses along each side of the street and using wireless technology to link the houses facing each other. (The display includes one Jewish couple's house with an inflatable menorah and blue-and-white lights.) An FM transmitter broadcasts ''Picktown Lights,'' a loop of 13 Christmas songs, on a frequency advertised by signs on the lawns, with lights on all the houses blinking and pulsing in accompaniment. As passersby cruise down the street oohing and aahing, Mr. LaRe, dressed in a Santa costume, and his neighbors, dressed as elves, hand out candy canes and collect items for a local food pantry. When people ask how the lights were synchronized, Mr. LaRe sticks to a simple explanation. ''It's Christmas magic,'' he says."
"Darren Vigilant, a designer with an eye on the past, tinkered with his New Year's Eve ball on Friday morning, securing light bulbs and preparing it to be hoisted to the top of the eight-story atrium at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel. ''I would build another one in a minute,'' said Mr. Vigilant, 40, clad in overalls and work boots. Unlike the computerized ball that will drop in Times Square tonight, its L.E.D. lights flashing inside a sphere covered with Waterford crystal, Mr. Vigilant's ball, which he built last December for the hotel's New Year's Eve soiree, is old-fashioned. ''They basically got me a couple of black-and-white pictures of the New Year's Eve ball in the '50s,'' he said, referring to a tradition that began in 1907, ''and gave me a mission to build this ball.'' Mr. Vigilant, a designer of high-end furniture and architectural metalwork, worked for three weeks at his workshop in Wayne, N.J., to complete the assignment. He welded an aluminum globe four feet in diameter, strung 1,500 feet of electric wire through it and attached nearly 300 light bulbs to its ribs. The result looks like a slightly smaller copy of the Times Square ball from half a century ago that he used as a model. Mr. Vigilant devised a pulley system for lowering his 300-pound globe, attaching the ball to a stretch of aircraft cable that itself is attached to the building. Standing on the hotel's eighth floor, he will control his creation's descent himself with a variable-speed gear motor and a stopwatch. ''It's very, very nerve-racking for me,'' he said. ''It's lowered 80 feet in one minute's time.'' Mr. Vigilant will also control the 11,000 watts of power feeding the ball's light bulbs. The first third of the bulbs will be turned on at the start; the second third will be turned on as it lowers; and the rest will light up over revelers at the hotel as the clock strikes midnight. Other than the world's most celebrated New Year's ball and his lower-tech version of it, Mr. Vigilant knew of no illuminated balls that drop in the city to ring in the New Year. This is fine with him. ''If it goes off without a hitch,'' he said, ''I'll look like a million dollars.'' JENNIFER BLEYER NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE"
"LOOKS GREAT SERVICES, a Long Island company, will decorate nearly 100 homes with lights, garlands and wreaths this holiday season, but looking back over six years in the business, one job stands out: The woman in Dix Hills who paid nearly $10,000 last year to light her weeping cherry tree with 10,000 lights. ''It was like hair spilling over, every individual branch was wrapped,'' said Lorrie Seide, the operations manager for Looks Great Services, which is in Huntington. ''I went out to see it. It brought tears to my eyes.'' More and more homeowners are relying on companies to install ever-more sophisticated and extensive lighting and decorations to the exteriors of their houses. Ms. Seide, whose company is a franchisee of Christmas Décor, which is based in Lubbock, Tex., said that the typical job runs $2,000 to $3,000 but that some cost as much as $30,000. While no concrete figures exist, those in the industry estimate that the home Christmas lighting and decorating business has grown to $200 million a year nationally. A half-dozen franchise companies operate nationally, with local seasonal businesses like landscapers also offering such services. ''People turn to us for the same reason they hire somebody to mow their lawn or clean their house,'' said Ms. Seide, whose company does storm cleanup much of the year. ''People are so busy today that they don't have time to do anything for themselves.'' But there are other reasons, including safety and the magnitude of the job, that drive residents to seek help with their outdoor Christmas decorating. ''For me it was convenience and safety factors,'' said Frank Gimenez, a retiree who used Looks Great Services to string lights on the roofline of his house in Huntington and to decorate the entrance with garlands. ''I'm older and there's no way I want to get up on the roof anymore.'' Ms. Seide said that companies specializing in lighting could create a display with a tidier and more professional look than most homeowners could. ''Our roof lighting is different than anybody else's,'' she said. ''We make the product to fit the house exactly. There are no nails, and the lights stand like little soldiers.'' The decorating companies also take down the lights once the season is over, and many will store them. ''It definitely pays off,'' said Jean Raio, whose family in North Bellmore on Long Island has used Creative Christmas Decorators the past two years to outline the house and some trees with lights. Creative Christmas Decorators, which is based in Brooklyn and has been in the business for nearly 15 years, has service locations in New Jersey and in Westchester and Nassau Counties. ''Instead of driving yourself crazy, you let them do it,'' Ms. Raio said. ''You're going to spend the same amount of money whether you go to the store or let them do it.'' Ms. Raio said that the display cost $1,250 and that using a professional was better than spending a half-day on a Sunday putting up the lights and decorations as her family used to do. ''I don't miss it at all,'' she said. ''We still do the Christmas tree together.'' Decorating companies work in much the same way, but prices vary depending on the size and complexity of the job. Christian Waugh, the owner of NY Landscape Lighting, which is in Yonkers, said the average cost of an installation in Westchester was about $1,200 for an outlined roof, lighted garland around the front door and two outdoor trees wrapped with minilights. The cost of putting up the lights is less in following years because the customer owns the lights. In contrast, Looks Great Services' fees do not drop in succeeding years, because the lights are leased. Mark Fancher, the owner of Shakespeare's Garden in Brookfield, Conn., which creates distinctive flower displays in gardens during the summer, charges $45 an hour as well as materials for his lighting and Christmas decorating services. A basic job creating wreaths, lights and garlands takes about a day and a half using four people, he said. Among his more ambitious customers was a man who lighted virtually everything on his property in Bethel, Conn. Not only did Mr. Fancher's company light the house, the garage and virtually every tree, but it also created a display over a waterfall so that it looked as if the lights were spilling over with the water. ''It would take six guys about four to five weeks to do his whole place, inside and out,'' Mr. Fancher said, noting that it cost the customer at least $20,000 for the display and nearly $2,000 more a month to light it. ''The first year we blew the transformer out because it was too many lights.'' For Mr. Fancher, the pleasure comes in creating unusual displays, as he is this year for Barry Ivan, a theater director and choreographer whose most recent production was ''Hairspray'' at the North Shore Music Theater in Beverly, Mass. For Mr. Ivan's vintage country home in Brookfield, Conn., Mr. Fancher will use the theme of bringing the outside in and the inside out. For example, trees just outside the house will be lighted so they are visibly incorporated into the decorating inside. ''Friends have come to expect something rather theatrical when they come to visit me at the holiday,'' Mr. Ivan said. ''I'm used to working with sets, lights, costumes and hair designers, and I began to work with him that way. We got into this mode of collaboration.'' Mr. Fancher said: ''It's neat working with him. I almost feel like we're choreographing the house.'' For nearly 30 years, Bruce Rogliano created his own display outside his house in Bronxville, N.Y. But he turned to NY Landscape Lighting as he got older and needed help. One of the biggest benefits, he said, was that the company dealt with any ensuing difficulties; for example, when problems occurred with the lights after a recent rainstorm, NY Landscape Lighting came back and dealt with it. ''I love Christmas,'' Mr. Rogliano said. ''Always did. Lights kind of make the season.'' He outlines parts of his Tudor home, and the trees, shrubs and hedges, some of which are 12 feet high. ''There are so many lights out there you could read a book,'' he said. ''My neighbors think I'm crazy.''"
"Susan Harder, a former photo gallery owner who has lived for decades in the same walk-up apartment on East 10th Street, is the first to acknowledge that she is all of 57 years old, but she emanates an air of schoolgirlish mischief. Her blue eyes twinkle, her blond ponytail bounces, and she punctuates her sentences with what can only be described as giggles. Nevertheless, unlike many schoolgirls, Ms. Harder is a woman with a mission. The mission, which has absorbed her energies 40 hours a week for the past decade, is the fight against what is known by the somewhat anodyne term ''light pollution'' or, as Ms. Harder puts it with typical vigor, ''our insane, just insane love of lighting absolutely everything up.'' From streetlights to billboards to parking lots to private properties, she contends, in cities, suburbs and rural areas, the country is awash in excess light. This light, she claims, squanders money and energy, upsets the ecological balance, causes accidents, makes people sick and diminishes the beauty of the environment, both natural and man-made. The problem may be especially noticeable during the dark days of winter -- Thursday is the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year -- but in the eyes of crusaders like Ms. Harder, it exists year round. ''One day,'' she said on a recent evening, over dinner in a small restaurant on Second Avenue across the street from her apartment, ''we'll look back at light pollution in the same way we do the recycling or ecology movements, and wonder how we ever could have thought otherwise. ''I really do believe that,'' she continued, tapping the table of the restaurant decisively. Ms. Harder's evolution as a crusader against light pollution began 20 years ago. It was then that St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery, which sits on 10th Street near Second Avenue directly across from her apartment, installed a series of ''wall pack'' fixtures around its exterior. Wall packs are those ubiquitous orange floodlights from which emanate as much as 1,000 watts of power; three of them shined directly up into Ms. Harder's apartment. She eventually complained. Church officials responded by saying that they were merely trying to prevent assaults and robberies in the St. Mark's graveyard. Ms. Harder countered that no assaults or robberies were taking place in her bedroom, so why light it up? Church officials finally agreed to tape over the top of the lights, and Ms. Harder went so far as to paint over her windowpanes and install triple-layer blackout curtains, but to little effect. ''I mean, I was being tortured by it,'' she said. (Jimmy Fragosa, church sexton, confirmed that St. Mark's had modified the lights in response to her objections, adding, ''We haven't had any more complaints.'') The following year, a second ''light trespass'' incident, as such events are technically known, took place outside the house in East Hampton that Ms. Harder owns with her partner, John Imperatore. A full-time fighter in the battle against light pollution was born. ''That's when I became a full-time dark-sky advocate,'' Ms. Harder said. ''That's when I knew there was no escape wherever you were.'' Since then, she has come a long way. She has plunged into the byzantine ways of Albany, where three times, unsuccessfully so far, she has lobbied for and contributed information to legislation that would control exterior lighting levels. (Ever hopeful, she plans to try again next year.) She has delved into the arcane world of lumens, foot-candles and uniformity ratios. She has analyzed the pros and cons of high-pressure sodium bulbs versus metal halide ones, and become intimate with the properties of the semi cut-off luminaire -- a luminaire is engineer-speak for a light -- versus the full cut-off luminaire. She eagerly spouts statistics on subjects like a possible link between prolonged exposure to artificial light at night and breast cancer (the correlation exists, she says, citing a 2005 article in the journal Cancer Research) or the connection between additional street lighting and decreases in crime (that connection doesn't exist, she says). Elected officials in the city and beyond have grown accustomed to her combination of sweet talk, cajoling and bullying. In short, Ms. Harder has become a virtual one-woman dark-sky mover and shaker in a city and state that she describes as ''way, way behind the curve'' in their lighting policies. ''The whole Czech Republic has a lighting law,'' she pointed out. ''Lombardy has a lighting law. Malta has a lighting law. Long Island's done wonderful things. But there's something about New York.'' With a jaundiced eye, she gazed at the small park across the street from the restaurant. ''I mean, imagine what they'd make of that in Paris,'' Ms. Harder said. ''But here some lighting designer just dropped down a few standard unshielded high-pressure sodium lights, and the result is a mess. A total mess.'' Despite major victories on Long Island -- the towns of Riverhead, Huntington, East Hampton and most recently Brookhaven have all implemented dark-sky legislation in the past three years, largely based on her suggestions -- Ms. Harder has found New York a tougher nut to crack. This, she and others contend, is because the city's Department of Transportation, which oversees the installation of New York's streetlights, has regularly opposed dark-sky legislation introduced in Albany, citing safety issues. ''The real buzz saw we come up against repeatedly is the city,'' said Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, a Democrat who represents the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island and who three times in the past four years has sponsored dark-sky legislation in Albany with State Senator Carl Marcellino, a Republican from Long Island. ''They have a certain type of approach that theirs is the only way to deal with the issue and 'we're not going to change.' '' In response, Iris Weinshall, the transportation commissioner, said in a statement that the city was taking measures to reduce the wattage of its 180,000 streetlights. But Ms. Weinshall added: ''Our streetlights are critical to keeping pedestrians, motorists and cyclists safe at night, and we'll continue to do our best to make sure that our streets are safe and well-lit."" A department spokeswoman, Kay Sarlin, said the agency receives hundreds of requests a year for new streetlights ''from residents concerned that their streets are too dark.'' And Steven Galgano, executive director of engineering for the agency's Traffic Operations Division, described as ''unacceptable'' any of the new designs for street lighting he had seen from dark-sky advocates. Those designs, he added, were less bright and focused light more directly downward. The fixtures currently used by the department, he said, are only partly shielded and create a uniform blanket of light with no dark patches between the bright spots. On a major urban highway, like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, he added, if motorists had to rapidly adjust their eyes as they move from bright area to dark areas, it could be dangerous. ''But if anyone can show us a full cut-off luminaire that needs less energy and produces the same amount of light,'' Mr. Galgano said, ''we'd be happy to look at it.'' Nor is the Transportation Department the dark-sky movement's only adversary. Opposition also comes from some of the city's business improvement districts, as was apparent one evening a few weeks ago when Ms. Harder conducted a little tour of what she regards as some of the city's dark-sky trouble spots. At the wheel was her partner, Mr. Imperatore, a real estate developer and patient chauffeur. The first stop was Midtown. ''The whole area around Penn Station all the way to Grand Central is just insane,'' Ms. Harder said. ''They put up all these drop-pendant double jobbers using metal halide. It's just sick.'' The ''double jobbers'' were twin-headed 250-watt fixtures that emitted an intense blue-white light, and had been installed by the 34th Street Partnership, a business improvement district. These lights, combined with the lighting on storefronts and billboards in the district, many of them outfitted with 10 or more thousand-watt bulbs, produced a glow that seemed uncannily similar to daylight. People and objects were clearly visible, yet strangely indistinct. Depth of field seemed to disappear. At Seventh Avenue and 36th Street, Ms. Harder pointed out three double-headed fixtures on one corner. ''A cluster glare bomb!'' she announced brightly. Two blocks south, she noted a spot where 11 thousand-watt lights beneath a billboard did battle with a combined 500 watts of street lighting on the corner. Ms. Harder sighed. ''I mean, which responsible human being would design lighting like this?'' she said. Farther downtown, she stopped to comment on what she saw as yet another troublesome area. Lining both sides of Broadway from Fulton Street to the Battery stood fixtures that resembled giant cigarettes placed on end. ''It's Obi-Wan Kenobi's swords!'' Ms. Harder said with a giggle. ''Seriously, lighting designers love this stuff. Their creed is 'Glare is Good.' And there's no light hitting the ground, see? It all hits these beautiful old buildings and washes them out. You can't see a thing.'' Gently, Mr. Imperatore intervened. ''Honey,'' he said, ''I think it's time to head elsewhere.'' He turned south past City Hall, at which point Ms. Harder let out a squeal: ''Ohh! O.K.! There's a great example of good lighting.'' She pointed to a number of gaslights set in historical fixtures, flickering faintly yet clearly illuminating City Hall Park. ''Those are sensitive,'' she said. ''They do their job. They don't blind you, but you can see where you're going.'' It's hard to imagine how dark the city was until well into the 19th century. The first public lighting company, the New York Gas Company, was sanctioned by the city in 1823 to light the streets south of Grand Street. Gaslight was dangerous, flickering and dirty, and most New Yorkers, with good reason, feared the night as a time of disorder. By 1880, crude electric arc lights were set up between 42nd and 53rd Streets along Broadway, the first avenue in the country to be so illuminated, later giving rise to the label ''The Great White Way.'' New inventions began arriving in a frenzy. In 1882, Thomas Edison opened the world's first electric generating station, on Pearl Street. The following year brought a new gas mantle with an incandescent burner that emitted a white light three times as bright as the old gaslights; it, too, would be vanquished by the march of electric lighting. Lest one imagines this light was all for ''serious'' purposes, New Yorkers showed their true concerns early on: By the 1890s, Madison Square was home to a giant electric billboard advertising a Coney Island hotel, 80 feet by 50, consisting of 15,000 individual lights controlled by an operator, and another, 47 feet long, promoting Heinz pickles. In the 1880s, Lady Liberty's hand was so brightly illuminated by electric light that mariners complained and it was toned down. The city's romance with electric light was instant and all-consuming. With all this in mind, the question arises: Are Ms. Harder and her colleagues merely tilting at windmills? Some public-minded people seem genuinely surprised by her views, among them Daniel Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership. In the 1990s, when up to four times as many murders and robberies were reported in the city as now, Mr. Biederman's organization installed the ''double-jobbers'' that Ms. Harder found so offensive. ''Safety was our major goal when we began,'' Mr. Biederman said. ''The area was incredibly dark, and crime was very high. We deliberately chose metal halide because it doesn't impart a sickly glow. The sodium vapor lights made people look as if they were ill.'' Crime statistics over the years have borne out his assumptions, he said, with an overall decrease in street crime in the area since 1991 ''of about 85 to 90 percent.'' For Ms. Harder, such tactics are merely ''overkill.'' ''It seems like everything we do is fear-based,'' she said. ''Look, I don't want to switch off all the lights -- this is New York City -- but I am against excessive and wasteful lighting. You could cut back those wattages by 50 percent and it wouldn't make a difference.'' In response, Mr. Biederman said he was not aware ''of a single letter'' from anyone requesting less light, but added that he would be happy to discuss ways to address the situation while still keeping things safe. ''I'd be absolutely receptive to it,'' he said. ''And I'd do it at some cost, too, if we felt it was right.'' Given New York's early sweet tooth for electric advertisements, it's not surprising that bright ads and billboards continue to be a major part of the city's light pollution problem. Councilman Alan Gerson, whose district includes SoHo, NoHo and the Lower East Side, is drafting legislation to control certain flashing illuminated billboards, private security lights on roofs and other such ''nuisance'' lights. ''It's a growing problem,'' said Mr. Gerson, who hopes to introduce his legislation early next year and is optimistic about its chances. ''Buildings are putting up intense lights on their facades and rooftops, for commercial or security reasons, and they forget it shines into people's windows.'' Despite these and other obstacles, Ms. Harder remains an optimist. ''More and more advocacy groups are adopting lighting pollution as part of their collective agenda,'' she said. ''The fact that the Sierra Club has taken on the issue, the fact that the American Lung Association and the Natural Resources Defense Council both came out behind Grannis's legislation -- this is fantastic.'' Ben Gibberd's book ''New York Waters: Profiles From the Edge,'' with photographs by Randy Duchaine, will be published in May by Globe Pequot Press."
"Q. Are there any inexpensive light fixtures I can install in my summer place that I won't mind leaving behind? A. Most decorative fixtures that sell for under $100 skimp on both quality and design, so simple is nearly always best. When I work with friends on a limited budget, I recommend the basics with a little flair. On your way out of town, pick up some Sunlite Porcelain Ceiling Lamp Holders, above, which are exposed sockets mounted on solid disks. Despite the name, they can also be used as wall sconces. They sell for $2.49 at Lighting & Beyond, 35 West 14th Street (Sixth Avenue), (212) 929-2738, lightingandbeyond.com. These porcelain sockets have gained cult status among architects like Richard Gluckman. Although they have a reputation as hardware-store items, they are versatile and come in a tasteful off-white. If you install them yourself, be sure to turn off the power at the breaker. You may also need to patch after you're done, since the porcelain may not completely cover gaps around the fixture. I give the porcelain lamp holders an earthy 1970's vibe by using compact fluorescent spheres instead of traditional 40-watt globes. The fluorescent bulbs approximate incandescent tones from ''warm white'' to a less pinkish ''soft white''; be prepared to test bulbs from several manufacturers to find the color you prefer. A 2 1/2-inch, 9-watt, candelabra-based sphere (with a converter for regular sockets) and a 3 1/2-inch Sunpark sphere that uses 11 watts are both warm white and sell for $7.99 each at Lighting & Beyond. Try adding a clip-on drum shade with a built-in lid that looks like one of Jackie Kennedy's pillbox hats. A selection of 10-inch-diameter cylinders, which are four inches high, are available for $48 each, from the new Kate's Paperie at Home, 72 Spring Street (Crosby Street), (212) 334-1010; www.katespaperie.com. A clear bulb in a porcelain lamp holder can also be adorned with Tord Boontje's familiar Garland -- a lacy cascade of paper-thin stamped-steel flowers and leaves -- in the less-familiar rusted finish. The Garland, in a size known as Double, comes with 15 feet of electrical cord and a socket, and sells for $135 at Moss, 146 Greene Street (Houston Street), (212) 204-7100; www.mossonline.com. For a ceiling fixture in a modest foyer at the beach, West Elm now offers a smaller pendant of translucent milky-white capiz shells ($59). The shells hang from a chromed hoop about 8 inches in diameter; (888)922-4119, www.westelm.com. The company also sells a 13-inch-high Small Tapered Cylinder Pendant lamp ($49) that would work in a powder room. The glossy shade hangs on a simple length of electrical cord. If your dining room is large enough, wire in a dimmer switch and, for task lighting, exchange your existing pendant for a porcelain lamp holder fitted with a 75-watt PAR-30 halogen flood bulb from the hardware store. To complement it, apply matte white spray paint to a pair of non-electrified wrought-iron candle chandeliers. Hung over the table and outfitted with pale beeswax candles, the chandeliers should spark your late-summer suppers. Bon appétit."
"Q. How can I light my yard without wasting lots of energy? A. Fall is a prime season for installing landscape lighting. As September wanes, the cooler days facilitate manual labor like trenching through the lawn to bury cables. Many outdoor lighting systems take household electricity and step it down to 12 volts using a transformer. (The difference has more to do with safety than energy efficiency; lower voltage is easier to work with.) Fortunately, low-voltage fixtures no longer rely exclusively on inefficient bulbs. Some new fixtures use halogen bulbs. To push conservation further, try Nightscaping's low-voltage compact fluorescent fixtures like the $159 Apollo, an 11-watt copper-shaded pendant (bulb included); (800) 544-4840; nightscaping.com. Efficiency, however, has a price: the bulbs may not work when the air temperature dips below 35 degrees Fahrenheit. If you decide to wire the yard for the standard 120 volts, rather than 12, Home Depot offers the SiteLight weatherproof, glass-lensed miniature flood light in architectural bronze from Red Dot for $19. (An online special reduces the price to $13.30 through the end of the month; 800-435-4654; homedepot.com.) I was delighted to discover that the fixture holds a 9-watt mini spiral compact fluorescent bulb (about $6 each from Home Depot). Even if you are planning to read in your garden at night, be careful not to overlight. You may not need as many fixtures as you think; work around existing lighting and focus on the underlighted areas, where low-wattage fixtures will have the most impact. Indoor switches controlling regular incandescent or halogen outdoor floodlights can be swapped for dimmer switches, which pull down the wattage to add drama and conserve energy. Safety concerns may suggest putting path lights every five feet along a walkway. But before you finish placing them, test the fixtures after dark to see how far apart you can stretch them. (It is not hard to fill holes in the ground if you misjudged.) Some areas should be brighter: the space near a picnic table, perhaps, or around a tool shed. And focal points will need highlights if you want to view them from indoors, where eyes are adjusted to higher light levels. You can put bright outdoor lights on their own switches or circuits, to limit their use. The same goes for the special lighting used for parties. One of my neighbors draped the fence of his town house garden with a long strand of clear holiday bulbs that instantly transform the mood whenever he wants to have a festive evening. Or go off the grid altogether. Set out tiki torches, or candles in hurricane shades, which add not only atmosphere but illumination. To achieve an effect known as moonlighting, place fixtures high in mature trees to illuminate the branches and dapple the ground. Smith & Hawken sells $89 solar-charged floodlights, above, which have 16 light-emitting diodes. The L.E.D.'s do not mix especially well with other kinds (and colors) of light. But they are a satisfactory approximation of the full moon if you mount several in each tree; (800) 940-1170; smithandhawken.com.

"INCANDESCENT bulbs have long put the glow in flashlights, but they are being supplanted by a new generation of light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s -- those tiny semiconductor devices that shine when electricity flows through them. Developed in the last few years, these L.E.D.'s are not those puny ones of a decade ago -- like the ones that cast a dim beam from a keychain. The new versions throw off lots of white light, are virtually unbreakable and draw far less power from batteries than do their incandescent counterparts. And L.E.D.'s are now found not only in flashlights but also in related products like camping lanterns and hikers' headlamps. L.E.D.'s are as much as five times as efficient as incandescent flashlight bulbs, in part because they shed less energy as heat, said Nadarajah Narendran, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., who is head of research at its Lighting Research Center. A lightbulb that is five times as efficient as another uses a fifth the power to produce the same light, he said. ''All of a sudden, we have a technology that can make batteries last much longer,'' Professor Narendran said. Flashlights, headlamps and camping lights with L.E.D.'s typically cost more than incandescents, although the difference has been narrowing rapidly and is offset by lower maintenance costs. ''A flashlight with two D batteries and an incandescent bulb can be bought for less than $5,'' he said. ''L.E.D. flashlights will typically be at least a few dollars more.'' Higher-power L.E.D. flashlights typically cost $40 to $100. Mike Dyson of Baltimore uses a high-power L.E.D. flashlight to peer inside movie projectors, which he installs and repairs. Earlier L.E.D.'s had a bit of blue in the light, he said, and that affected his perception of color-coded wiring. But no longer. ''The newer L.E.D.'s are pretty much pure white,'' he said, so they are ''excellent for picking out the exact colors of wires.'' Mr. Dyson buys his flashlights mainly online. Among his favorites is a Fenix P1 L.E.D. flashlight ($43.50 at www.brightguy.com). ''It's powerful,'' he said, ''but so small, 2.5 inches, that it fits on a keychain.'' The label ''L.E.D.'' does not guarantee a more efficient flashlight, Professor Narendran said. The longevity of any power source depends on the circuit, the design and ''how brightly you want to run the device,'' he said. Buyers should look at manufacturers' or sellers' Web sites to see how long a flashlight lasts in continuous use at full power, he advised. ''There's no point in having one-tenth the light you need,'' he said, ''even if it does last 10 times longer.'' And a sleek appearance doesn't necessarily mean a great product. ''The flashlight's efficiency will depend on how the system within it is put together,'' he said. M. Shane Peterson, a carpenter and furniture maker in Cleveland, likes the detailed product information on battery life and illumination made available by SureFire, a maker of L.E.D. and incandescent flashlights in Fountain Valley, Calif. Among the products he likes is the SureFire E1L Outdoorsman L.E.D. ($99 at www.brightguy.com). It gives off about the same amount of light as a large incandescent flashlight with two D batteries but weighs only 2.6 ounces with a lithium battery. ''It's great to throw in your case for an emergency,'' he said. L.E.D. flashlights have found a niche in the emergency lighting market, said Tom Beckett, president of Dorcy International in Columbus, Ohio; it produces camping lanterns and reading lights as well as flashlights. It offers a hand-cranked flashlight, called the Dynamo, for use in power blackouts; one version comes with a radio. When users wind the handle on the flashlight, the L.E.D.'s light up. ''You only got 10 seconds or so of light when you cranked this kind of device with an incandescent bulb,'' he said, but L.E.D.'s are so efficient that one to two minutes of winding generates 8 to 12 minutes of light. Camping lanterns, too, are receiving L.E.D. upgrades. At Coleman in Wichita, Kan., Kevin Tarter, manager of design engineering, said the company would add two new L.E.D. lanterns this winter, including one that collapses into a cube a few inches high. Pull it open and the lantern sheds light for 12 hours on the low setting, 6 hours on high, and 75 hours on emergency strobe. The advantages of L.E.D.'s, he said, make them an obvious choice for lanterns. ''We can get extraordinary light output with lower amperage,'' Mr. Tarter said, ''which is very important for outdoor campers and backpackers -- and there's no bulb to break while you are out in the woods.'' THE durability of L.E.D.'s leads to other applications. Cave explorers have been early adopters of L.E.D. headlamps, said Roger Brucker, a retired advertising executive who has written books about caves. The headlamps are handy outside caves, too: Mr. Brucker took along an L.E.D. headlamp when he and his wife went on a tandem bicycle ride last summer from Dayton, Ohio, to Bar Harbor, Me. ''When we camped, I used the headlamp to read books by,'' he said, ''or to see my way around to go to the bathroom.'' Mountaineers also use L.E.D. headlamps. Peter McConkie, who works for a wholesale distributor of camping and climbing gear in Salt Lake City, spends several days a week after work on the nearby Wasatch Mountain Range. Typically, he skis to the place where he will climb. He prefers waterproof L.E.D. headlamps from Princeton Tec, in Princeton, N.J. ''I have never had one of their headlamps fail on me,'' he said, ''although I have dropped them in the river.'' L.E.D.'s are not about to replace regular or fluorescent bulbs in general lighting -- they are still far too expensive. An L.E.D. version of a 60-watt spotlight, for instance, costs about $90. But flashlights are another story: L.E.D. versions now make up 48 percent of the flashlight line at Garrity Industries, in Madison, Conn., said Kevin Garrity, the president, although it introduced them only three years ago. The company is part of the Duracell division of Procter & Gamble. ''For the first year or so, buyers were hard-core professional users like mountain climbers and people in law enforcement,'' he said. ''But since then, the mass market has begun trying the product.'' Energizer, in St. Louis, is also adapting its flashlight line to L.E.D.'s, said Tricia Schuler, director of sales and marketing for lighting products. ''Ninety percent of our new products that we are launching are L.E.D.-based,'' she said, ''and half the flashlights currently offered are L.E.D.-based.'' Mag Instrument of Ontario, Calif., which makes Maglite flashlights, is also making L.E.D. versions of many of its products, said John Wyatt, vice president for sales. The company offers an upgrade module that costs about $20 and converts an incandescent Maglite into an L.E.D. one. Mr. Wyatt said he had seen growth in L.E.D. flashlight products on the market, and a contraction in the number of incandescent ones. But he wasn't ready to predict the demise of the incandescent bulb. ''If you are concerned about price,'' he said, ''incandescents are still far cheaper.'' NOVELTIES E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com."
"A coalition of industrialists, environmentalists and energy specialists is banding together to try to eliminate the incandescent light bulb in about 10 years. In an agreement to be announced Wednesday, the coalition members, including Philips Lighting, the largest manufacturer; the Natural Resources Defense Council; and two efficiency organizations, are pledging to press for efficiency standards at the local, state and federal levels. The standards would phase out the ordinary screw-in bulb, technology that arose around the time of the telegraph and the steam locomotive, and replace it with compact fluorescents, light-emitting diodes, halogen devices and other technologies that may emerge. Compact fluorescents are three times as efficient as old-fashioned bulbs, and light-emitting diodes six times as efficient. These also last much longer. But while they cost much less to run, they are more expensive to purchase, and getting home users to change the bulbs in the estimated four billion sockets in the United States would probably require eliminating the choice. James E. Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy and the co-chairman of one of the efficiency organizations in the coalition, the Alliance to Save Energy, said in a statement, ''Encouraging our customers to use advanced compact fluorescent light bulbs and other energy-efficient lighting is fundamental to our plans to meet growing demand for electricity as economically as possible.'' The agreement is a compromise among the participants. Some favored an outright ban on incandescent bulbs, like the one Australia said last month it would seek by 2009 or 2010. Philips, a unit of Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands, has pledged with others doing business in Europe to seek a shift to more efficient lighting there, too. The announcement planned Wednesday in Washington will commit coalition members to seek ''a market phaseout'' by 2016. General Electric, the largest American manufacturer of lighting, has recently been campaigning against the elimination of incandescent bulbs, and promising instead to bring out a new model that is twice as efficient as its current bulbs. The company is not part of the new coalition. But it has allied itself with the Natural Resources Defense Council in another group called the United States Carbon Action Program, which seeks to control emissions of greenhouse gases through energy conservation. Noah Horowitz, a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said his group favored a performance standard, like the ones already in place for appliances like refrigerators, that would effectively require manufacturers to give up the traditional bulb. ''We've given up a sound bite, 'ban the incandescent,' as opposed to a phaseout of the incandescent and a move to more efficient lighting,'' Mr. Horowitz said, adding that the reason was to avoid angering consumers. Replacing incandescent lamps could slow the growth in greenhouse-gas emissions, but not radically. About 22 percent of electricity is used for lighting, and about 42 percent of that is now generated by incandescent bulbs, according to the organizers. That means that a little over 9 percent of all electricity is used in incandescent bulbs. If that figure were cut by half, it would be equivalent to two or three years of growth in electric demand. Replacing older fluorescent lamps with newer, more efficient ones would help, too. The participants say that a complete phaseout would save $18 billion a year in electricity, and save the amount of power that would be produced by 30 nuclear reactors or as many as 80 coal plants. It would also eliminate substantial mercury emissions from the coal plants, they said. The Australian government said on Feb. 20 that it would seek to ban incandescent bulbs and replace them with compact fluorescents. Shortly thereafter, the environment minister of Ontario, Laurel Broten, said her province was considering a similar step, and a California assemblyman, Lloyd Levine, introduced a bill to do the same. ''Incandescent light bulbs were first developed almost 125 years ago,'' Mr. Levine said, ''and since that time they have undergone no major modifications.'' Kathleen Rogers, president of the Earth Day Network, one of the groups in the alliance seeking to end the use of incandescent bulbs, predicted, ''I think you're going to see these disparate efforts adding up to this great tidal wave.'' The problem, she said, was that ''the incandescent spends most of its life making heat, not light.'' But General Electric, which traces its origins to Edison, said that could change. ''It's shortsighted to freeze technology in favor of today's high-efficiency compact fluorescent lamps,'' the company said in a statement. ''We'd rather keep innovating and offering traditional, commercial and industrial consumers more energy-efficient choices -- not fewer choices.'' Alexander A. Karsner, the assistant secretary of energy for efficiency and renewables, said that the government could theoretically force the change. ''Government has a legislative hammer in the toolbox,'' he said. ''But to be prescriptive on the next product technology is probably not a way we want to go.'' Setting a performance standard would be better, he said, because that would allow the industry to comply with whatever technology it could best provide. Correction: March 17, 2007, Saturday An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a coalition of industrialists, environmentalists and energy specialists who are trying to eliminate the incandescent light bulb misstated the name of a business-environmental group that cooperates on global warming issues. It is the United States Climate Action Partnership, not the United States Carbon Action Program."
"Q. Are compact fluorescent light bulbs the only energy-saving option? A. You might try light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, which give out more light per watt of electricity than compact fluorescent bulbs. Light-emitting diodes were invented in the '50s. They are semiconductor devices -- a kind of computer chip -- that give off light when current is applied to them. Depending on their chemical makeup, they can emit green, blue, red or white light. L.E.D.'s are now available with standard screw-type bases, so they can easily replace incandescent or compact fluorescent bulbs in your home. They are also sold in ''high-hat,'' or downlighting, fixtures for the ceiling. The face of most L.E.D. bulbs looks like a circuit board and the light they put out resembles a cluster of brilliant dots, each about the size of an aspirin tablet. An L.E.D.'s light is much whiter than that of a standard incandescent bulb, or even a compact fluorescent bulb, and L.E.D.'s work well on a dimmer or a timer. But like spotlights, they cast their light in one direction, so they don't work in table lamps. L.E.D.'s produce about 70 lumens (the standard measure for light) per watt, whereas an incandescent bulb produces only 10 to 15 and the compact fluorescent, only about 35. Unlike compact fluorescent bulbs, L.E.D.'s have no mercury, an important environmental consideration because most bulbs end up in landfills. L.E.D.'s cost more than either conventional or compact fluorescent bulbs, but they last far longer. Whereas the average incandescent bulb costs less than a dollar and a compact fluorescent bulb can sell for a few dollars, some L.E.D.'s run as high as $90 a bulb. But L.E.D. lights are typically rated as having a lifespan of 30,000 to 50,000 hours. So an L.E.D. bulb can last for more than 10 years, if you use it 8 hours a day. Compact fluorescents are typically rated at 7,500 to 10,000 hours, and incandescents at about 1,500 hours. Rather than burning out as incandescent bulbs do, L.E.D.'s light output dims over tens of thousands of hours. L.E.D.'s are also more resistant to vibration than incandescents or screw-in fluorescent bulbs, and do not flicker or hum. The city of Raleigh, N.C., recently announced that it will begin installing L.E.D.'s in some of its streetlights, and if they work well, will consider converting all 33,000 streetlights to L.E.D., according to Daniel Howe, an assistant city manager. Raleigh is using L.E.D. lights made by Cree Inc., of Durham, N.C., with components developed by the Lighting Sciences Group, of Dallas, which also makes bulbs for home use, shown above. Kim Freeman, a spokeswoman for General Electric, said the company makes L.E.D.'s, but only for commercial uses like outdoor signs, which are often in locations where changing a bulb is difficult. But given the high price of L.E.D.'s, she said, the company is focusing ''on the commercial side,'' rather than on making bulbs for home use, although that could change with progress in manufacturing. Smaller companies, though, are marketing them for use in the home, and L.E.D.'s are easy to buy on the Internet. Jeffrey Harris, a vice president at the Alliance to Save Energy, a Washington, D.C.,-based advocacy group, said, ''L.E.D. lighting represents one of the most promising energy-efficient lighting solutions for the future,'' but costs have to come down before L.E.D.'s will be universally accepted for residential use. Exactly how much energy might be saved with widespread use of L.E.D.'s is not clear, but their long life makes them appealing for use in hard-to-reach places. They are gaining wide use as Christmas lights, and the Capitol Christmas tree was decorated with 10,000 of them last year."
"All along the median that divides Jericho Turnpike, the major commercial strip in the far eastern Queens neighborhood of Bellerose, genteel green lampposts with curlicue designs loom over the street, each with two cast-iron arms that droop their lights over the roadway. Several are still graced with cheery banners from the holidays. Every so often, however, as is the case in front of Double K Electric and the Soap Box Laundromat at 247th Street, the pleasant line of throwback streetlights -- the design dates to 1916 -- is interrupted by a nonconformist intruder. At that intersection and a handful of others, there stands a drab aluminum lamppost of much more recent vintage: the 1960s. Call it a Pinto in a line of Porsches. ''You have a whole row of these lovely lights that have really spruced up the block quite a bit,'' said Richard Hellenbrecht, chairman of Community Board 13. ''All of a sudden, you come across this one ridiculous thing that's still there and really shouldn't be.'' The lampposts, which span a mile and a half of the turnpike, were installed as part of a beautification project arranged by the local business improvement district and financed with state grants. Only five streetlights from the '60s still need to be replaced with the spiffier retro designs. The problem is that the district ran out of money. James Trent, vice president of the improvement district, said that under state law, organizations like his are required to spend their own money on improvements and then get reimbursement. The state did not enforce the requirement for the building of most of the lampposts, Mr. Trent said, but did for the few remaining streetlights. Dan Weiller, a spokesman for the state comptroller's office, confirmed that the state requires upfront expenditures to receive grant money. But there are exceptions, he added. In any event, $60,000 to $80,000 will be needed to install the remaining streetlights, Mr. Trent estimated. Unfortunately, he said, the budget of the business improvement district is but a fraction of that amount. ''So we can't finish the last lousy five poles,'' Mr. Trent said, adding that he charged part of the project on his own credit card in hope of completing it. ''It definitely doesn't look good,'' a local worker said of the unchanged lampposts. ''It stands out. You want it to be all one type, you know.'' JEFF VANDAM NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BELLEROSE"
"THE steely blue beam of high intensity discharge headlights was once a way for luxury carmakers to distinguish their products after dark. But with the H.I.D. lights increasingly popular on midprice cars, luxury-level marketers need a new novelty. The 2008 Lexus LS 600h L will pioneer one new direction as the first production automobile to use light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, as headlamps. It will rely on L.E.D.'s only for its low beams and daytime running lights. H.I.D. lamps will do the heavy lifting on high beam, partly because they work better with the sensors in the car's collision-avoidance system. As cars gradually abandon the descendants of Thomas Edison's incandescent bulb and switch to L.E.D.'s, developing headlights that automatically adjust to driving conditions may become simpler. ''Headlights could adapt to speed, steering wheel input,'' said Fred Peterson, engineering director for Osram Sylvania, which produces lamps for automakers. ''All the information you have the vehicle collecting could be fed into L.E.D.'s.'' Mr. Peterson said that an L.E.D. headlight could use an array of about 25 high-powered diodes. In the same way that diodes can be switched on and off to create images on stadium scoreboards, the diodes in a headlight array could be dimmed, brightened or switched off to alter the beam pattern for driving at high speeds on dark highways, to accommodate snow, rain and fog, and for turning corners. A few issues must be resolved before that happens. Mr. Peterson said that current high-powered L.E.D.'s drew more electricity and produced more heat than conventional lamps. L.E.D. headlight designers will have to rely on materials for lenses and reflectors that will not melt once darkness comes. IAN AUSTEN"
"Before dawn yesterday, two electricians and a supervisor changed colors on the Empire State Building's north face during the test of new light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, to provide a visual comparison. To do it, they climbed out office windows to switch the colored filters called gels atop floodlights installed on the parapets. Changing the gels: it has been a way of life for maintenance workers at the building since its lighting was colorized in 1976, when red, white and blue celebrated the nation's Bicentennial. It will soon be a thing of the past, as the building installs a new, high-tech lighting system. On a recent afternoon a crew of five showed how it has been done for years, installing 15 blue gels in a bank of floodlights on the 72nd floor. The gels -- 30-inch-wide circles of weather-resistant Lexan plastic -- are the size of delivery pizzas and are designed to snap onto the 3-foot-tall drumlike floodlights with their metal halide lamps. Changing the gels is labor-intensive, requiring the effort of six workers toiling for six hours, while the lights themselves are electricity hogs. The new light-emitting diodes will give off less heat and last far longer than the metal halide lamps. ''And you can program the lighting patterns on a keyboard,'' said Hani J. Salama, the building's director of operations. Though they need some maintenance, the new L.E.D.'s would significantly reduce the electricians' exposure to driving rain and slippery ice. Crews are accustomed to snow that floats heavenward in updrafts, and drifts that bury the building's parapets to the top of the floodlights. In early evening, bats have sometimes congregated on high, and ''there are also hawk attacks,'' said Bill Tortorelli, the building's 63-year-old chief electrician. Several electricians recalled the time a few years ago when they counted 21 hawks wheeling around the building; one of them dive-bombed, but missed, the workers, said Jake Nouel, 54, an electrician who has been changing the gels for 27 years. Then there was the time that ''one of the workers lost his teeth in the snow on the parapet, and we had to wait for the thaw to find them,'' Mr. Tortorelli recalled. After the L.E.D. installation is complete, most likely in 2008, the electricians will be reassigned to other maintenance duties, Mr. Tortorelli said, adding, ''No one will lose a job, because there's so much to do inside the building.'' But, in a funny way, they will miss the gels. ''The views of the city, the fact that these colors were important to New York, and that we had a part in it -- well,'' Mr. Nouel said, ''it was fun, even when the hawks came at us.'' He sighed. ''We'll do other things now, so it will be different. But it won't be as glamorous.''"
"Before most of Manhattan could shake itself out of bed, the great Empire State Building light-show smackdown -- an eerily silent rainbow of shifting color high above the city that continued for 71 predawn minutes yesterday -- had its finale an hour before sunrise. At stake was a $5 million contract to bring 21st-century illumination to the city's tallest skyscraper. And so, four blocks away from the building that jutted into the clear night sky, in a command center 28 floors above depopulated streets, walkie-talkies squawked as the building's management witnessed a Kong vs. Godzilla face-off between two lighting behemoths. ''Now that's a red,'' said James T. Connors, the general manager of the Empire State Building Company, observing solid test-pattern blocks of color as they bathed nine floors in light. Primary hues soon yielded to vibrant stripes, spectrum cascades, strobe effects and programmed sequences called ''Fourth of July,'' ''New Year's Eve'' and ''Fireworks.'' Above, on the narrow 72nd floor parapet of the skyscraper at Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street -- which is ordinarily dark after midnight -- the two contenders, Color Kinetics Inc. and Philips Electronics, had installed test stands of high-brightness light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s. The test marked the beginning of a high-tech future for the landmark skyscraper. For more than a quarter century, the color of the floodlights has been changed by teams of maintenance workers. More than 200 times a year, the workers brave the elements for six hours to install, by hand, colored plastic lenses on 208 10,000-watt upward-facing floodlights on the 72nd and 81st floors, and more lights in the spire. In the future, the building will be flooded in ''intelligent illumination,'' employing a new generation of computer-controlled L.E.D.'s capable of producing millions of colors and an infinity of patterns. Yesterday's test began at 3:58 a.m. Floors 72 to 81 on the western face were illuminated: Color Kinetics on the northern portion of the face, and Philips to the south. The competition demonstrates ''nothing less than the digitalization of an entire major industry, replacing archaic mechanical illumination with smarter lighting,'' said William Sims, president of Color Kinetics Inc. of Boston, which has lighted the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles International Airport and the Broadway musical ''Wicked.'' The new L.E.D.'s ''would allow us to showcase the building in many new ways,'' said Mr. Connors in the command center at West 38th Street and Broadway. Lighting is part of a years-long, $400 million refurbishment of the building's infrastructure and interiors that, he hopes, will ''positively affect the perception of the commercial aspects of the building,'' which has 102 public floors and was visited by four million tourists last year. Lighting at the Empire, as its employees call the building, has long marked a complex annual ritual: blue and white for Hanukkah, red and green for the December holiday season, yellow and white for spring, and green for St. Patrick's Day. Often the calendar has been punctuated by special events, as when the building went blue in honor of the passing of Frank Sinatra, Ol' Blue Eyes. And it has been lights-out for decades during migratory seasons for birds. The skyscraper's lights were first turned on by President Herbert Hoover on May 1, 1931, when he pressed a button in Washington, D.C. By 1956, revolving beacons, called Freedom Lights, were installed to symbolize peace. Floodlights washed the side of the building in white for the 1964 World's Fair, and colors arrived in 1976 for the Bicentennial. In January, at a previous face-off, both companies were sent back to the drawing board to improve their colors, especially white. This time, ''we were psyched and excited'' about the test, said Govi V. Rao, general manager of Philips's North American solid-state lighting division. The company, which is based in Amsterdam, has lighted such places as Buckingham Palace in London and Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul. The test lights -- light-emitting silicon chips encased in plastic and glass lenses less than an inch wide -- are grouped in frames, and can be switched on and off thousands of times a second in various computer-controlled sequences that the brain interprets as distinct colors. The lights are expected to last 5 to 10 years; they have cut the cost of illuminating other buildings 10 to 50 percent. Mr. Connors said the test was a success, and that ''the L.E.D.'s outperformed the floodlights,'' but he reserved opinion on the winner, which will not be decided until the companies bid for the job. Installation could begin as early as the fall for a debut in 2008. As a beacon, the building has a civic role, Mr. Connors emphasized, and ''we're not planning for this to be a billboard or a commercial venue.'' But the new illumination ''would give us the flexibility to change colors at the push of a few buttons,'' he said, on a computer console, laptop, or even a hand-held computer. ''The building could change color on the hour, so that you could have a clock tower without a clock. Or we could have a light show -- in sync with music that could be simulcast on radio.'' Not every New Yorker may welcome a transformation from the stately former lighting. Ric Burns, the filmmaker who directed the World Trade Center documentary ''The Center of the World,'' said, ''It's scary to think that we could have a zebra-striped or a leopard-spotted Empire State Building. However, if they do something garish and vulgar, the people will make their voice felt.'' He added: ''But when they changed the lighting on the George Washington Bridge, it was fantastic. And if you've seen the Eiffel Tower sparkling with lights -- it takes your breath away.''"
"Q. How high over my dining table should I hang the light fixture? A. A pendant lamp or chandelier suspended above a dining table can provide both illumination and a sense of intimacy for people sitting down to a meal together, as long as it is hanging at the right height. Too high and you may need to turn up the light, which makes it difficult to create a cozy atmosphere; too low and you'll feel crowded. Before you think about how to hang your fixture, make sure it can be controlled with a dimmer switch, so that you can change the mood of the room. Home Depot offers options under $25 that can replace a regular light switch. When you are ready to install the light fixture, set up a stepladder or other safe platform and have someone dangle the lamp from above so you can check the height. ''The standard is generally around 30 inches from the top of the table'' to the bottom of a pendant lamp, regardless of ceiling height, said Danielle Galland, an interior design instructor at Parsons the New School for Design. But that distance can vary depending on the style of the fixture. ''You can sometimes go as high as 42 inches,'' said Ms. Galland (www.dgalland.com). ''When you sit down, you should not be looking into a bulb.'' Leave enough space between the bottom of the fixture and the top of the tallest of your candlesticks (with candles in them) and vases (with flowers). While your helper is holding the fixture in place, place those objects on the table and make sure they have at least a few inches of clearance. A pendant light is not your only option. Elena Frampton, the co-owner of an interior design firm called Curated (www.curatedstudio.com), recently renovated an apartment in Harlem with a dining room that required a creative lighting solution. ''Here in New York, we're often presented with space limitations, such as creating a living and dining area in one room,'' Ms. Frampton said. In this case she had to find lighting that served both functions, and she also had another problem: the dining table was in front of a wall of windows, and the owners didn't want to block the view. Ms. Frampton installed a Flos Celestia light ($486.50 from the Lighting Center, 240 East 59th Street, lightingcenter-ny.com, 800-417-9860), which has a large cloud-like linen diffuser that attaches directly to the ceiling, delivering an ambient glow rather than lighting focused on the table. If you want the fixture to hang closer to the table on some occasions and closer to the ceiling on others, you could consider an adjustable pendant. Marzais Créations, a French company, makes a large elliptical pendant on stainless steel cables, called Dune, that has a 43-inch-wide shade that can be retracted with a cord ($1,158 from Sipure Design in Miami, Fla.; 305-940-4655 or sipuredesign.com). For something a little smaller, consider YLighting's Pulley Pendant Light (now on sale for $300), which has a conical nickel shade 18 inches in diameter (866-428-9289 or ylighting.com). Lighting a dining room is as much about creating an intimate atmosphere as it is about illuminating the food. Installing the right pendant lamp at the right height is the first step, but you should also try experimenting with candles, sconces and table lamps."
"CONFERENCE rooms usually have digital projectors that presenters can use to show off PowerPoint slides and other visuals stored on their laptops. But road warriors selling goods or giving talks at impromptu sites can't count on this amenity for their presentations. They have to lug along their own projectors, just in case. That's less of a chore these days, because the size of projectors has dropped over the last four years, while image quality has risen. Now there is a choice of compact, portable projectors in the under-4-pounds category and are lighter than some city telephone directories. These small, business-style projectors aren't made to show off rich color in darkened rooms, the way that home movie-theater projectors are. Instead, most have optics designed to favor brightness over color so that they can cast crisp images of spreadsheets even when fluorescent lights are on. The NEC Corporation offers a good example of these lightweight projectors: the NP60, widely available since January ($1,299 at ProjectorCentral.com). The NP60 has a bulb that puts out 3,000 lumens, enough light to throw a sharp, 100-inch diagonal image onto a screen or wall even when lights are aglow in a conference room. The projector weighs only 3.5 pounds; its large display can easily be seen in rooms holding 40 or even more people. The arc bulb that produces the light lasts about 2,000 hours; a replacement costs $329. The projector includes a sensor that automatically squares the images, as well as one that focuses the lens. For presentations in smaller sites -- when the audience, say, is two or three people in a cubicle -- another new type of projector works well. These compact devices, called pocket projectors, use L.E.D.'s, or light-emitting diodes, rather than the arc lamps of larger portable projectors. The L.E.D. projectors put out far less raw light and create smaller images than their arc-lamp counterparts. But if no conference room is available and you need to make your sales presentation in a small borrowed office or hotel lobby, these projectors will do the trick -- provided that there is a nearby wall where you can cast the images. Samsung offers one of these projectors, the Pocket Imager SP-P310MEMX, ($749), introduced in January. It weighs 1.5 pounds. The power cord attaches to an AC adapter, which adds 1.25 pounds; a battery that is sold separately ($149) lasts for 2.5 hours and weighs less than a pound. The Samsung projector casts 50 lumens, a small amount of light but enough to work effectively at short ranges. For example, it creates a clear 35-inch diagonal image at a distance of four feet. Its L.E.D.'s are far more efficient than incandescent bulbs and have a lifetime of about 10,000 hours. Portables like the Samsung and NEC models may be purchased initially for use on the job. But they have other applications, too. When the workweek is done, some people take them home and attach them to game machines, or plug them into a DVD player to watch movies. The cost of the projectors will probably have to drop a bit, though, before they become popular consumer items. To see how well the projectors worked, a friend and I tried them out, with both PowerPoint shows and movies. First we experimented with PowerPoint, hooking up the Samsung Pocket Imager to a laptop. This was quick and easy to do. The Pocket Imager, however, comes with a native, or built-in, resolution of 800 by 600 pixels, called S.V.G.A., shown in an aspect ratio or display of 4:3. But the laptop I used with the Pocket Imager has a wider aspect ratio, 16:9, and has a resolution of 1,366 by 768. I was concerned that the projector and the laptop did not have a one-for-one match in resolution. In some equipment, this disparity can create problems like chopping off part of the image. But Chris Chinnock, the president of Insight Media, a market research firm in Norwalk, Conn., that specializes in the display industry, said that pixel-to-pixel matches between laptop and projector were not mandatory, because proper software on the projector could handle many differences in input. ''The projector has to take inputs of all formats and display them on its panel, which has only one resolution,'' he said. ''A good projector can do this within limits.'' In this case, when I plugged the projector into the laptop, the projector recognized the laptop video input and automatically scaled down to S.V.G.A. The display was clear, easy to read and far preferable to having three people in a huddle around a laptop trying to decipher the same PowerPoint slides. I also plugged the Pocket Imager into my DVD player to watch the movie ''Infamous.'' The images were sharp, and, when I turned the lights down, the color was intense. No fan whirred in the projector during the movie; although L.E.D.'s throw off some heat, the amount is far less than that of arc lights, so no cooling fan is needed. Because of this quieter background, I thought that the small speakers built into the laptop would be adequate for listening to the movie soundtrack. They were, and I could follow the dialogue. But the sound would have been much improved by connecting the system to external speakers. The image was so compelling, though, that I had to force myself to turn off the show after 20 minutes and get back to work. We also tried out the NEC projector. It is easy to set up, and within moments it cast a huge image of both the PowerPoint show and then the movie on my living-room wall. I was ready to invite the neighbors over and serve popcorn. Although the portable projectors now on the market are already small, they will be shrinking even more, Mr. Chinnock said. On the horizon, he said, are 100-lumen L.E.D. projectors that put out 40-inch images that stand up to daylight. And even smaller, finger-tip-sized projectors will be arriving that can be used with cellphones and P.D.A.'s, he said. ''You'll be taking your presentation on a U.S.B. thumb drive and doing your slide shows from a cellphone,'' he said. ''There are going to be many ways to make the projector less tethered to a notebook.'' NOVELTIES E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com."
"Brooklyn's Borough Hall is 83 years older than the Empire State Building, about 98 stories shorter, and infinitely less likely to be scaled by a giant ape on the big screen. The buildings have little in common at all, in fact. But as of this month, they do share at least one thing: Both are equipped with lighting systems that let them change colors on special occasions, much as if they were towering stone-and-steel mood rings. The taller building, of course, has been lighting its upper floors in bright colors since 1976 -- red, white and blue for July 4, green and red for Christmas, blue and white when the Yankees win a championship, and many more. Now, as part of a renovation of Borough Hall that began in late 2004, Brooklyn officials have unveiled themed lights of their own: red and green for the moment, but soon blue and white for Hanukkah, which starts this evening, and then an array of other permutations. The people at Borough Hall do not shrink from comparisons between the two buildings. On the contrary, they have found that their state-of-the-art system, which employs 67 floodlights using light-emitting diodes programmed by computer -- as opposed to the changeable color films mounted by hand at the taller building -- gives them plenty to brag about. ''If you look at the Empire State Building, it's going to be red for Valentine's Day,'' said Enrique Garcia, the project's lighting designer for the firm Fisher Marantz Stone. ''What we have at Borough Hall is, in the evening when the lights go on, it can start out being red. And then it can change softly from red to white during the night, or the center can change colors.'' The system, he said, is a significant upgrade over the building's previous system, which used floodlights on poles in the adjacent plaza. ''The idea was to have half of the facade in blue and half in red,'' he said. ''But eventually they ended up with a sort of violet mixture.'' Both the old colored lights and the new ones are the brainchild of Borough President Marty Markowitz, who has been interested in lighting Borough Hall since he took office in 2002. Mr. Markowitz envisions lighting themes for all the major holidays, in addition to ethnic festivals for Irish, Italian, Russian and Pakistani heritage, among others. When there is no holiday, the building will be lighted in blue and gold, the official colors of Brooklyn. Mr. Markowitz hopes the project will set an example for other prominent buildings around the city. ''It was the city hall of Brooklyn, and now it's going to be the most magnificently lit borough hall in the city of New York, there's no question about that,'' he said. ''I think it makes a statement when public buildings are awash in colors.'' JAKE MOONEY NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN"
"ALEXANDER LERVIK, a Swede, knows about the gloom of long dark winters. So, as a designer striving to bring light to dim spaces, he has come up with illuminated versions of products that never glowed before: a door handle fitted with a light-emitting diode, or L.E.D., that shines bright red when the door is locked, and an illuminated children's swing. For Mr. Lervik, light ''changes the identity of a product and gives you more to work with, more expression.'' He is not alone in his fascination with light. Designers and manufacturers in many countries are now using miniaturized L.E.D. technology to wire everything from kitchen and bathroom fixtures to furniture and floor tile. Light is emerging as the medium of the moment. This fall, the German home products company Villeroy & Boch will begin selling Light Tiles -- ordinary-looking glazed clay tiles equipped with an L.E.D. device -- in the United States. Hit a wall switch and the tiles, which will cost $75 to $100 each and come with a 60-page installation manual, glow blue, white or amber. At a time when high-tech gadgets fill every corner of the house, ''people are receptive to light applications that go beyond ceiling lamps and sconces,'' said Rick Crane, tile sales manager for Villeroy & Boch. Mixing the elements of light and water is popular with many companies exploring this new field, but the combination comes at a price. Neve Rubinetterie, a small Italian faucet maker based outside Milan, will soon start selling a product in the United States called the Brick Glas. It is a faucet embedded in a rectangular block of transparent or frosted Plexiglas, which is lighted from below by a low-voltage L.E.D. The faucet costs about $1,500, which may be a bit steep for the opportunity to brush your teeth in the dark. But it is not as expensive as showering with light. Ondine, a luxury shower systems company in City of Industry, Calif., sells the Electric Light shower head, with 270 spray channels wired with fiber optic cables and a halogen light, for between $2,500 (for the chrome version) and $15,000 (24-carat gold). The color of the light is adjustable. ''If you like blue because it's more soothing, you can set the head to that,'' said Patty Gatto, marketing director at Ondine. The shower head was designed as a form of chromatherapy, which assigns healing properties to each color of the light spectrum and which has become a popular marketing tool for light product makers. Designers are jumping on the chromatherapy bandwagon, whether or not they are true believers. Jan Puylaert, a Dutch designer who runs an Italian design company called Wet, says he's not really a New Age type, but he believes that light gives you ''a nice energy and some invisible comfort, like plants.'' Mr. Puylaert's contributions to such comforts are a bathtub and a wash basin, made of lightweight polyethylene, which come with either a halogen light or an L.E.D., and sell for between $1,400 and $2,500 for the tub, and $250 and $500 for the basin. Torsten Neeland, a German designer based in London, says light is about ''stimulating the senses,'' even when its source is something as mundane as a coffee table. During London design week events last week, he showed such a table, the Oranienburg ($2,350) with three elliptical Corian tops that can swivel out from a pedestal base. A fluorescent light on the base casts a pink glow between the layers. The effect, Mr. Neeland said, ''reflects the power of color.'' These new forms of illumination are popular with consumers, manufacturers say, but some design-world purists are less impressed. Brooke Hodge, the curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, says in many of these cases, adding an element like light is ''an odd embellishment'' because it doesn't have a function. ''Light is a pleasant thing and you can use it to change the mood and atmosphere, like those watches with different colored faces,'' she said. ''But you have to ask, 'what does it do? Why is it there?'' The push to illuminate everything isn't all frivolous, according to Mr. Lervik. He got the idea for the Brighthandle door handle, which sells in the United States for about $150, while gazing at a ''do not disturb'' sign in a hotel. ''I thought, it might be possible to design the function of that sign into the door, to use light to communicate the same thing,'' Mr. Lervik explained. It may be simply the beauty of light that is attracting so many designers to it. After all, said Leni Schwendinger, a lighting artist in New York City who is working on a project to illuminate the Coney Island parachute jump, people love light because ''it fills the eye with brightness and delights.''
